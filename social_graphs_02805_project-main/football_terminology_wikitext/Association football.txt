'''Association football''', more commonly known as '''football''' or '''soccer''',{{efn|For further information, see [[names for association football]].}} is a [[team sport]] played between two teams of 11 [[Football player|players]] who almost exclusively use their feet to propel a [[Ball (association football)|ball]] around a rectangular field called a [[Football pitch|pitch]]. 

The objective of the game is to [[Scoring in association football|score]] more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed [[Goal (sport)|goal]] defended by the opponent. Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250&nbsp;million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.

Association football is played in accordance with the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]], a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the [[International Football Association Board|IFAB]] since 1886. The game is played with a football that is {{convert|68|–|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} in [[circumference]]. The two teams compete to score goals by getting the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts, under the bar, and fully across the goal line). When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may also use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball; the head, chest, and thighs are commonly used. Only the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] may use their hands and arms, but they may use their hands only within their own [[penalty area]]. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. Depending on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a [[Tie (draw)#Association football|draw]] being declared with 1 point awarded to each team, or the game may go into [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] or a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]].<ref name="laws51-52" />

Internationally, association football is governed by [[FIFA]]. Under FIFA, there are six continental confederations: [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]], [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]], [[CONCACAF]], [[CONMEBOL]], [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]], and [[UEFA]]. National associations (e.g. [[The Football Association|the FA]] in England, [[U.S. Soccer]] in the United States, etc.) are responsible for managing the game in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level, and coordinating competitions in accordance with the Laws of the Game. The most prestigious senior international competition is the [[FIFA World Cup]]. The men's World Cup is the most-viewed sporting event in the world, surpassing the [[Olympic Games]].<ref>{{cite web |date=5 December 2006 |title=2002 FIFA World Cup TV Coverage |url=https://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0,3509,10,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314003412/http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0%2C3509%2C10%2C00.html |archive-date=14 March 2005 |access-date=6 January 2008 |publisher=FIFA}}</ref> The most prestigious competition in European club football is the [[UEFA Champions League]], which attracts an extensive television audience worldwide.

Association football is part of a family of [[football]] codes that emerged from various [[ball games]] played worldwide since antiquity. The word "association" in this term refers to [[the Football Association]] (the FA), founded in [[London]] in 1863, which published the first set of rules for the sport that same year.<ref name="BLibrary">{{cite news |title=Football Association 1863 Minute Book |url=https://blogs.bl.uk/socialscience/2013/08/football-association-1863-minute-book.html |access-date=13 April 2025 |publisher=British Library |archive-date=13 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240913154542/https://blogs.bl.uk/socialscience/2013/08/football-association-1863-minute-book.html |url-status=live}}</ref> The term was coined to distinguish the type of football played in accordance with the FA rules from other types that were gaining popularity at the time, particularly [[rugby football]].<ref name="Etym">{{cite web |title=Etymology of "soccer" by etymonline |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/soccer |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=13 April 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250406093624/https://www.etymonline.com/word/soccer |archive-date=6 April 2025 |language=en |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:The Sportsman 1910-11-25 Football.png|thumb|Heading from The Sportsman (London) front page of 25 November 1910, illustrating the continued use of the word "football" to encompass both rugby and association football.]]

The term ''soccer'' comes from [[Oxford "-er"]] slang, which was prevalent at the [[University of Oxford]] in England from about 1875, and is thought to have been borrowed from the slang of [[Rugby School]]. Initially spelt ''assoccer'' (a shortening of "association"), it was later reduced to the modern spelling.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Perrigo |first1=Billy |title=Why Do Americans Call It Soccer Instead of Football?

The [[Cambridge rules]], first drawn up at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge rules were written at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], at a meeting attended by representatives from [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]] schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the [[Sheffield Football Club]], formed by former public school pupils in 1857,<ref>{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Adrian |title=Football, the first hundred years |publisher=Routledge |page=126 |year=2005 |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-35018-1}}</ref> which led to the formation of a [[Sheffield FA]] in 1867. In 1862, [[John Charles Thring]] of [[Uppingham School]] also devised an influential set of rules.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Winner |date=28 March 2005 |title=The hands-off approach to a man's game |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,27-1544006,00.html |access-date=7 October 2007 |location=London |archive-date=23 January 2014  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140123053942/http://web.archive.org/web/20100605085610/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article438583.ece |url-status=dead}}</ref>

These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of [[the Football Association]] (the FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the [[Freemasons' Tavern]] in [[Great Queen Street]], London.<ref name="FAhistory">{{cite web |title=History of the FA |publisher=The Football Association |url=http://www.thefa.com/about-football-association/history |access-date=9 October 2007 |archive-date=25 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125012322/http://www.thefa.com/about-football-association/history |url-status=live}}</ref> The only school to be represented on this occasion was [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]].

The 1863 FA rules included handling of the ball by "[[Mark (Australian rules football)#Origins of the mark|marks]]" and the lack of a crossbar, making the game remarkably similar to [[Victorian rules football]], which was being developed around the same time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s, with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.<ref name="Merger">{{cite book |last=Young |first=Percy M. |year=1964 |title=Football in Sheffield |pages=28–29 |publisher=S.

The best-documented early European team was founded by activist [[Nettie Honeyball]] in England in 1894: the [[British Ladies' Football Club]].

Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]. The game is played using a spherical ball of {{convert|68|–|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} circumference,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Circumference |url=http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Become-a-licensee/Tests/Circumference/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119053959/http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Become-a-licensee/Tests/Circumference/ |archive-date=19 November 2016 |website=FIFA Quality Programme}}</ref> known as the ''[[Ball (association football)|football]]'' (or ''soccer ball''). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. There are situations where a goal can be disallowed, such as an [[Offside (association football)|offside]] call or a [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|foul]] in the build-up to the goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a [[Captain (association football)|captain]] who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss before kick-off or [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kicks]].<ref name="laws51-52" />

The primary law is that players other than [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a [[throw-in]] restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their body (notably, "[[Header (association football)|heading]]" with the forehead)<ref>{{cite web |title=How to head a football |url=http://expertfootball.com/wp/heading/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110403141804/http://expertfootball.com/training/heading.php |archive-date=3 April 2011 |access-date=3 January 2011}}</ref> other than their hands or arms.<ref name="fouls">{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws12_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 12) |access-date=24 September 2007|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011115718/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws12_02.htm|archive-date=11 October 2007}}</ref> Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though players may not pass to teammates who are in an offside position.<ref name="offsidelaw">{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Law 11&nbsp;– Offside |chapter-url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |publisher=FIFA |access-date=4 March 2011 |page=31 |archive-date=4 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704211500/https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref>

During gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by [[dribbling]], passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through [[Tackle (football move)#Association football|tackling]] the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the [[Referee (association football)|referee]] for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.<ref name="restart">{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws8_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 8) |access-date=24 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142456/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws8_01.htm |archive-date=13 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the [[2022–23 Premier League|2022–23 season]] of the English [[Premier League]] produced an average of 2.85 goals per match.<ref>{{cite news |title=Seven graphs that explain the Premier League's goal glut |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/12/05/premier-league-more-goals-ever-five-reasons-data-tactics/ |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=5 December 2023 |access-date=21 January 2024 |last1=Ducker |first1=James |archive-date=16 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231216022320/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/12/05/premier-league-more-goals-ever-five-reasons-data-tactics/ |url-status=live}}</ref> The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper,<ref name=LAW301>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 3–Number of Players) |access-date=24 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142527/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_01.htm |archive-date=13 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> but a number of [[association football positions|specialised roles]] have evolved.<ref>{{cite web |title=Soccer positions explained: names, numbers and what they do |publisher=Bundesliga |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/soccer-positions-explained-names-numbers-what-they-do-2579-786 |access-date=3 February 2021 |archive-date=28 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210228222507/https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/soccer-positions-explained-names-numbers-what-they-do-2579-786 |url-status=live}}</ref> Broadly, these include three main categories: [[Striker (association football)|strikers]], or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; [[Defender (association football)|defenders]], who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and [[midfielder]]s, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Winter |first1=Henry |title=Schmeichel: I watch Federer to improve my game |url=https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/federers-my-idol-i-watch-him-play-tennis-to-improve-as-a-goalkeeper-2ngtfltl9?region=global |website=The Times |access-date=7 April 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250411213300/https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/federers-my-idol-i-watch-him-play-tennis-to-improve-as-a-goalkeeper-2ngtfltl9 |archive-date=11 April 2025 |date=2 April 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends the most time. For example, there are central defenders and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4196830.stm |title=Positions guide, Who is in a team? |work=BBC Sport |access-date=24 September 2007 |date=1 September 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105213730/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4196830.stm|archive-date=5 November 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> The layout of a team's players is known as a ''[[Formation (association football)|formation]]''.

There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulations and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football for both sexes, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors and people with physical disabilities are permitted.{{efn|name=Variants|See [[List of types of football#Games descended from the FA rules]] for a list of association football variations.}} The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game.

Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding [[substitute (association football)|substitutes]]), one of whom must be the [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]]. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the [[penalty area]] in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of [[association football positions|positions]] in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are [[sports strategy|strategically]] placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.<ref name=LAW301 />

The basic equipment or ''[[Kit (association football)|kit]]'' players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts,{{efn|All outfield players must wear shorts, while goalkeepers are permitted to wear tracksuit bottoms.}} socks, footwear and adequate [[shin guard]]s.

A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is five in 90 minutes,<ref>{{Cite web |date=13 June 2022 |title=Five substitutions permitted in all top-level competitions from 2022/23 |url=https://www.90min.com/posts/five-substitutions-permitted-in-all-top-level-competitions-from-2022-23 |access-date=13 January 2023 |website=90min.com |language=en |archive-date=13 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230113223015/https://www.90min.com/posts/five-substitutions-permitted-in-all-top-level-competitions-from-2022-23 |url-status=live}}</ref> with each team being allowed one more if the game should go into extra-time; the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in [[friendly matches]].

{{anchor|Match officials}}
A game is officiated by a [[referee (association football)|referee]], who has "full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant referees]]. In many high-level games there is also a [[fourth official]] who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws5_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 5 – The referee) |access-date=24 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913141909/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws5_01.htm |archive-date=13 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Goal line technology]] is used to measure if the whole ball has crossed the goal-line thereby determining whether a goal has been scored or not; this was brought in to prevent controversy. [[Video assistant referee]]s (VAR) have also been increasingly introduced in high-level matches to assist officials through video replays to correct clear and obvious mistakes. There are four types of calls that can be reviewed: mistaken identity in awarding a red or yellow card, goals and whether there was a violation during the build-up, direct red card decisions, and penalty decisions.<ref name="protocol">{{cite web |url=http://www.knvb.nl/downloads/bestand/9844/var-handbook-summary |title=Video Assistant Referees (VARs) Experiment – Protocol (Summary) |publisher=International Football Association Board |date=26 April 2017 |access-date=26 April 2017 |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427192145/http://www.knvb.nl/downloads/bestand/9844/var-handbook-summary |archive-date=27 April 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within [[IFAB]], the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in [[imperial units]]. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate [[SI|metric]] equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of [[metrication]] (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.<ref>{{cite news |title=Will we ever go completely metric? |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3934353.stm |date=2 September 2004 |last=Summers |first=Chris |access-date=7 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010064850/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3934353.stm|archive-date=10 October 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of {{cvt|100|-|110|m|yd}} and the width is in the range of {{cvt|64|-|75|m|yd|-1}}. Fields for non-international matches may be {{cvt|90|-|120|m|yd|round=5}} in length and {{cvt|45|-|90|m|yd|round=5}} in width, provided the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of {{cvt|105|m|yd}} long and {{cvt|68|m|yd}} wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches;<ref>{{cite web |date=8 March 2008 |title=Goal-line technology put on ice |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/ifab/media/news/newsid=707751/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322135616/https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/news/goal-line-technology-put-ice-707751|archive-date=22 March 2019|access-date=19 June 2010|url-status=dead |publisher=FIFA}}</ref> however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/77/82/55/circularno.1145-amendmentstothelawsofthegame-2008.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430044356/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/77/82/55/circularno.1145-amendmentstothelawsofthegame-2008.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 April 2011 |title=FIFA Amendments to the Laws of the Game, 2008 |publisher=FIFA |access-date=4 March 2011}}</ref>

In front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line {{cvt|16.5|m|yd|0}} from the goalposts and extending {{cvt|16.5|m|yd|0}} into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at [[Kick-off (association football)|kick-offs]], goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_03.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.3 – The field of play) |access-date=24 September 2007|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011084145/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_03.htm|archive-date=11 October 2007}}</ref>

=== Duration and tie-breaking methods ===

==== 90-minute ordinary time ====
A standard adult football match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time.<ref name="rule7.2" /> The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called "additional time" in FIFA documents,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/worldfootball/clubfootball/01/37/04/23/interpretation_law07_en.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721055324/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/worldfootball/clubfootball/01/37/04/23/interpretation_law07_en.pdf|archive-date=21 July 2012 |title=Interpretation of the Laws of the Game&nbsp;– Law 07|url-status=dead |publisher=FIFA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/refereeing/law_7_the_duration_of_the_match_en_47401.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304214713/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/refereeing/law_7_the_duration_of_the_match_en_47401.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 March 2011 |title=Law 7 – The Duration of the Match |publisher=FIFA}}</ref> but is most commonly referred to as ''stoppage time'' or ''injury time'', while ''lost time'' can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is [[Ball in and out of play|out of play]], and a 90-minute game typically involves about an hour of "effective playing time".<ref>{{cite news |title=Football reforms: Scrapping 45-minute half to be debated at Ifab |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40311889|access-date=7 March 2018 |work=BBC Sport |date=18 June 2017|archive-date=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322022354/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40311889|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/world-cup-stoppage-time-is-wildly-inaccurate/amp/ We Timed Every Game.

[[File:Didier Drogba Manuel Neuer last penalty kick Champions League Final 2012.jpg|alt=|thumb|Most knockout competitions use a [[Penalty shoot-out (football)|penalty shoot-out]] to decide the winner if a match ends as a draw]]
In league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required, various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock; some competitions may invoke [[Replay (sports)|replays]].<ref>For example, in the [[FA Cup]] prior to the semi-finals.</ref> A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-outs]] (previously known in the Laws of the Game as "kicks from the penalty mark")<ref>{{cite web |title=Laws of the Game 2023/24 |url=https://www.theifab.com/downloads/laws-of-the-game-2023-24?l=en |website=Documents {{!}} IFAB |publisher=IFAB |access-date=9 April 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240418164636/https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/laws-of-the-game-2023-24?l=en |archive-date=18 April 2024 |page=151 |language=en |url-status=live}}</ref> to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament or be the champion.

In competitions using [[two-legged match]]es, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the [[away goals rule]] may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shoot-out are required.<ref name="laws51-52" />

=== Ball in and out of play ===
{{Main|Ball in and out of play}}
[[File:Shunsuke1 20080622.jpg|thumb|A player takes a free kick, while the opposition form a "wall" to try to block the ball|alt=]]
Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ''ball in play'' and ''ball out of play''. From the beginning of each [[playing period]] with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:

* [[Kick-off (association football)|Kick-off]]: following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play.<ref name="restart" />
* [[Throw-in]]: when the ball has crossed the touchline; awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws15_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 15 – The Throw-in) |access-date=14 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142556/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws15_01.htm |archive-date=13 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
* [[Goal kick]]: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the attacking team; awarded to defending team.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws16_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 16 – The Goal Kick) |access-date=14 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913141725/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws16_01.htm |archive-date=13 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

* [[Indirect free kick]]: awarded to the opposing team following "non-penal" fouls, certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution or dismiss an opponent without a specific foul having occurred. A goal may not be scored directly (without the ball first touching another player) from an indirect free kick.<ref name="freekick">{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws13_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 13 – Free Kicks) |access-date=14 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142645/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws13_01.htm |archive-date=13 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
* [[Direct free kick]]: awarded to fouled team following certain listed "penal" fouls.<ref name="freekick" /> A goal may be scored directly from a direct free kick.
* [[Penalty kick (association football)|Penalty kick]]: awarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws14_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 14 – The Penalty Kick) |access-date=14 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142717/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws14_01.htm |archive-date=13 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
* [[Dropped-ball]]: occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason, such as a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective.<ref name="restart" />

}}
A [[foul (football)|foul]] occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of "penal fouls", punishable by a [[direct free kick]] or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an [[indirect free kick]].<ref name="fouls" />

The referee may punish a player's or substitute's [[misconduct (football)|misconduct]] by a caution ([[Penalty card|yellow card]]) or dismissal ([[Penalty card|red card]]). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been "booked", the referee writing the player's name in their official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of "unsporting behaviour" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute, substituted player, and to non-players such as managers and support staff.<ref name="fouls" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=13 May 2020 |title=How cards for managers has improved behaviour in the technical area |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/managers-yellow-red-cards-behaviour-technical-area-a9512561.html |access-date=13 January 2023 |website=The Independent |language=en |archive-date=13 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230113223013/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/managers-yellow-red-cards-behaviour-technical-area-a9512561.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as "playing an advantage".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4188646.stm |title=Referee's signals: advantage |work=BBC Sport |access-date=4 March 2011 |date=14 September 2005 |archive-date=12 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112055936/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4188646.stm |url-status=live}}</ref> The referee may "call back" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within "a few seconds". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.<ref>{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Law 5: The Referee: Advantage |chapter-url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |publisher=FIFA |access-date=4 March 2011 |page=66 |archive-date=4 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704211500/https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final. The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including whether a goal was awarded or not) were incorrect.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Laws of the Game |chapter=Law 5: The Referee |chapter-url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2011_12_en.pdf |publisher=FIFA |access-date=5 May 2012 |page=24 |archive-date=6 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806182803/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2011_12_en.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Along with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, [[Doping in sport|doping]], [[Age fraud in association football|age fraud]] and [[match fixing]]. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game.<ref name=FAsuspensions>For example, see [[the Football Association]]'s rules regarding player suspensions in FA competitions: {{cite web |title=Disciplinary procedures |url=http://www.thefa.com/~/media/files/thefaportal/governance-docs/rules-of-the-association/2015-16/031g_memorandum-of-disciplinary-procedures-_section-d.ashx |publisher=The Football Association|access-date=1 February 2016|archive-date=6 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106181545/http://www.thefa.com/~/media/files/thefaportal/governance-docs/rules-of-the-association/2015-16/031g_memorandum-of-disciplinary-procedures-_section-d.ashx|url-status=live}}</ref> Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card.{{efn|For example, the [[English Premier League]] fined and levied an 8-match suspension on [[Luis Suárez]] for [[Luis Suárez#Racial abuse incident|racially abusing]] [[Patrice Evra]].}} Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.<ref name=FAsuspensions />

Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, point deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the [[English Football League]] deduct 12 points from any team that enters [[Administration (British football)|financial administration]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Football League administration penalty raised to 12 points |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33027933|access-date=17 May 2018 |work=BBC Sport |date=5 June 2015|archive-date=4 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180804233939/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33027933|url-status=live}}</ref> Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture.

National associations (or national federations) oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states (for example, the [[Cameroonian Football Federation]] in Cameroon), but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example, the [[Scottish Football Association]] in Scotland). 211 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations.<ref name="confeds" /> Other national associations may be members of continental confederations but otherwise [[Non-FIFA international football|not participate in FIFA competitions]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vázquez |first1=Luis Guillermo |last2=Hall |first2=Andy |title=Which CONCACAF teams are not recognized by FIFA? |url=https://en.as.com/soccer/which-concacaf-teams-are-not-recognized-by-fifa-n/ |website=AS USA |access-date=11 April 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241110143536/https://en.as.com/soccer/which-concacaf-teams-are-not-recognized-by-fifa-n/ |archive-date=10 November 2024 |language=en |date=9 October 2024 |url-status=live}}</ref>

While FIFA is responsible for organising international competitions and enforcing most international regulations, the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] are set by the [[International Football Association Board|IFAB]], where each of the four UK associations holds one vote and FIFA collectively holds four votes.<ref name="FIFA" />

[[File:Forcejeo Real Madrid - FC Barcelona.jpg|thumb|A 2009 Spanish [[La Liga]] match between [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].

In each country, football clubs are usually federated in associations or leagues that organise official tournaments among themselves, from which the champion of each country and the teams that will participate in international club tournaments emerge. There is no single system of competitions, and each national league organises them according to its own traditions.<ref>{{cite web |title=How is European soccer structured with leagues and cup competitions? |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/faq/what-are-the-rules-and-regulations-of-soccer/how-is-european-soccer-structured-with-leagues-and-cup-competitions-10568 |website=www.bundesliga.com |access-date=8 April 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250223035347/https://www.bundesliga.com/en/faq/what-are-the-rules-and-regulations-of-soccer/how-is-european-soccer-structured-with-leagues-and-cup-competitions-10568 |archive-date=23 February 2025 |language=en |url-status=live}}</ref>

The governing bodies in each country operate [[league system]]s in a [[Domestic association football season|domestic season]], normally comprising several [[division (sport)|divisions]], in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results, usually [[three points for a win]], one for a draw and zero for a defeat. Teams are put into [[Table (information)|tables]], placed in order according to points accrued. In the [[Old World]] (Africa, Asia and Europe), it is common for each team to play every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a [[round-robin tournament]]. At the end of a season, which typically runs from August to May, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be [[promotion and relegation|promoted]] to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to a lower division.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fort |first=Rodney |title=European and North American Sports Differences(?) |journal=Scottish Journal of Political Economy |date=September 2000 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=431–55 |doi=10.1111/1467-9485.00172}}</ref>

Some exceptions to this system occur in the [[New World]] (Americas) and Australia:

* The majority of the Latin American leagues (including [[Liga MX]] from Mexico and [[Argentine Primera División|Liga Profesional de Fútbol]] from Argentina) divide football championships into two sections named [[Apertura and Clausura]] (Spanish for ''Opening'' and ''Closing''), awarding a champion for each.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/latinamerica/story/Estudiantes-win-Argentina-Apertura-title |title=Estudiantes win Argentina Apertura title |date=13 December 2010 |work=Fox Sports |agency=Associated Press |quote=Under the system used in Argentina and most of Latin America, two season titles are awarded each year&nbsp;– the Apertura and Clausura. |access-date=4 March 2011 |archive-date=23 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623075034/http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/latinamerica/story/Estudiantes-win-Argentina-Apertura-title |url-status=live}}</ref> After a first phase using points in a round-robin tournament, these leagues usually have a knockout phase, with a final deciding the champion of each Apertura and Clausura tournament. In some countries, such as Uruguay,<ref>{{cite web |title=En Uruguay, Liverpool hizo historia con un ex Boca |url=https://www.ole.com.ar/futbol-internacional/america/liverpool-campeon-uruguayo-2023-uruguay-final-penarol_0_FMaGvJeFmQ.html |website=Olé |access-date=8 April 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240921033848/https://www.ole.com.ar/futbol-internacional/america/liverpool-campeon-uruguayo-2023-uruguay-final-penarol_0_FMaGvJeFmQ.html |archive-date=21 September 2024 |language=es |date=17 December 2023 |url-status=live}}</ref> the winners of the Apertura and Clausura play each other in a play-off for the season title.
* The [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Brazilian Série A]] ("Brasileirão") uses a single-season double round-robin format to determine the champion, similar to most European leagues, although it is played from April or May to December.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Oliveira |first1=Letícia |title=Como funciona o Campeonato Brasileiro?

* [[Major League Soccer]] in the United States and Canada uses a closed league system (without promotion and relegation) and a conference system, similar to that used in other sports leagues in both countries. In each conference, clubs play a round-robin schedule during the regular season, and those with the most points qualify for the play-offs, which conclude with a final to determine the champion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Competition Guidelines |url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/about/competition-guidelines |website=MLS soccer |access-date=8 April 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250401063727/https://www.mlssoccer.com/about/competition-guidelines |archive-date=1 April 2025 |language=en |url-status=live}}</ref>
* The [[A-League Men|A-League]] in Australia also uses a closed league system. At the end of a regular season played in a round-robin format, the clubs with the most points compete in play-offs to determine the league champion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Documents and Rules |url=https://aleagues.com.au/more/official-documents/ |website=A-Leagues |access-date=8 April 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250314113938/https://aleagues.com.au/more/official-documents/ |archive-date=14 March 2025 |language=en |url-status=live}}</ref>

The teams finishing at the top of a country's league may also be eligible to play in [[List of association football competitions|international club competitions]] in the following season. Most countries supplement the league system with one or more "cup" competitions organised on a [[single elimination tournament|knock-out]] basis. These include the [[domestic cup]], which may be open to all eligible teams in a country's league system—both professional and amateur—and is organised by the national federation.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rueter |first=Jeff |date=22 August 2023 |title=What is the U.S. Open Cup?

Variants of association football have been codified for teams of reduced size, such as [[five-a-side football]]; for non-traditional playing environments, including [[beach soccer]], [[futsal]] and [[indoor soccer]]; and for athletes with disabilities ([[Paralympic football]]).
