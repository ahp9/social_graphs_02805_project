==In football games==

One of the more famous displays of keepie-uppie was in the [[British Home Championship#1967: Scotland become ‘World Champions’|1967 Scotland–England football match]], where Scottish midfielder [[Jim Baxter]] juggled the ball for some time in front of the English defence, taunting them by keeping possession. This allowed Scotland to keep possession and use up the remaining few minutes, leading to a 3–2 victory for Scotland over the world champions. "That's a defining moment for almost every football fan in Scotland irrespective of where their club allegiance lies," said football historian [[Bob Crampsey]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/scotland/1187184.stm|work = [[BBC Sport]]|date=14 April 2001|title=Tributes to Jim Baxter}}</ref>
