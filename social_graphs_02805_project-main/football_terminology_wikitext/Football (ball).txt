{{Short description|Ball used in the sport of football}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2020}}
A '''football''' is a [[ball]] inflated with air that is used to play one of the various sports known as [[football]]. In these games, with some exceptions, [[Goal (sport)|goals]] or [[Score (sport)|points]] are scored only when the ball enters one of two designated goal-scoring areas; football games involve the two teams each trying to move the ball in opposite directions along the [[field of play]].

The first balls were made of natural materials, such as an inflated [[pig bladder]], later put inside a leather cover, which has given rise to the American slang-term "pigskin". Modern balls are designed by teams of engineers to exacting specifications, with rubber or plastic bladders, and often with plastic covers. Various leagues and games use different balls, though they all have one of the following basic shapes:
# A [[sphere]], used in [[association football]] and [[Gaelic football]]
# A [[prolate spheroid]] (elongated sphere), used in the [[rugby football|rugby]] codes and [[Australian rules football|Australian football]]
# A [[Lemon (geometry)|lemon]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Weisstein |first=Eric W. |title=Lemon Surface |url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LemonSurface.html |access-date=2024-10-31 |website=mathworld.wolfram.com |language=en}}</ref> used in [[gridiron football]]
The precise shape and construction of footballs is typically specified as part of the [[Regulation of sport|rules and regulations]].

[[Laws of the Game (association football)|Law 2 of the game]] specifies that the ball is an air-filled [[sphere]] with a [[circumference]] of {{convert|68|-|70|cm|in|abbr=on}}, a [[Mass|weight]] of {{convert|410|-|450|g|oz|abbr=on}}, inflated to a [[pressure]] of 0.6 to 1.1&nbsp;[[technical atmosphere|atmospheres]] ({{convert|60|-|111|kPa|psi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) "at sea level", and covered in leather or "other suitable material".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603165236/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 June 2007 |title=Laws of the Game |publisher=FIFA |access-date=30 May 2011}}</ref> The weight specified for a ball is the dry weight, as older balls often became significantly heavier in the course of a match played in wet weather. There are a number of different types of football balls depending on the match and turf including: training footballs, match footballs, professional match footballs, beach footballs, street footballs, indoor footballs, turf balls, futsal footballs and mini/skills footballs.<ref>[http://www.soccer.com/guide/soccer-ball-guide/ Soccer Balls] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920022136/http://www.soccer.com/guide/soccer-ball-guide/ |date=20 September 2013 }}, [http://soccer.com/ Soccer], 2013-10-14.

Most modern Association footballs are stitched from 32 panels of waterproofed leather or plastic: 12 regular [[pentagon]]s and 20 regular [[hexagon]]s are used because of its contrasting colors, which makes it easier for viewers to follow the movement.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-06-18 |title=Why do you think of that black and white design if you say "soccer ball"? |url=https://gigazine.net/gsc_news/en/20180618-classic-soccer-ball-design |access-date=2025-04-24 |website=GIGAZINE |language=en}}</ref>  The 32-panel configuration is the [[spherical polyhedron]] corresponding to the [[truncated icosahedron]]; it is spherical because the faces bulge from the pressure of the air inside. The first 32-panel ball was marketed by [[SELECT Sport A/S|Select]] in the 1950s in Denmark. This configuration became common throughout [[Continental Europe]] in the 1960s, and was publicised worldwide by the [[Adidas Telstar]], the official ball of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]]. This design in often referenced when describing the truncated icosahedron [[Archimedean solid]], carbon [[Fullerene|buckyballs]], or the root structure of [[geodesic dome]]s.

==Australian rules football==
[[File:Sherrin Lyrebird Full Size ball, taken 2014.jpg|thumb|An [[Australian rules football]] by [[Sherrin]]]]
The football used in [[Australian rules football|Australian football]] is similar to a rugby ball but generally slightly smaller and more rounded at the ends, but more elongated in overall appearance, being longer by comparison with its width than a rugby ball. A regulation football is {{convert|720|-|730|mm|in}} in circumference, and {{convert|545|-|555|mm|in|abbr=on}} transverse circumference, and inflated to a pressure of {{convert|62|-|76|kPa|psi|abbr=on}}. In the [[Australian Football League|AFL]], the balls are red for day matches and yellow for night matches.

The first games of Australian football were played with a round ball, because balls of that shape were more readily available. In 1860, Australian football pioneer [[Tom Wills]] argued that the oval rugby ball travelled further in the air and made for a more exciting game.<ref>[[Martin Flanagan (journalist)|Flanagan, Martin]]. [http://australianfootball.com/articles/view/Why%2BTom%2BWills%2Bis%2Ban%2BAustralian%2Blegend%2Blike%2BNed%2BKelly/133 "Why Tom Wills is an Australian legend like Ned Kelly"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002040245/https://australianfootball.com/articles/view/Why+Tom+Wills+is+an+Australian+legend+like+Ned+Kelly/133 |date=2 October 2018 }}, Australian Football. Retrieved 7 November 2013.</ref> It became customary in Australian football by the 1870s.

The Australian football ball was invented by T. W. Sherrin in 1880, after he was given a misshapen rugby ball to fix. Sherrin designed the ball with indented rather than pointy ends to give the ball a better bounce.

Australian football ball brands include [[Burley-Sekem|Burley]], Ross Faulkner, and [[Sherrin]] (the brand used by the [[Australian Football League]]).

==Gaelic football==

[[File:Gaelic football ball on pitch.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.9|[[Gaelic football]] ball by [[O'Neills]]]]
The game is played with a round leather football made of 18 stitched leather panels, similar in appearance to a traditional [[volleyball (ball)|volleyball]] (but larger), with a circumference of {{convert|68|-|70|cm|abbr=on|in}}, weighing between {{convert|480|-|500|g|abbr=on|oz}} when dry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/mm/Document/TheGAA/RulesandRegulations/12/66/56/2016OfficialGuide-Part2_English.pdf|title=GAA Official Guide 2016, Part 2, Rule 4.4 ii (p.16)|access-date=10 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103225233/http://www.gaa.ie/mm/Document/TheGAA/RulesandRegulations/12/66/56/2016OfficialGuide-Part2_English.pdf|archive-date=3 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> It may be kicked or ''hand passed''. A hand pass is not a punch but rather a strike of the ball with the side of the closed fist, using the knuckle of the thumb.

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the term football usually refers to a ball made of cow hide leather, which is required in professional and [[college football|collegiate]] football. Footballs used in [[recreation]] and in organized youth leagues may be made of [[rubber]] or plastic materials (the [[high school football]] rulebooks still allow the inexpensive all-rubber footballs, though they are less common than leather). Since 1941, [[Horween Leather Company]] has been the exclusive supplier of leather for National Football League footballs.<ref>{{cite web |date=7 February 2010 |title=The NFL's centenarians |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/story/2012/5/17/the-nfls-centenarians/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014175541/http://www.profootballhof.com/story/2012/5/17/the-nfls-centenarians/ |archive-date=14 October 2013 |access-date=27 March 2013 |publisher=Profootballhof.com}}</ref><ref name="google2">{{cite magazine |author=Scott Oldham |date=October 2001 |title=Bombs Away |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g88DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA67 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230204031037/https://books.google.com/books?id=g88DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA67 |archive-date=4 February 2023 |access-date=17 October 2016 |magazine=Popular Mechanics}}</ref><ref name="google1">{{cite book |author=John Maxymuk |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gw3_obTNh4QC&pg=PA377 |title=NFL Head Coaches: A Biographical Dictionary, 1920–2011 |publisher=McFarland |year=2001 |isbn=9780786465576 |access-date=17 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230204031041/https://books.google.com/books?id=Gw3_obTNh4QC&pg=PA377 |archive-date=4 February 2023 |url-status=live}}</ref> The arrangement was established by [[Arnold Horween]], who had played and coached in the NFL.<ref name="chicagotribune2003">{{cite news |author=Barbara Rolek |date=27 October 2003 |title=Horween's leather bound by tradition |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/2003/10/27/horweens-leather-bound-by-tradition/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513162245/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-10-27/business/0310270217_1_bob-clevenhagen-rawlings-glove |archive-date=13 May 2013 |access-date=27 March 2013 |work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> Horween Leather Company also supplies leather to [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]], supplier of balls to the [[Arena Football League]].<ref name="encyclopedia1">{{cite book |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3479900049.html |title=Horween Leather Company |publisher=encyclopedia.com |access-date=26 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718184440/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3479900049.html |archive-date=18 July 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Leather panels are typically tanned to a natural brown color, which is usually required in professional leagues and collegiate play. At least one manufacturer{{who|date=December 2024}} uses leather that has been [[leather tanning|tanned]] to provide a "tacky" grip in dry or wet conditions. Historically, white footballs have been used in games played at night so that the ball can be seen more easily{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} however, improved artificial lighting conditions have made this no longer necessary. At most levels of play (but not, notably, the [[National Football League|NFL]]), white stripes are painted on each end of the ball, halfway around the circumference, to improve nighttime visibility and also to differentiate the college football from the pro football{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. However, the NFL once explored the usage of white-striped footballs – in [[Super Bowl VIII]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Kerry Byrne |title='The Duke' is back!" (subtitle - "The white stripes") |url=http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/content/the-duke-is-back/5291/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307041430/http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/content/the-duke-is-back/5291/ |archive-date=7 March 2014 |access-date=3 August 2006 |publisher=Coldhardfootballfacts.com}}</ref>

In the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] the stripes traverse the entire circumference of the ball. The [[United Football League (2009)|UFL]] used a ball with lime-green stripes. The [[XFL (2001)|XFL of 2001]] used a novel color pattern, a black ball with red curved lines in lieu of stripes, for its footballs; this design was redone in a tan and navy color scheme for the [[Arena Football League (1987–2008)|Arena Football League]] in 2003. A ball with red, white and blue panels was introduced in the [[American Indoor Football]] League in 2005 and used by its successors, as well as the [[Ultimate Indoor Football League]] of the early 2010s and the [[Can-Am Indoor Football League]] during its lone season in 2017. The [[XFL (2020)|XFL of 2020]] uses standard brown but with X markings on each point instead of stripes.

Footballs used in gridiron-style games have prominent points on both ends. The shape is generally credited to official [[Shorty Ray|Hugh "Shorty" Ray]], who introduced the new ball in 1934 as a way to make the [[forward pass]] more effective.<ref name="BS">{{cite news |author=Seymour Smith |date=14 September 1966 |title=Pro Football To Honor Ray: Rules Advisor's Ideas Gave Game Needed Boost |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7676652/pro_football_to_honor_ray/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026002507/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7676652/pro_football_to_honor_ray/ |archive-date=26 October 2017 |access-date=25 October 2017 |newspaper=The Sun (Baltimore) |page=C4}}</ref>

== Rugby football ==
{{main|Rugby ball}}

Until 1870, rugby was played with a near spherical ball with an inner-tube made of a pig's bladder. In 1870 [[Richard Lindon]] and Bernardo Solano started making balls for [[Rugby School|Rugby school]] out of hand stitched, four-panel, leather casings and pigs' bladders. The rugby ball's distinctive shape is supposedly due to the pig's bladder, although early balls were more plum-shape than oval. The balls varied in size in the beginning depending upon how large the pig's bladder was.<ref>Simon Hawkesley. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311213720/http://www.richardlindon.com/ Official Richard Lindon Site]. Retrieved 7 August 2008.</ref> Because of the pliability of rubber the shape gradually changed from a sphere to an egg. In 1892 the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] endorsed ovalness as the compulsory shape. The gradual flattening of the ball continued over the years.<ref name="BMA">[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/feb/05/rugbyunion.features Blood, mud and aftershave] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305011036/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/feb/05/rugbyunion.features |date=5 March 2017 }} in [[The Observer]] Sunday 5 February 2006, Section ''B is for Ball'' by Oliver Price</ref>
The introduction of synthetic footballs over the traditional leather balls, in both rugby codes, was originally governed by weather conditions. If the playing surface was wet, the synthetic ball was used, because it wouldn't absorb water and become heavy. Eventually, the leather balls were phased out completely.

===Rugby league===

[[Rugby league]] is played with a prolate spheroid shaped football which is inflated with air.<ref name="RLIF-ILG-2004-p8">{{cite web |author= |year=2024 |title=Section 3: The ball |url=https://intrl.sport/uploads/docs/international-rugby-league-laws-of-the-game-2022%20%283%29.pdf |access-date= |work=2024 INTERNATIONAL LAWS OF THE GAME WITH NOTES ON THE LAWS |publisher=International Rugby League |page=}}</ref> A referee will stop play immediately if the ball does not meet the requirements of size and shape.<ref name="RLIF-ILG-2004-p8"/> Traditionally made of brown leather, modern footballs are synthetic and manufactured in a variety of colours and patterns.

Smaller-sized balls are used for junior versions of the game, such as "Mini" and "[[Mod league|Mod]]". A full size ball weighs between {{convert|383|and|440|g|oz|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2024}} Rugby league footballs are slightly more pointed than rugby union footballs and larger than American footballs.{{fact|date=May 2025}}

The Australasian [[National Rugby League]] and [[Super League]] use balls made by [[Steeden]]. Steeden is also sometimes used in Australia as a noun to describe the ball itself.{{fact|date=May 2025}}

===Rugby union===
The ball used in rugby union, usually referred to as a rugby ball, is a prolate spheroid essentially [[ellipse|elliptical]] in profile. Traditionally made of brown leather, modern footballs are manufactured in a variety of colours and patterns. A regulation football is {{convert|28|-|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|58|-|62|cm|in|abbr=on}} in circumference at its widest point. It weighs {{convert|410|-|460|g|oz|abbr=on}} and is inflated to {{convert|65.7|-|68.8|kPa|psi|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby365.com/Laws_And_Referees/The_Laws/story_214.shtml |title=Rugby Union: Law 2 – The ball |date=15 January 2007 |access-date=30 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070115054533/http://www.rugby365.com/Laws_And_Referees/The_Laws/story_214.shtml |archive-date=15 January 2007 }}</ref>
