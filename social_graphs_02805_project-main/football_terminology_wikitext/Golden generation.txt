In [[sport]], a '''Golden Generation''', or '''Golden Team''' is an exceptionally gifted group of players of similar age, whose achievements reach or are expected to reach a level of success beyond that which their team had previously achieved. The term was first being cited by the media for Portugal's success during the FIFA Youth Championships in both 1989 and 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/513450/20131013/england-steven-gerrard-frank-lampard-figo-denis.htm |title=Curse of the Golden Generations: The Unrewarded Exploits of Bergkamp, Figo, Drogba and England – International Business Times UK |publisher=Ibtimes.co.uk |date=2013-10-13 |access-date=2013-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espnfc.com/team/belgium/459/blog/post/1923296/belgium-golden-generation|title=Belgium Golden Generation – ESPN FC|work=ESPNFC.com|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> Alternatively, it can describe a group of players at a club, who typically are the same age group and often came through the club academy together.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/what-is-class-of-92-man-utd-stars-salford-fa-cup-man-city-b1204128.html|publisher=The Standard|author=Matt Verri|title=What is the Class of 92?

At the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Belgium performed excellently, earning themselves a third-place finish. Captain Hazard won the Silver Ball as the second best player of the tournament behind [[Luka Modrić]] whereas goalkeeper Courtois was awarded the Golden Glove for his performance during the tournament.

==== Croatia (1996–1999, 2017–2024) ====
{{Expand section|date=November 2025}}
Croatia's first golden football generation was the team from the late 1990s, which in their first ever major international competition at the [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996 EURO]] played the quarter-finals against Germany and won the bronze medal at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] which was also their first ever World Cup appearance. This generation is remembered for key players like [[Davor Šuker]], [[Zvonimir Boban]], [[Robert Prosinečki]], and [[Robert Jarni]]. The team's success, including Šuker winning the Golden Boot, earned them a third-place [[FIFA Men's World Ranking|FIFA ranking]] in January 1999 marking the fastest ascension in FIFA ranking history and established them as a major force in international football.{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}[[File:Croatia's post-match huddle after the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.jpg|thumb|Croatia players posing with [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović]] after the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final]]]]

==== Denmark (1981–1992) ====
Starting with the appointment of [[Sepp Piontek]] as the head coach of the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national football team]] in 1979, the team achieved remarkable results, including a 3-1 win against reigning World Champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in 1981, a 1-0 win against [[England national football team|England]] at [[Wembley Stadium]], before qualifying for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico, the first time ever in Danish football history. During the 1986 World Cup, the Danish team won all three group stage matches, including a remarkable 6-1 win against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], and the team was nicknamed "Danish Dynamite" following a chant introduced in 1983.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bt.dk/em/historien-bag-det-danske-verdenshit-saadan-opstod-danish-dynamite |work=BT.dk |title=Historien bag det danske verdenshit: Sådan opstod 'Danish Dynamite' |date=June 21, 2021 }}</ref>

Sepp Piontek left the team in 1990. Following this, the team failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 1992]]. However, due to the [[Yugoslav Wars]], Denmark took [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia's]] place in the tournament, eventually winning the tournament following a 2-0 win against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the final.<ref>{{cite web |title=Euro 1992: Denmark's fairytale |first=Saj |last=Chowdhury |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/17757335|website=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=12 May 2012 |access-date=24 March 2025 }}</ref>

During the reign of [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]], [[Adam Crozier]], the chief executive of [[the Football Association]] and some members of the British media, touted players such as [[David Beckham]], [[Paul Scholes]], [[Michael Owen]], and [[Steven Gerrard]] as the nucleus of a potential Golden Generation team. Despite some impressive performances such as the [[2001 Germany v England football match]] in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers and the individual players' successes at club level, inconsistency resulted in this group of players failing to live up to expectations, resulting in the group becoming synonymous with disappointment and failed potential.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/aug/18/england | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=McClaren ends the golden era | date=August 18, 2006 | first=Kevin | last=McCarra}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jul/09/worldcup2006.sport2 | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=England's golden generation are just big heads | date=July 9, 2006 | first=Paul | last=Wilson}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5137638.stm | work=BBC News | title=End of road for wayward England | date=July 2, 2006 | first=Phil | last=McNulty}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/internationals/article1826303.ece |location=London |work=The Independent |title=Eco Chic: All ethically made over |date=November 23, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106081248/http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/internationals/article1826303.ece |archive-date=November 6, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= England, Beckham booted from Euro 2008|work= [[MSNBC]]|url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21920060/|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071123112846/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21920060/|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2007-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/sam-wallace-golden-generation-fell-short-of-the-highest-standards-ndash-but-england-will-miss-them-2345567.html | title=Sam Wallace: 'Golden generation' fell short of the highest standards – but England will miss them |location=London | work=The Independent | first=Sam | last=Wallace | date=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

After Eriksson left in 2006 and [[Steve McClaren]] became manager, although many of the players continued to achieve success with their respective clubs, the team failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2008]], only the second time England failed to qualify for a major tournament in over 20 years (of the last 12 major tournaments).

With the rise of stars such as [[Harry Kane]], [[Jamie Vardy]], [[Dele Alli]], [[Kyle Walker]], [[Jordan Henderson]], [[Kieran Trippier]], [[Raheem Sterling]],  [[Harry Maguire]], [[Eric Dier]], [[John Stones]], and other youngsters, England again became a powerhouse in world football, claiming 4th place at the [[FIFA World Cup 2018]] and maintaining a top 5 place in the [[FIFA Men's World Ranking|FIFA rankings]] since October of that year.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://inside.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ENG?gender=men | title=Inside FIFA }}</ref> In the next few years, numerous young talents continued to emerge.

At the [[Euro 2024]], England again reached the final with the addition of [[Cole Palmer]], although they lost to Spain 1–2 in the final.

==== France (1998–2006, 2016–present) ====
In late 1998, the [[France national football team]] began a period of international dominance defeating [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 3–0 to win the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], becoming the first French team to win the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. Two years later, [[David Trezeguet]]'s golden goal in extra time gave France a 2–1 win over [[Italy national football team|Italy]] to give France the [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000 European Championship]]. France was subsequently ranked No. 1 in the [[FIFA World Rankings]] and ranked No. 1 in the [[World Football Elo Ratings]] for two years. The team also secured the [[2001 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. Despite this impressive recent record, the French team flopped at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], losing to newcomers Senegal in the opening match of the tournament and crashing out in the group stages without scoring a single goal and taking only one point from their three games. A year later they were successful at the [[2003 FIFA Confederations Cup]], winning the competition after beating [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] in the [[2003 FIFA Confederations Cup final|final]] thanks to a [[golden goal]] from Thierry Henry.

For the first time in 6 years, they reached the knockout stages of an international tournament advancing from the group stages of the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 Euros]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] before being knocked out in the quarter-finals of both competitions by [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and [[Germany national football team|Germany]] respectively. In 2016, they reached the [[UEFA Euro 2016 final|final]] of the [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euros]], with [[Antoine Griezmann]] being star player, being awarded player of the tournament and the golden boot. Then in 2018, they won the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]], beating Croatia 4–2 in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup final|final]] and thus starting a new golden generation of players including [[Kylian Mbappé|Kylian Mbappe]], [[Ousmane Dembélé|Ousmane Dembele]], [[Paul Pogba]], [[Antoine Griezmann]], [[Olivier Giroud]], [[N'Golo Kanté|N'Golo Kante]], [[Hugo Lloris]], [[Benjamin Pavard]], [[Lucas Hernandez]], [[Presnel Kimpembe]], [[Samuel Umtiti]], [[Raphaël Varane|Raphael Varane]] and [[Blaise Matuidi]].

In 2022, they reached the [[2022 FIFA World Cup final|World Cup final]] but eventually lost to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] on penalties, despite Kylian Mbappe scoring a [[hat-trick]] in the final, being the first player to do so since [[Geoff Hurst]] in 1966 against West Germany. In 2024, France reached the semi-finals of the [[Euro 2024]] despite not scoring a goal from open play in their previous games, owing to the solidity of their defence. However, the team subsequently lost 2–1 to Spain.

{{Expand section|date=November 2024}}
After disappointing results in [[UEFA Euro 2000]] and [[UEFA Euro 2004]] despite reaching the [[2002 FIFA World Cup final|2002 FIFA World Cup Final]], the [[Germany national football team]] reached the semi-finals in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and the finals in the [[UEFA Euro 2008]], losing to the eventual tournament winner both times. With [[Miroslav Klose]], [[Lukas Podolski]], [[Philipp Lahm]], [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] and [[Per Mertesacker]] playing a major role in these results already, it was the addition of [[Manuel Neuer]], [[Jérôme Boateng]], [[Mats Hummels]], [[Sami Khedira]], [[Mesut Özil]], [[Toni Kroos]], [[Mario Götze]] and [[Thomas Müller]] that pushed Germany to a top-tier world class team. Led by [[Joachim Löw]] the team finished in the top 4 in all major tournaments, additionally [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] winning their first world title after the [[German reunification]] in 1990 and reaching first place in the FIFA rankings for the first time after 20 years. Commentators mark their early group stage exit from the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] as the end of their ‘golden generation’ as well as Mesut Özil's retirement and Thomas Müller, Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels’ exclusion from the team although Müller and Hummels did return for [[UEFA Euro 2020]] in which Germany were knocked out in the [[UEFA Euro 2020 knockout stage|Round of 16]].

After the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] Spain began focusing on new skills and new techniques for the team. Spain began a winning streak from 2006 through 2009 along with the Spanish players this generation of players playing a unique brand of football at the time, with [[tiki-taka]] helping them dominate world football for years.

This golden generation was filled with players most notably including, [[Iker Casillas]], [[Xavi (footballer, born 1980)|Xavi]], [[Andrés Iniesta]], [[Sergio Ramos]], [[Carles Puyol]], [[Cesc Fàbregas]], [[Sergio Busquets]], [[David Villa]], [[Fernando Torres]], [[Gerard Piqué]], [[Xabi Alonso]] and [[David Silva]] helped [[Spain national football team|Spain]] win the [[UEFA European Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]], and the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], making them the first team ever to win the World Cup and both continental championships either side of it.

====Sweden (1948–1958)====
The late [[1940's]] and [[1950's]] was the golden era in [[Swedish football]] when the [[Sweden men's national football team]] achieved unprecedented results. They participated in two [[Fifa World Cup|World Cups]] and two [[Olympic Games]] and did win a medal every time, each time under English coach [[George Raynor]]. It started in [[1948 Summer Olympics]] when Sweden won every game and beat [[Yugoslavia men's national football team|Yugoslavia]] with 3–1 in the [[Football_at_the_1948_Summer_Olympics#Gold_medal_match|final]]. Striker [[Gunnar Nordahl]] was the tournament top scorer and was recruited by italian giants [[AC Milan]]. Nordahl was later joined by [[Gunnar Gren]] and [[Nils Liedholm]] where the trio was named [[Gre-No-Li]].

The [[Swedish FA]] had a strict amateur policy and did not allow professional players in the national team but Sweden still managed to end up with a bronze medal in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]]. After this more players from Sweden like [[Hasse Jeppson]], [[Karl-Erik Palmér]], [[Stig Sundqvist|Stig "Vittjärv" Sundqvist]] and [[Lennart Skoglund|Lennart "Nacka" Skoglund]] ended up in European clubs, mostly in [[Italy]]. [[1952 Summer Olympics]] resulted in a new bronze medal but without their top players, Sweden could not qualify for the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]]. 

Since Sweden was hosting the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]], the team was automatically qualified. After poor results ahead of the tournament, Swedish FA finally allowed professional players and the [[1958_FIFA_World_Cup_squads#Sweden|World Cup squad]] contained [[Nils Liedholm]], [[Kurt Hamrin]], [[Arne Selmosson]], [[Lennart Skoglund|Lennart "Nacka" Skoglund]] and [[Bengt Gustavsson|Bengt "Julle" Gustavsson]] along with former professional [[Gunnar Gren]]. The World Cup ended with a silver medal after a defeat against Brazil in the [[1958_FIFA_World_Cup_final|final game]]. Key players like [[Agne Simonsson]] and [[Orvar Bergmark]] was later sold abroad but this was the end of a golden era and [[Sweden]] did not participate in any championships during the [[1960's]].

====Yugoslavia (1987–1992)====
Yugoslavia's generation of young footballers won the [[1987 FIFA World Youth Championship]] and finished runner-up at the [[1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]]. The nation then reached the quarter-finals of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] and, a year later, a [[Red Star Belgrade]] team featuring many of the [[Yugoslavia national football team|national team]]'s stars became the first Yugoslav side to ever win the [[1990–91 European Cup|European Cup]]. Yugoslavia qualified for [[UEFA Euro 1992]] with seven wins from eight matches and the best goalscoring record and goal difference of any team during the [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying|qualifying phase]]. However, the team was disqualified prior to the tournament due to the [[Yugoslav Wars]] (it was replaced by the eventual champion, [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]) and did not play together again after the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|country's division]]. Several players from the Yugoslav team went on to finish in third place at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] with [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/soccer/world-cup-2010/writers/jonathan_wilson/07/01/yugoslavia.1990/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140618073243/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/soccer/world-cup-2010/writers/jonathan_wilson/07/01/yugoslavia.1990/|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 18, 2014|title=Osim recalls what might have been for a brilliant Yugoslavia in 1990|date=1 July 2010|access-date=18 June 2014|magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/england/2953134.stm|title=Serbia & Montenegro's new dawn|date=31 May 2003|access-date=18 June 2014|work=BBC}}</ref> This pre-dissolution golden generation in soccer was also mirrored by a golden generation of Yugoslav basketball that won the 1990 FIBA World Championship. Notable players from this generation include [[Alen Bokšić]], [[Robert Prosinečki]], [[Igor Štimac]], [[Robert Jarni]], [[Dejan Savićević]], [[Predrag Mijatović]], [[Siniša Mihajlović]], [[Davor Šuker]], [[Zvonimir Boban]] and [[Vladimir Jugović]].

==== Netherlands (1974–1978, 1988–1998) ====
{{Expand section|date=November 2024}}
The 1970s have been widely recognized as the peak of Dutch football, where the "[[Netherlands national football team|Oranje]]", led by [[Johan Cruyff]] had achieved remarkable success, making it into two back-to-back World Cup finals, where they faced West Germany in the [[World Cup 1974]] and Argentina in the [[World Cup 1978]], infamous for potential corruption and Argentinian government interference.

Whilst having good runs in the world cup, they also reached Semi-Finals in the [[Euro 1976]] edition. Aside from the team's "mastermind" Johan Cruyff, the Oranje also consisted of players, the likes of [[Piet Keizer]], [[Willem van Hanegem]], [[Johnny Rep]], [[Ruud Krol]], and [[Johan Neeskens]], as well as their tactically brilliant coach, [[Rinus Michels]], who played a key part into the Oranje's road to the final.

A new Golden Generation came about in the late 1980s, with attacking players like [[Marco Van Basten]], [[Ruud Gullit]], [[Wim Kieft]] & [[Gerald Vanenburg]]. They also had creative & hard working midfielders like [[Jan Wouters]], [[Frank Rijkaard]], [[Arnold Mühren]] & [[Erwin Koeman]]. They also had a solid defence with players like [[Sjaak Troost]], free-kick specialist [[Ronald Koeman]] and full-backs [[Berry van Aerle]] & [[Adri van Tiggelen]]. These players won the [[UEFA Euro 1988]] in style, playing exciting, attacking football all through the tournament.

==== Egypt (2006–2010) ====

[[Egypt national football team|Egypt]]'s Golden Generation won three consecutive [[Africa Cup of Nations]] and beat Ivory Coast's Golden Generation in the Final of the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]] and Algeria's Golden Generation in the semi-final of the [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations]], they also did one of the best performances in the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]] because they almost tied with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the opening match, won at the time World Champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] 1–0, and only losing to the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]. However, due to Egypt losing 1-0 in the tiebreaking play-off against Algeria,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Egypt versus Algeria: Inside the storm - CNN.com |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2009/SPORT/football/11/20/egypt.algeria.inside.story/ |access-date=2025-03-07 |website=CNN |language=en}}</ref> they failed to qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. Key players are [[Mohamed Aboutrika]], [[Essam El Hadary]], [[Gedo (footballer)|Gedo]], [[Hossam Hassan]], [[Mohamed Zidan]], and [[Ahmed Hassan (footballer, born 1975)|Ahmed Hassan]], this generation was led by [[Hassan Shehata]] who is considered to be the greatest [[Egypt national football team|Egyptian national football team]] manager.

==== Algeria (1980–1991; 2010–2014; 2019–2022) ====
The [[Algeria national football team|Algerian team]] of the 1980s has been dubbed the "golden generation", or the "first golden generation" of Algerian football. In fact, the team included the likes of [[Lakhdar Belloumi]], [[Rabah Madjer]], [[Tedj Bensaoula]], [[Mustapha Dahleb]], [[Ali Fergani]] and [[Mehdi Cerbah]], later joined by the likes of [[Moussa Saïb]] and [[Cherif Oudjani]]. 
This squad is mainly known for its first two appearances at the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. On its debut in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], they surprised everyone by beating reigning [[UEFA Euro 1980|European champions]] [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] 2–1. After a 0–2 loss against [[Austria national football team|Austria]], they won their second ever game against [[Chile national football team|Chile]]. However, the desert foxes would fail to qualify after Germany later beat Austria 1–0, in extremely dubious circumstances, in a game dubbed, the "[[Disgrace of Gijón]]".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_2006000/2006702.stm|title=1982: Algeria shock the world|work=bbc.com |date=27 May 2002 |access-date=20 February 2025 |archive-date=8 December 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241208065109/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_2006000/2006702.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> This game prompted [[FIFA]] to schedule the last group games of future World Cups at the same time to avoid any potential match-fixing case.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.algeria.com/blog/the-game-that-changed-the-world-cup-algeria |title=The Game that Changed the World Cup&nbsp;– Algeria |work=algeria.com |access-date=17 February 2025 |archive-date=10 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910220511/http://www.algeria.com/blog/the-game-that-changed-the-world-cup-algeria |url-status=live }}</ref>
Algeria appeared at the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|next World Cup]]. However, drawn in a tough group together with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]], they only managed to grab one point, a 1–1 draw against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]. On their second game, they held off [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian]] attackers until the 66th minute, the longest any team would manage at the tournament.
On the continental scene, Algeria reached the semifinals of 5 out of 6 [[Africa Cup of Nations|AFCONs]], winning the [[1990 African Cup of Nations|1990 edition]] on home soil against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], which had previously knocked them out in [[1980 African Cup of Nations|1980]] and [[1988 African Cup of Nations|1988]]. Their last achievement would be the [[1991 Afro-Asian Cup of Nations|1991 Afro-Asian Cup]] against [[Iran national football team|Iran]].

The team that reached the round of 16 of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] has been described as a golden generation or the "second golden generation" of Algerian football in reference to the side which reached the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] World Cups and won the [[1990 African Cup of Nations]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=7/news=lacen-this-golden-generation-has-matured-2393065.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701113342/http://www.fifa.com//worldcup/news/y=2014/m=7/news=lacen-this-golden-generation-has-matured-2393065.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 1, 2014|title=Lacen: This golden generation has matured|date=July 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://trueafrica.co/article/algerias-fennec-foxes-team-look-2017-african-cup-nations/|title=Is it Algeria's time to shine in the football world? – TRUE Africa|date=March 30, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2015/1/15/7517161/algeria-africa-cup-of-nations-2015|title=After their World Cup heroics, all eyes will be on Algeria at AFCON|date=15 January 2015}}</ref> Key players in the 2010–2014 period included [[Madjid Bougherra]], [[Mehdi Lacen]], [[Djamel Mesbah]], [[Hassan Yebda]], [[Sofiane Feghouli]], [[Islam Slimani]], [[Yacine Brahimi]] and [[Raïs M'Bolhi]]. After a tumultuous period which saw the team fail to qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|a second consecutive World Cup]] and even fail to progress from the [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations|2017 AFCON]] group stages, Algeria, now with [[Djamel Belmadi]] at the helm, and with players such as [[Riyad Mahrez]], [[Ismaël Bennacer]], [[Youcef Belaïli]] and [[Baghdad Bounedjah]], won the [[2019 Africa Cup of Nations]].

==== Ivory Coast (2006–2015) ====
{{Expand section|date=November 2024}}
Despite winning the 1992 edition of the [[Africa Cup of Nations]], the country saw an outpour of talent during the first half of the 2000s (decade). The majority of this generation consisted of talented players who enjoyed considerable success in Europe. Led by [[Didier Drogba]] (who is also the national team's highest ever goalscorer), several other players found contracts in the biggest football stages in the world, such as brothers [[Yaya Touré|Yaya]] and [[Kolo Touré]], [[Didier Zokora]], [[Emmanuel Eboué]], [[Cheick Tioté]], [[Gervinho]] and [[Salomon Kalou]]. During this period, [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] managed its first [[FIFA World Cup]] appearances in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/ivory-coast-les-elephants-world-cup-2014-barzil-didier-drogba-yaya-toure/|title=Last hurrah for Ivory Coast's Golden Generation|date=26 May 2014|access-date=29 May 2014|work=Sportsnet}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/ivory-coast/10589548/World-Cup-2014-Time-for-Ivory-Coasts-ageing-golden-generation-to-finally-make-an-impact-on-the-world-stage.html|title=World Cup 2014: Time for Ivory Coast's ageing golden generation to finally make an impact on the world stage|date=22 January 2014|access-date=29 May 2014|work=The Telegraph}}</ref> They also won the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations|Africa Cup of Nations]] in 2015, as well as, reaching the finals in [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|2006]] and [[2012 Africa Cup of Nations|2012]].

==== Brazil (1958–1970, 1994–2006) ====
For the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]], Brazil were drawn in a group with [[England national football team|England]], the [[Soviet Union national football team|USSR]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. They beat [[Austria national football team|Austria]] 3–0 in their first match, then drew 0–0 with [[England national football team|England]]. Before the match, coach [[Vicente Feola]] made three substitutions that were crucial for Brazil to defeat the Soviets: [[Zito (footballer, born 1932)|Zito]], [[Garrincha]] and [[Pelé]]. From the kick-off, they kept up the pressure relentlessly, and after three minutes, which were later described as "the greatest three minutes in the history of football", [[Vavá]] gave Brazil the lead. They won the match by 2–0. Pelé scored the only goal of their quarter-final match against [[Wales national football team|Wales]], and they beat [[France national football team|France]] 5–2 in the semi-final. Brazil then beat [[Sweden men's national football team|Sweden]] 5–2 in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup final|final]], winning their first World Cup and becoming the first nation to win a World Cup title outside of its own continent. Pelé described it tearfully as a nation coming of age. In the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]], Brazil earned its second title with Garrincha as the star player, a mantle and responsibility laid upon him after the regular talisman, Pelé, was injured during the second group match against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] and unable to play for the rest of the tournament. Brazil won its third World Cup in Mexico in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]]. It fielded what has been widely considered the best World Cup football squad ever, led by Pelé in his last World Cup finals, captain [[Carlos Alberto Torres]], [[Jairzinho]], [[Tostão]], [[Gérson]] and [[Rivellino]]. Even though Garrincha had retired, this team was still a force to be reckoned with. They won all six of their games—against Czechoslovakia, England and [[Romania national football team|Romania]] during group play, and against [[Peru national football team|Peru]], Uruguay and Italy in the knockout rounds. Jairzinho was the second top scorer with seven goals, and is the only player to score in every match in a World Cup; Pelé finished with four goals.

From 1997 onwards, Brazil re-established themselves as one of the best football teams in the world after winning the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], beating [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup final|final]] on [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]], with [[Roberto Baggio]] missing the deciding spot-kick marking Brazil return as one of the best sides in the world and champions for the first time in 24 years led by [[Romário|Romario]], [[Bebeto]], [[Dunga]] and [[Cláudio Taffarel|Claudio Taffarel]]. They then proceeded to reach the [[1995 Copa América final|final]] of the [[1995 Copa América|1995 Copa America]] only to lose to [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] on penalties and then reached the [[1998 FIFA World Cup final|1998 World Cup final]] and then proceeded to lose 3–0 to [[France national football team|France]], led by a dominant display from [[Zinedine Zidane]], with [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] being named player of the tournament with 4 goals and 3 assists. In 1997, they [[1997 Copa América|won]] the Copa America beating Bolivia 3–1 in the [[1997 Copa América final|final]] and 1999, retained their title defeating Uruguay 3–0 in the [[1999 Copa América final|final]] with both [[Rivaldo]] and Ronaldo scoring each being top scorers of the tournament with 5 goals and Rivaldo winning player of the tournament. 2002 is commonly considered the peak of the national team as they won every game en route to victory at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] with the 3R's ([[Ronaldinho]], Ronaldo and Rivaldo who scored 2, 8 and 4 goals respectively) carrying them to the trophy. They started by defeating Turkey, Costa Rica and China in the group stages, Belgium, England and Turkey again in the round of 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively before defeating [[Germany national football team|Germany]] 2–0 in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup final|final]] where Ronaldo scored 2 goals past [[Oliver Kahn]], cementing themselves as one of the most dominant teams in football. Ronaldo was top scorer with 8 goals. They then won the Copa America in 2004 and then in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], they were then knocked out by France in the quarter-finals with a goal from [[Thierry Henry]]. They won the Copa America again in [[2007 Copa América|2007]], but the quality of players paled in comparison to the superstars between 1998 and 2006. Key players from this generation include Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho, [[Kaká|Kaka]], [[Roberto Carlos]], [[Cafu]], [[Lúcio|Lucio]], [[Zé Roberto]], [[Gilberto Silva]], [[Dida (footballer, born 1973)|Dida]], [[Adriano (footballer, born February 1982)|Adriano]] and [[Robinho]]. Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo and Kaka have all won the [[Ballon d'Or|Ballon D'or]].

==== Uruguay (2010–2014) ====
In 2010, however, a new generation of footballers, led by [[Luis Suárez]], [[Diego Forlán]] and [[Edinson Cavani]], formed a team considered to be Uruguay's best in the last four decades, catching international attention after finishing fourth in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]. Uruguay opened the tournament with a goalless draw against France, followed by defeats of South Africa (3–0) in and Mexico (1–0) respectively, finishing at the top of their group with seven points. In the second round, they played South Korea, defeating them 2–1 with star striker Luis Suárez scoring a brace and earning Uruguay a spot in the quarter-finals for the first time since 1970. Against Ghana, the match finished 1–1, forcing the game into extra-time. Both sides had their chances at extra time but Suárez blocked the ball with his hand in the penalty area, earning Suárez a red card and earning Uruguay universal scorn. Ghana striker [[Asamoah Gyan]] missed the subsequent penalty, forcing the game to go into penalties where Uruguay would win 4–2, sending them into the last four. They played the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the semi-finals but were beaten 3–2. For the third-place match, they played Germany, again losing 3–2. This placed Uruguay in fourth place for the tournament, their best result in 40 years. Diego Forlan was awarded the Player of The Tournament.

A year later, they won the [[2011 Copa América|Copa America]] for the first time in 16 years and broke the record for the most successful team in South America. Luis Suárez ended up as the Player of The Tournament. In the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] Uruguay was placed in Group D alongside [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], [[England national football team|England]], and [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. They were upset by Costa Rica in the opening match, losing 3–1 despite taking the lead in the first half. They rebounded with a 2–1 victory over England, in which Suárez scored a brace right after coming back from an injury, and a 1–0 victory over Italy, placing them second in their group and earning a spot in the last 16. During the match against Italy, forward Luis Suárez [[List of 2014 FIFA World Cup controversies#Uruguay vs Italy|bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini on his left shoulder]]. Two days after the match, the [[FIFA Disciplinary Code|FIFA Disciplinary Committee]] banned Suárez for nine international matches, the longest such ban in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban handed to Italy's [[Mauro Tassotti]] for breaking the nose of Spain's [[Luis Enrique (footballer)|Luis Enrique]] in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. Suárez was also banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months and fined [[Swiss franc|CHF]]100,000 (approx. £65,700/€82,000/US$119,000). In the round of 16, Uruguay played Colombia but were beaten 2–0, eliminating them from the tournament.

==== Argentina (1978–1982, 1986–1994, 2019–present) ====
{{Expand section|date=November 2024}}
After the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], in which [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] were eliminated in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|round of 16]] and sacked boss [[Jorge Sampaoli]], [[Lionel Scaloni]] was hired and reached the semi-finals of the [[Copa América|Copa America]] in [[2019 Copa América|2019]] before winning it in [[2021 Copa América|2021]] and [[2024 Copa América|2024]]. Between 2019 and 2022, Argentina went on the second longest international unbeaten streak in history of 36 matches but the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] showed how much the Argentinian squad have improved by winning it. This core of players consisted of [[Lionel Messi]], [[Ángel Di María|Angel Di Maria]], [[Rodrigo De Paul]], [[Lautaro Martinez]], [[Emiliano Martínez|Emiliano Martinez]], [[Nahuel Molina]], [[Marcos Acuña|Marcos Acuna]], [[Nicolás Otamendi|Nicolas Otamendi]], [[Paulo Dybala]], [[Cristian Romero (Argentine footballer)|Cristian Romero]], [[Leandro Paredes]], and later [[Alexis Mac Allister]], [[Julián Álvarez|Julian Alvarez]], and [[Enzo Fernández|Enzo Fernandez]].

{{Expand section|date=November 2024}}
The backbone of the Chile team which won back to back Copa América titles in [[2015 Copa América|2015]] and in [[Copa América Centenario|2016]] came from the U-20 squad that finished third at the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in [[Canada]] (most notably [[Alexis Sánchez]] and [[Arturo Vidal]]). However, in 2017, they finished runners-up to [[Germany national football team|Germany]]'s B team at the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup|Confederations Cup]] and then inexplicably failed to qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]], despite most of the squad being in the prime of their careers, following unexpected losses to [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|qualification]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://remezcla.com/sports/chile-golden-generation-world-cup/|title=Chile's Golden Generation is over, as la Roja Fails to Qualify for the 2018 World Cup|date=11 October 2017}}</ref> Other notable players during this period include [[Claudio Bravo]], [[Eduardo Vargas]], [[Mark Gonzalez]], [[Mauricio Isla]], [[Jean Beausejour]], [[Gary Medel]], [[Charles Aránguiz]] and [[Gonzalo Jara (footballer, born 1985)|Gonzalo Jara]].

The golden generation of Canada's national team has been marked by the arrival of a generation of new young players, led by the first Canadian [[UEFA Champions League]] winner [[Alphonso Davies]] of [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], the most expensive Canadian soccer player in history, as well as [[Jonathan David]], who joined [[Lille OSC|Lille]] for €30 million in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|date=August 23, 2020|title=Alphonso Davies wins UEFA Champions League title with Bayern|url=https://theprovince.com/sports/soccer/international-soccer/alphonso-davies-wins-uefa-champions-league-title|access-date=August 31, 2021|website=The Province|language=en-CA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Rouse|first=Daniel|date=August 11, 2020|title=Lille make Jonathan David most expensive Canadian player ever|url=https://www.thescore.com/fra_fed/news/2000631|access-date=August 31, 2021|website=theScore.com|language=en}}</ref> Other key players include [[Tajon Buchanan]], the first ever Canadian international to play, and win, in [[Serie A]] with [[Inter Milan]], [[Stephen Eustáquio]], [[Ismaël Koné]] and [[Cyle Larin]], the highest scoring Canadian player in [[La Liga]].

In 2017, the [[Canadian Premier League]] was founded, the first fully professional soccer league in the country.

Canada ended 2021 40th in the [[FIFA Men's World Ranking|FIFA World Rankings]], its highest-ever position at the time, and earning the honour of "Most Improved Side" after having started the year 72nd. On February 10, 2022, Canada moved up to 33rd in the rankings.

On March 27, 2022, Canada finished top of the final qualification group in CONCACAF with the most goals scored and the fewest goals conceded, qualifying for its first [[2022 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in 36 years.

In 2024, Canada qualified for its first-ever [[2024 Copa América|Copa America]]. After finishing second in the group stages ahead of Peru and Chile, Canada won its quarter-final match against Venezuela on penalties. After losing to Argentina in the semi-finals, Canada faced Uruguay in the 3rd and 4th place match. Despite Canada leading the match, Uruguay managed to equalize in the 92nd minute and eventually won on penalties.

===Croatia (1994-1996)===
Croatia's first golden generation in handball emerged in the 1990s following [[Independence of Croatia|Croatia's independence from Yugoslavia in 1991]], highlighted by their bronze medal at the [[1994 European Men's Handball Championship|1994 European Championship]] and silver medal at the [[1995 World Men's Handball Championship|1995 World Championship]]. Their crowning achievement was the gold medal at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics in Atlanta]]. This period was defined by a core group of players, including many who had previously played for the [[Yugoslavia men's national handball team|Yugoslavian national team]], and was cemented by coaches [[Zdravko Zovko]] and [[Velimir Kljaić]] and key players like [[Slavko Goluža]], [[Zlatko Saračević]], [[Patrik Ćavar]], [[Alvaro Načinović]] and [[Goran Perkovac]].

===Croatia (2003-2010)===
Croatia's second golden generation in handball emerged in the early 2000's following Croatia's seven year massive decline after winning the gold medal at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics in Atlanta]], the team was taken over by a known Croatian coach [[Lino Červar]] after their worst ever performance at the international scene in 2002 and in the span of 18 months they went from being the worst ranked team at the [[2002 European Men's Handball Championship|2002 European Championship]] to being [[2003 World Men's Handball Championship|World Champions (2003)]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics|Olympic Winners (2004)]]. They finished fourth at the European Championship in [[2004 European Men's Handball Championship|2004]] and [[2006 European Men's Handball Championship|2006]] and the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics in Peking]]. The weakest result of this era was fifth ranked place at the [[2007 World Men's Handball Championship|2007 World Championship in Germany]]. Combined with two gold medals, under Lino Červar they played four more finals ([[2005 World Men's Handball Championship|2005]], [[2008 European Men's Handball Championship|2008]], [[2009 World Men's Handball Championship|2009]], [[2010 European Men's Handball Championship|2010]]) losing all four to Spain, Denmark and their biggest ever rivals France twice. [[Lino Červar]] stepped down as the coach following third consecutive loss at the [[2010 European Men's Handball Championship|2010 European Championship final]], he was replaced by his assistant coach and former Croatian captain [[Slavko Goluža]]. The era is defined by legendary players like [[Ivano Balić]], one of the world's best players, and features a squad that included many prominent athletes such as [[Slavko Goluža]], [[Igor Vori]], [[Blaženko Lacković]], [[Denis Špoljarić]], [[Mirza Džomba]], [[Goran Šprem]], [[Petar Metličić]] and [[Vlado Šola]]. In the later years following retirements of many experienced and older players, younger players started to arrive on the scene who had a big impact in upcoming years such as [[Domagoj Duvnjak]], who'd later become one of the world's best players, [[Ivan Čupić]], [[Zlatko Horvat]], [[Marko Kopljar]], [[Manuel Štrlek]] and [[Mirko Alilović]].
