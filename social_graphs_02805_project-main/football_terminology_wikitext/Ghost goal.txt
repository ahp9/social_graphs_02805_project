{{short description|Goal wrongly awarded or not given in association football}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2019}}
In [[association football]], a '''ghost goal''' (or '''phantom goal''') is either a goal wrongly awarded despite the ball not having crossed the [[Goal line (football)|goal line]], or a goal wrongly not given despite the ball having crossed the line. In an attempt to combat ghost goals, rules allowing [[goal-line technology]] (GLT) were passed by the [[International Football Association Board]] in 2012 and have consequently been introduced for some football competitions, including the [[FIFA World Cup]], [[FIFA Club World Cup]] and [[Premier League]]. The [[video assistant referee]] (VAR), introduced in 2018, provides an alternative system to GLT, and is cheaper to introduce and operate than the FIFA qualified GLT systems.

==Etymology==
In Germany, the term "''Phantomtor''" usually refers to a [[Bundesliga]] "goal" awarded to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] player [[Thomas Helmer]] in April 1994 against [[1. FC Nürnberg]], as his team scraped to a 2–1 victory.<ref name="Phantom"/> It was an error of judgement by the match officials, as the ball missed the goal and instead went over the byline. The "goal" had direct implications on the outcome of the competition at both ends of the table — had the ''Phantomtor'' not stood and the match finished 1–1, Bayern Munich would have ultimately lost out on the league title on goal difference and Nürnberg would have survived relegation by one point — and led to an official objection by [[FIFA]] because the [[German Football Association]] ordered the result to be annulled and the game to be replayed. A re-match eventually took place and Bayern Munich ran out 5–0 winners.<ref name="Phantom">{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/87/germany/2010/11/08/2204177/germany-unity-series-thomas-helmers-goal-that-never-was|title=Germany Unity Series: Thomas Helmer's Goal That Never Was|work=Goal.com|date=8 November 2010}}</ref>

The term "ghost goal" in the English language arose from a quote by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] manager [[José Mourinho]], following a [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League knockout stage#Liverpool v Chelsea|2005 Champions League semi-final second leg]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], ultimately decided by a single goal by [[Luis García (footballer, born 1978)|Luis García]], awarded by referee [[Ľuboš Micheľ]], but dubbed a "ghost goal" and described as "a goal that came from the moon" by Mourinho.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/4392444.stm|title=The world according to Mourinho|work=BBC Sport|date=31 October 2005}}</ref> Television replays were inconclusive as to whether the ball crossed the line or not. Micheľ said that his decision was based on the reaction of the assistant referee, who signalled that the ball had indeed crossed over the line, but had he not awarded Liverpool the goal, he would have awarded them a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] and sent off Chelsea goalkeeper [[Petr Čech]] for a foul on [[Milan Baroš]] instead.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-06-28 |title=What is a 'ghost goal'?

===Crystal Palace v Coventry City, 1980–81 League Division One===
In 1980, [[Clive Allen]] shot a free kick for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], after which the ball rebounded off the stanchion but the referee disallowed the goal as he thought it had just hit the outside of the stanchion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=82&story=6439|title=On this day in 1980: Allen's ghost goal|last=www.holmesdale.net|first=Holmesdale Online|website=Holmesdale Online|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> This was shown on ''[[Match of the Day]]'' on BBC television when it was then transmitted on Sunday afternoons.

===Partick Thistle v Dundee United, 1992–93 Scottish Premier Division===
In a 1993 [[Scottish Premier Division]] match between [[Partick Thistle]] and [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] at [[Firhill Stadium|Firhill]], the ball entered the goal and bounced back from the supporting stanchion after a close-range shot by [[Paddy Connolly]]. Despite Partick defender [[Martin Clark (footballer, born 1968)|Martin Clark]] catching the ball and handing it to goalkeeper [[Andy Murdoch (footballer, born 1968)|Andy Murdoch]], referee [[Les Mottram]] failed to award the goal or penalise the handball and waved play on.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/2014/01/30/dundee-united-legend-looks-back-on-the-goal-that-never-was/#r3z-addoor|title=Dundee United legend looks back on the goal that never was|publisher=BBC Sport|date=30 January 2014|accessdate=3 September 2018|archive-date=3 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903215328/https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/2014/01/30/dundee-united-legend-looks-back-on-the-goal-that-never-was/#r3z-addoor|url-status=dead}}</ref> Dundee United still won 4–0, and Mottram went on to officiate in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]].

===Tottenham Hotspur v Manchester United, 2004–05 Premier League===
A few months before the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League]] semi-final between Chelsea and Liverpool which led to the term "ghost goal" entering the lexicon, [[Pedro Mendes (footballer, born 1979)|Pedro Mendes]] of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] caught [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s goalkeeper [[Roy Carroll]] off his line with a shot from 55 yards out, in the 89th minute of a [[Premier League]] match on 4 January 2005. Carroll attempted to catch the ball but spilled it over his shoulder and a few yards over the goal line, before he scooped the ball back into the playing area. Referee [[Mark Clattenburg]] and his officials were unable to determine whether the ball had crossed the line and the game finished goalless.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4143131.stm |title=Linesman defends disallowed goal|work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=5 January 2005 |access-date=11 July 2007}}</ref>

Referee [[Stuart Attwell]] awarded a goal to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in an English [[EFL Championship|Championship]] match in September 2008, although the ball had passed wide of the goal, so that his assistant should have awarded a corner kick; the match finished 2–2.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jacob |first1=Gary |last2=Solhekol |first2=Kaveh |last3=Szczepanik |first3=Nick |date=September 24, 2008 |title=Attwell given different role |url= |newspaper=[[The Times]] |department=The Sweeper |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited / NI Syndication Limited |page=75 |publication-place=London, England |issue=69437 |issn=0140-0460 |id={{Gale|A185474744|IF0503739124}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/7614022.stm |title=Watford 2–2 Reading |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=20 September 2008 |access-date=6 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Biggs|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/championship/3180685/Ghost-goal-referee-Stuart-Attwell-is-set-for-promotion-to-international-duty.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015045104/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/championship/3180685/Ghost-goal-referee-Stuart-Attwell-is-set-for-promotion-to-international-duty.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 October 2008|title='Ghost goal' referee Stuart Attwell is set for promotion to international duty|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=11 October 2008 |accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref> A similar incident happened in a [[2. Bundesliga]] match between [[MSV Duisburg]] and [[FSV Frankfurt]], when [[Christian Tiffert]] took a shot that hit the crossbar and landed 1.5 metres outside of the goal-line, yet was still awarded as a goal.

===Crystal Palace v Bristol City, 2009–10 EFL Championship===
Conversely, during an English Championship game in August 2009, [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]'s [[Freddie Sears]] put the ball in the net, hitting the [[stanchion]] at the back of the goal and bouncing out. A goal was not awarded.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dominic|last=Fifield|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/aug/17/crystal-palace-replay-neil-warnock|title=Crystal Palace's ghost goal|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 August 2009}}</ref> This was very similar to the incident that had occurred for Crystal Palace's Clive Allen almost 30 years earlier.

===Bolton Wanderers v Queens Park Rangers, 2011–12 Premier League===
Another incident in England came in a Premier League game between [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on 10 March 2012, when QPR's [[Clint Hill (footballer)|Clint Hill]] headed the ball in from close range. The ball crossed the line by a couple of feet before goalkeeper [[Ádám Bogdán]] was able to palm it onto the crossbar and out. [[The Football Association]] (FA) subsequently called for [[goal-line technology]] to be implemented as soon as possible. The corner which led to the goal had in fact been wrongly awarded, and should have been a Bolton goal kick, meaning two bad decisions "evened themselves out".<ref>{{cite news|first=Marc|last=Iles|url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/9584259.MATCH_VERDICT__Bolton_Wanderers_2_QPR_1/|title=MATCH VERDICT: Bolton Wanderers 2 QPR 1|work=The Bolton News|date=12 March 2012}}</ref>

===AC Milan v Juventus, 2011–12 Serie A===
On 25 February 2012, with [[A.C.

===Chelsea v Tottenham Hotspur, 2011–12 FA Cup===
On 15 April 2012, in Chelsea's [[2011–12 FA Cup|FA Cup semi-final]] against Tottenham Hotspur, referee [[Martin Atkinson]] awarded Chelsea a goal resulting from a 49th-minute shot by [[Juan Mata]].

===Wrexham v Kidderminster Harriers, 2013–14 Conference Premier===
On 16 November 2013, Adrian Cieslewicz of [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] was involved in a situation of this kind. With Wrexham down 2–0 at [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] in a [[Conference Premier]] game, Cieslewicz burst into the penalty area and appeared to slot the ball into the bottom corner of the net. However, the ball had actually squeezed through a hole in the net, and referee Amy Fearn originally disallowed the goal. After six minutes of consultation, with her assistants amidst protests from the Wrexham players, the goal was awarded. However, Kidderminster took advantage of the delay in the match and scored to make it 3–1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wrexhamfan.wordpress.com/2013/11/16/adrian-cieslewiczs-ghost-goal/ |date=16 November 2013|title=Adrian Cieslewicz's Ghost Goal! |publisher=WrexhamFan |accessdate=13 December 2016}}</ref>

===Ireland v Scotland in the British Home Championship 1892===
An early ghost goal decided a [[British Home Championship]] match between [[Ireland national football team (1882–1950)|Ireland]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in 1892. 
Goal nets were in use, precisely to aid the judgement of when a goal had been scored, but were still an experimental innovation, and confusion was caused when a Scotland shot went wide of the post, but the ball came to rest against the net and an Irish defender brought it inside the goal area to restart play. The referee, who had a poor view of the shot itself, assumed a goal had been scored and duly awarded what turned out to be the winner in a 3–2 result. The referee required protection from the angry supporters at full time.<ref>[https://www.londonhearts.com/scores/images/1892/1892031923.htm The Referee's Note Book], The Scottish Referee, 21 March 1892.

===1966 FIFA World Cup Final===
{{main article|1966 FIFA World Cup final}}
[[File:England vs germany hurst heads to goal.jpg|thumb|Geoff Hurst heading for England's first goal during the 1966 FIFA World Cup final]]
In the [[1966 FIFA World Cup final]] played in London's original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] between [[England national football team|England]] and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], 11 minutes of extra-time had elapsed and the score was level at 2–2. [[Alan Ball Jr.|Alan Ball]] put in a cross to England striker [[Geoff Hurst]], who swivelled and shot from close range. The ball hit the underside of the crossbar bouncing down towards the line and bounced off the ground before being cleared away by West Germany's defenders.

The England players celebrated a goal, but referee [[Gottfried Dienst]] was uncertain if they had indeed scored. He consulted his [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant]], [[Tofik Bahramov|Tofiq Bahramov]]; after a brief conversation in broken English, the Swiss referee awarded the goal to the home team. The crowd and the audience of 400&nbsp;million television viewers were left unsure whether the ball had crossed the line and whether the goal should have been given or not. England went on to win the match 4–2 and secure their first FIFA World Cup and only trophy so far.

[[Scoring in association football|Goals in association football]] are awarded when "the whole of the ball passes over the goal line".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws10_01.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041016223156/http://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws10_01.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 October 2004|title=Laws of the Game|work=FIFA}}</ref> German players claimed to have seen chalk dust, which would indicate it was not a goal and that the ball had merely bounced on the goal-line. Those who consider that the linesman made the correct decision cite the good position of the linesman and the statement of [[Roger Hunt]], the nearest England player to the ball, who claimed he saw the ball bounce over the line, and therefore wheeled away in celebration rather than attempting to tap the rebounding ball in.

When Bahramov wrote his memoirs, he stated that he believed the ball had bounced back, not from the crossbar, but from the net, so the further movement of the ball was already insignificant, and not visible for him either so it did not matter where the ball hit the ground anyway.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Referee Dienst did not see the scene. Commentators such as Robert Becker of ''[[Kicker (Sports magazine)|Kicker]]'' magazine accused the assistant of [[bias]] because the German team had eliminated the Soviets in the semi-final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/YZYY7V,4,0,Die_Geschichte_der_FIFAFu%DFballweltmeisterschaft.html|publisher=Bundescentral für politische Bildung|title=Die Geschichte der FIFA-Fußballweltmeisterschaft|date=4 May 2006 |accessdate=30 May 2006|language=German}}</ref>

In England, Bahramov became known as "the Russian linesman", as Azerbaijan was part of the Soviet Union at the time. Bahramov also became famous in his home land: Azerbaijan's [[Tofiq Bahramov Stadium|national football stadium]] was named after him and a statue was built. When England played the [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan national team]] in a [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 6|FIFA World Cup qualifier in October 2004]]—in the stadium named after Bahramov—many England fans travelling to the game asked to be shown the grave of the official, who had died in 1993, so that they could place flowers on it, and before the match a ceremony honouring him was attended by Hurst and other footballing celebrities.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3740556.stm|title=Baku memorial for 1966 linesman|work=BBC News|date=13 October 2004|access-date=29 May 2006}}</ref> In Germany, it led to the creation of the expression '''''Wembley-Tor''''' ("'''Wembley goal'''"), a phrase used to describe any shot that hits the crossbar, bounces on the ground and spins back into the penalty area.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Tom |title=Do You Speak Football?: A Glossary of Football Words and Phrases from Around the World |date=2018 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |page=114}}</ref>

A study conducted by the engineering department at [[Oxford University]] concluded the ball did not cross the line entirely and that it was at least {{cvt|6|cm||||}} away from being a goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/papers/reid96.pdf|title=Goal-directed Video Metrology|accessdate=13 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302225512/http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/papers/reid96.pdf|archive-date=2 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

There exists colour footage of Hurst's goal, taken from another angle by an amateur cameraman situated in the stands and having a view almost parallel to the English goal line. This film material appears to show that the ball did not cross the goal-line in full.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeXWEVXhdUo|title=Youtube Video of the 1966 Wembley Goal, filmed from another angle|website=[[YouTube]] |date=27 June 2008 |accessdate= 13 June 2011}}</ref>

=== Panama v Costa Rica in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier ===
On 10 October 2017, [[Panama national football team|Panama]] hosted [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] in the final round of [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – CONCACAF fifth round|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]]. [[Johan Venegas]] opened the scoring for Costa Rica, before [[Gabriel Torres]] headed the ball against the goal line. The ball did not cross the line, but referee [[Walter López Castellanos|Walter López]] awarded a goal for Panama to level the match. In the 88th minute, [[Román Torres]] scored for Panama to win the match, eliminating the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and condemning [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] to the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF–AFC play-off)|CONCACAF-AFC play-off]] against [[Australia men's national soccer team|Australia]]. If Gabriel Torres' goal was not given, Panama would have failed to qualify for the tournament, with Honduras automatically qualifying and the United States advancing to the intercontinental play-off. American press outlets speculated that [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] would appeal against Panama's ghost goal to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-10-11 |title=Can the U.S. appeal controversial Panama goal that left them out of World Cup? |url=https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/can-the-u-s-appeal-controversial-panama-goal-that-left-them-out-of-world-cup/ |access-date=2024-11-05 |website=CBSSports.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-10-11 |title=Phantom goal aids Panama and dooms U.S. |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37535484/phantom-goal-helps-panama-beat-costa-rica-helps-doom-usmnt |access-date=2024-11-05 |website=ESPN.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Lauletta |first=Tyler |title=A phantom goal that helped knock the United States out of the World Cup never should have counted |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/usmnt-eliminated-panama-phantom-goal-2017-10 |access-date=2024-11-05 |website=Business Insider |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kerr-Dineen |first=Luke |title=The 'phantom goal' that robbed the USMNT |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ftw/2017/10/11/breaking-down-the-phantom-goal-that-robbed-the-usmnt-of-its-final-world-cup-chance/106519244/ |access-date=2024-11-05 |website=USA TODAY |language=en-US}}</ref> However, Michael Kammarman, the federation's press officer,  stated "As far as I know there is no recourse.

=== Serbia v Portugal in 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifier ===
On 27 March 2021, [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] were playing [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] in a [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|FIFA World Cup qualifying]] match at the [[Red Star Stadium|Rajko Mitic Stadium]]. After 90 minutes and with the score tied at 2–2, Portugal's [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] scored what appeared to be a winning goal in stoppage time; the ball rolled into the post and crossed the line just before being kicked away by Serbia captain [[Dušan Tadić]]. Despite replays clearly showing the ball completely crossing the line, there was no [[goal-line technology]] or [[video assistant referee]] present in the match, and the referee did not award a goal, which infuriated Ronaldo and prompted him to take off his [[Captain (association football)|captain's armband]] in anger.<ref>{{Citation|title=Cristiano Ronaldo victory goal vs Serbia who stolen referee|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEuFzsbt-XM|access-date=27 January 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=27 March 2021|title=Serbia 2-2 Portugal: Cristiano Ronaldo has last-gasp goal controversially denied in qualifier|url=https://www.eurosport.com/football/world-cup-qualification-uefa/2022/serbia-2-2-portugal-cristiano-ronaldo-has-last-gasp-finish-controversially-denied-in-qualifier_sto8194346/story.shtml|access-date=27 January 2022|website=Eurosport}}</ref> The match finished 2–2 and Serbia would eventually go on to finish top of Group A and qualify directly for the tournament by beating the same Portuguese team in [[Lisbon]],<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-11-14 |title=Portugal 1-2 Serbia: Drama in Lisbon as late Aleksandar Mitrovic header sees Serbs leapfrog opponents to World Cup spot |url=https://www.eurosport.com/football/world-cup-qualification-uefa/2022/world-cup-qualifying-live-portugal-v-serbia_sto8621578/story.shtml |access-date=2023-11-19 |website=Eurosport |language=en}}</ref> whilst Portugal had to go through the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA second round|March 2022 play-offs]] in order to seal their ticket to [[2022 FIFA World Cup|Qatar]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Ramsay |first=George |date=November 14, 2022 |title=Portugal faces playoff to reach 2022 World Cup after being stunned by Serbia's late goal |url=https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/15/football/portugal-serbia-world-cup-qualifiers-spt-intl/index.html |access-date=27 January 2022 |website=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=FIFA World Cup 2022 Qualifiers: Serbia Shock Portugal To Qualify Alongside Spain, Croatia|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/sports-news-fifa-world-cup-2022-qualifiers-serbia-shock-portugal-to-qualify-alongside-spain-croatia/401001|access-date=27 January 2022|website=Outlook India|date=15 November 2021 }}</ref>

===Italy vs France in the 2023 Under-21 UEFA European Championship===
In the [[2023 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]] were playing [[France national football team|France]] in the first game of the group. In the 92nd minute, with France leading 2–1, Italy's [[Raoul Bellanova]] scored a header, which was blocked by a French defender clearly over the line. However, due to the absence of [[Goal Line Technology]], the goal was not awarded. Considering the results of subsequent matches, if the goal had been awarded (making the result 2–2), France would have won the group regardless, while Italy would have advanced to the knockout stage as runners-up, instead of finishing third and therefore knocked out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/it/liste/polemiche-francia-italia-under-21-segna-bellanova-goal-line-technology-non-c-e/bltc51bf6f532cfb2d1|title=Polemiche in Francia-Italia Under 21: segna Bellanova, ma la Goal Line Technology non c'è|date=21 June 2023|language=it}}</ref>
