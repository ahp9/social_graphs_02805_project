"'''2–0 lead is the worst lead'''" is a [[cliché]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/proof-dangerous-lead/story?id=23820288|title=Proof 2-0 is a most dangerous lead|date=22 May 2014|website=ABC News|access-date=9 December 2016}}</ref> used in [[sport]]ing contests,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/the_worst_lead_in_hockey_is_a_two_goal_lead|title=The worst lead in hockey is a two-goal lead|last=Popik|first=Barry|website=Barrypopik.com|access-date=9 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/4-reasons-why-2-0-lead-ice-hockeys-worst-aguilar-eli-mp-cpds|title=4 Reasons Why a 2-0 Lead is Ice Hockey's Worst Lead|date=9 December 2016|website=LinkedIn}}</ref> to describe the situation in which one team is leading by a score of 2–0, causing them to become complacent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.goalden.com/2010/06/20-the-most-dangerous-score-in-the-game/|title=2:0 - TheNH most dangerous score in the game|date=10 June 2010|website=Goalden|access-date=9 December 2016|archive-date=20 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220073952/http://www.goalden.com/2010/06/20-the-most-dangerous-score-in-the-game/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The phrase is most common in [[association football]], where it is sometimes applied only to the scoreline at [[half-time]]. It is sometimes also encountered in other sports where 2–0 is a moderately large lead, such as [[ice hockey]].

==Concept==
The underlying concept is that, a team which is leading 2–0 will be complacent<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kicker-conspiracy.blogspot.com/2007/06/most-dangerous-lead.html|title=Kicker Conspiracy: The most dangerous lead|last=M|first=Alex|date=22 June 2007|website=Kicker Conspiracy|access-date=9 December 2016}}</ref> and have a 'false sense of security' in their lead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.impactmontreal.com/en/post/2015/04/03/2-0-clich%C3%A9-goes-most-dangerous-scoreline|title=2–0, the cliché goes, is the most dangerous scoreline|date=9 December 2016|website=Montreal Impact}}</ref> If the trailing team then scores to make it 2–1, the leading team can panic and concede further, resulting in a [[Tie (draw)|draw]], or even a win for the other team. In contrast, a team which is leading 1–0 will tend to concentrate and play with intensity to protect or extend their narrow lead, whilst teams leading by three or more goals have a sufficiently large buffer that comebacks are unlikely.

The cliché may be invoked by coaches to encourage their players to maintain effort levels after obtaining a two-goal lead.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.soccerclassroom.com/coaching-blog/the-most-dangerous-lead-in-soccer-2-0/|title=The Most Dangerous Lead in Soccer: 2–0|date=27 June 2011|newspaper=Soccer Classroom|access-date=9 December 2016}}</ref> It can also be used in broadcasting, such as by a [[sport commentator|commentator]] or studio [[pundit]], to suggest that the final result is still in doubt, thereby maintaining audience interest in a game.

There is little evidence that 2–0 is the worst lead in practice. In association football, a team leading 2–0 at half-time only goes on to lose the game in about 2% of cases.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/805422534023872512|title=OptaJoe on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|access-date=9 December 2016}}</ref> A 2017 analysis by Sky Sports showed that between August 1992 and July 2017, there had been  2,766 occasions in the [[English Premier League]] where a team established two-goal lead. Of these matches, 2,481 resulted in victories for the leading team, 212 ended in draws, and 73 in defeats.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Adam |title=Sky Sports bust common football myths: Is 2-0 the worst lead? |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11096/10951284/sky-sports-bust-common-myths-is-2-0-the-worst-lead |access-date=2025-10-07 |website=Sky Sports |language=en}}</ref> In [[ice hockey]], statistics show that if a team builds a two-goal advantage, they go on to win the game in the majority of instances, and that a one-goal lead is far more dangerous. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.puckscene.com/2011/08/the-most-dangerous-lead-in-hockey-fact-or-myth/|title="The Most Dangerous Lead in Hockey" – Fact or Myth?|date=19 August 2011|newspaper=PuckScene.com|access-date=9 December 2016}}</ref>  As a result, the cliché is often used in full knowledge that 2–0 is not in fact the worst possible lead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thepowerofgoals.blogspot.com/2016/03/martinez-blows-most-dangerous-of-leads.html|title=The Power of Goals.: "Martinez Blows Most Dangerous of Leads"!|last=Taylor|first=Mark|date=6 March 2016|website=The Power of Goals.|access-date=9 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/blog/2015/01/28/debunking-myth-dangerous-two-nil-lead|title=Debunking the myth of the 'dangerous two-nil lead'|newspaper=The World Game|access-date=9 December 2016}}</ref>

==Examples of usage==
The cliché was popularized by Czech football coach and television commentator [[Josef Csaplár]] in the Czech football community. His use of the term suggested that a 2–0 half-time lead could only end in a defeat and the cliché is known in the [[Czech Republic]] as ''Csaplár's trap'' ({{langx|cs|Csaplárova past}}).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.o2sport.cz/fotbal/csaplar-efekt-se-nastesti-nepotvrdil-fotbalova-francie-vola-narodni-tym/|title=Csaplár efekt se nepotvrdil, Francie volá národní tým!|date=7 September 2015|website=O2 Sport|language=cs|access-date=9 December 2016|archive-date=20 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220131428/https://www.o2sport.cz/fotbal/csaplar-efekt-se-nastesti-nepotvrdil-fotbalova-francie-vola-narodni-tym/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sport.aktualne.cz/fotbal/bednar-a-lafata-si-prekazeli-plzen-skripla-csaplarova-past/r~2f013818132d11e3a431002590604f2e/|title=Bednář a Lafata si překáželi.

In [[Serbia]], the cliché is known for being used by manager and former player [[Milan Živadinović]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mozzartsport.com/fudbal/vesti/kako-ono-rece-ziva-2-0-je-najopasniji-rezultat/129469|author=Mozzart Sport|title=Kako ono reče Živa – 2:0 je najopasniji rezultat|access-date=15 July 2018|date=4 March 2016|language=sr}}</ref>

The cliché was also used by Australian former player and TV broadcaster [[Johnny Warren]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VtiNXrFEJ4kC&pg=PA207|title=Offsider - a Memoir: How a Scrawny Pommy Kid Learned to Love the Socceroos|last=Mangan|first=Patrick|publisher=Melbourne University Publishing|year=2010|isbn=978-0522857214|location=Australia|pages=207|quote=At some stage in the previous twenty minutes, in the TV gantry not far from us, Johnny Warren had no doubt uttered one of his favourite truisms: that 2-0 is a dangerous lead.

In [[Poland]], the cliché ''2-0 to niebezpieczny wynik'' ({{langx|pl|2-0 is a dangerous result}}) has been popularized by coach [[Czesław Michniewicz]] since at least 2005. In 2022 media used this cliché in connection to a game that [[Poland national football team]], managed by Michniewicz, failed to win despite leading 2–0 against [[Netherlands national football team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://przegladsportowy.onet.pl/pilka-nozna/reprezentacja-polski/holandia-polska-czeslaw-michniewicz-doswiadczyl-wlasnej-klatwy-liga-narodow/6kpsqb4|author=Przegląd Sportowy|title=Klątwa Czesława Michniewicza dopadła go w reprezentacji.

Former football manager [[Jürgen Klopp]] has once stated the danger behind a 2-0 lead after Liverpool two-goal win against Inter Milan in the first leg of the 2022 Champions League, explaining that teams may become complacent which allows the opposition a chance to comeback.

Television pundit and former [[England national football team|England]] international footballer [[Gary Lineker]] questioned the cliché's veracity during a 2016 match between [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] while the latter were 2–0 ahead.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=GaryLineker|number=805420867199135744|date=4 December 2016|title=When did 2-0 up become a dangerous score?

The suspect is not high.}}</ref> On that occasion, Liverpool did surrender both a 2–0 and 3–1 lead to lose 4–3.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38121184|title=Bournemouth 4-3 Liverpool|date=4 December 2016|newspaper=BBC Sport|access-date=9 December 2016}}</ref>
