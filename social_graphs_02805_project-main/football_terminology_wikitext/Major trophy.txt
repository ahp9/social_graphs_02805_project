[[File:Stretford End Clock Banner.JPG|thumb|[[Manchester United]] fans formerly maintained a banner at [[Old Trafford]] mocking rivals [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for the long period they had gone without winning a major trophy; from 2010, this sign marks 34 years since City won the [[1975–76 Football League Cup]]. (In the interim, City had won the [[2001–02 Football League|2001–02 Football League Division One]], but this is not considered a "major trophy" by English football fans.) City finally won a major honour with the [[2010–11 FA Cup]], and the banner was discontinued.]]
[[File:Community Shield 50 - Celebration9 (14904850463).jpg|thumb|[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] players after winning the [[2014 FA Community Shield]]. The competition is considered a [[pre-season friendly]] rather than a serious cup, which may account for the players' subdued celebrations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/manchester-city-man-utd-live-updates-community-shield-score-result/6OtqbP2Ya2fm/|title=Whether or not it counts as a trophy, the Community Shield matters|first=The|last=Athletic|website=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 10, 2024}}</ref>]]
"'''Major trophy'''" or "'''major honour'''" is a term used in [[football (soccer)]] to indicate a [[trophy]] or [[competition]] of high status, one which is seen as a significant achievement for top-rank [[football clubs]] to win. These are competitions which are open to every team in a country or continent, typically involve a large number of matches, and are regarded as being contests of importance. Quality of opponents, public and media interest, prize money and the competition's history all play a part in judging whether a competition is "major" or not.

In general, the term is used for the national [[Sports league|league]] competition, the national [[Single-elimination tournament|cup competition]] as well as continental competitions that are seen as being of significance.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6112947/2025/03/13/newcastles-trophy-drought-according-to-the-numbers/|title=How bad is Newcastle's trophy drought according to the numbers?

In countries where the league champion is determined by a [[Playoffs|postseason playoff tournament]] such as in Australia, Canada, and the United States, a secondary trophy awarded to the team that won the most points during the regular season (e.g. [[CPL Shield]], and [[Supporters' Shield]]) is also typically considered to be a major trophy.

[[Super cup]]s, contested by the winners of the previous year's league and cup, are generally considered "major trophies," Some super cups, such as the [[Supercopa de España]], are considered major trophies in their countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7790/artykul/3470204,lewandowski-stars-as-barcelona-clinch-100th-major-trophy-szczesny-sees-red|title=Lewandowski stars as Barcelona clinch 100th major trophy, Szczęsny sees red - English Section|website=www.polskieradio.pl}}</ref>

The significance of a trophy can change over time. For example, the English [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] (the modern EFL Cup) was originally not taken seriously, with many top teams not entering when the competition was created in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sussexexpress.co.uk/sport/football/should-clubs-be-allowed-to-opt-out-of-the-league-cup-ian-hart-1001669|title=Should clubs be allowed to opt out of the League Cup? - Ian Hart|date=August 30, 2018|website=SussexWorld}}</ref> Up to the 1990s, many teams such as [[Manchester United]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] fielded [[youth team|youth]] and [[reserve team|reserve]] players in the competition to give  first-team players a rest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homepage.eircom.net/~redweb3/home/9899/reports/domestic/forest-h.html|title=Manchester United - RedWeb3 - Treble Winners: 1998-1999 Manchester United 2:1 Nottingham Forest|website=homepage.eircom.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-cocacola-cup-league-will-not-punish-reserve-sides-1236238.html|title=Football: Coca-Cola Cup - League will not punish 'reserve' sides|website=[[Independent.co.uk]] |date=15 October 1997 }}</ref> When it was sponsored by Worthington, it was nicknamed the "Worthless Cup."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/sports_talk/1640759.stm|title=Worthless Cup?|date=November 6, 2001|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> However, in the 21st century the competition has increased in importance,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.footballfancast.com/the-league-cup/is-the-efl-cup-now-more-important-than-the-fa-cup/|title=Is the EFL Cup now more important than the FA Cup?|first=Sam|last=Cox|date=October 25, 2016|website=FootballFanCast}}</ref> in part because the winners receive a lucrative place in [[UEFA competition|European competition]] for the following season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/54133192|title=Carabao Cup: Uefa Europa Conference League place awaits winners|work=BBC Sport |date=September 15, 2020}}</ref>

Pre-season tournaments such as [[Emirates Cup]], [[Teresa Herrera Trophy]], [[International Champions Cup]] and the [[Amsterdam Tournament]] are also not considered major trophies; teams compete in them simply to gain money and exposure, and winning them is not considered a serious achievement.
