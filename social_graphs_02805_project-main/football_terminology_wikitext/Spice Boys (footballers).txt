The '''Spice Boys''' was a media pejorative used to describe a group of high-profile [[Liverpool F.C.]] [[Association football|footballers]] in the mid-late 1990s, typically [[Jamie Redknapp]], [[David James (footballer, born 1970)|David James]], [[Neil Ruddock]], [[Steve McManaman]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-61068834 |title=LIFE'S TOUGH BEING THE KOP'S SPICE BOY!

The name was a play on the [[Spice Girls]].

==Term==
The term 'Spice Boys' was coined by the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' following (unfounded) [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] rumours that Fowler was dating Spice Girl [[Emma Bunton|Baby Spice]] ([[Emma Bunton]]).<ref name="thefreelibrary1">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football:+McAteer:+I+was+never+a+Spice+Boy+but+Robbie+Fowler+could...-a080267301 |title=Football: McAteer: I was never a Spice Boy but Robbie Fowler could have been.

In the late 1990s, the influx of television and marketing revenue from the newly revamped and globally marketed [[FA Premier League]] saw footballers' wages soar. Photogenic players such as Jamie Redknapp and Welshman [[Ryan Giggs]] emerged as merchandising and mass-marketed 'poster boys' of the British game, with many players landing high-profile product endorsement contracts, such as Jason McAteer's with [[Head & Shoulders]], while David James was signed up as an Armani [[underwear]] model in 1997.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/jason-mcateer-management-the-next-big-stage-for-the-spice-boy-who-had-to-stop-being-a-clown-509142.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220524/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/jason-mcateer-management-the-next-big-stage-for-the-spice-boy-who-had-to-stop-being-a-clown-509142.html |archive-date=24 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Jason McAteer Management the next big stage for the Spice Boy who had to stop being a clown|work=The Independent on Sunday|date=1 October 2005|accessdate=14 August 2011|first=Jason|last=Burt}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/spice-boy-days-distant-memory-for-james-1378531.html|title=Spice Boy days distant memory for James|first=Glenn|last=Moore|work=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News & Media|date=17 May 2008|accessdate=14 August 2011}}</ref> With the fame of Premier League footballers reaching unprecedented levels,<ref name="fourfourtwo1">{{cite web|url=http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/rockngoal/archive/2009/04/22/how-football-became-the-new-rock-n-roll.aspx |title=How football became the new rock’n’roll - Rock'n'Goal Week |publisher=FourFourTwo |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2012-06-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227131530/http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/rockngoal/archive/2009/04/22/how-football-became-the-new-rock-n-roll.aspx |archive-date=2012-02-27 }}</ref> criticism of the perceived underachievement of the Liverpool squad soon followed. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' later described the 'Spice Boys' as a "Group of high-spirited, fun-loving young players who were a central feature of Liverpool's talented and entertaining, but perpetually under-achieving, squad of the Nineties. At least, that's the generous description. Others saw them as just an irresponsible bunch who were a bad influence in the dressing-room and should not be given house room."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/tottenham/3038405/Spice-Boys-are-dancing-to-a-new-tune.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017230451/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/tottenham/3038405/Spice-Boys-are-dancing-to-a-new-tune.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 October 2008|title=Spice Boys are dancing to a new tune|work=Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|first=Colin|last=Malam|date=24 November 2002|accessdate=14 August 2011}}</ref>

==Incidents==
Several incidents around the behaviour of the so-called Spice Boys generated major media attention, notably the squad's decision to wear matching cream [[Armani]] suits to the [[1996 FA Cup Final]] – a game they went on to lose to key rivals [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Moore |first=Glenn |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/james-suited-to-dressing-down-for-spice-boys-reunion-party-829975.html |title=James suited to dressing down for 'Spice Boys' reunion party - FA & League Cups - Football |publisher=The Independent |date=2008-05-17 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Robbie Fowler told the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' in 2008 that "People still remind me about the white suits all the time. It's one of those things – if we had won the game nobody would have mentioned it but we lost and it has become infamous."<ref>{{cite web|author=James Nursery |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport-old/football/2008/05/14/robbie-fowler-tells-david-james-i-blame-you-for-the-cream-suits-115875-20417255/ |title=Robbie Fowler tells David James: I blame you for the cream suits - Mirror Online |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>

McManaman and Fowler were also associated with the controversial "dentist's chair" story prior to [[Euro 1996]].<ref>{{cite web|author=What to do when you stick it away... |url=http://www.virginmedia.com/sport/football/galleries/goal-celebration.php?ssid=4 |title=The dentist's chair - The best (and worst) goal celebrations of all time - Pictures - Sport |publisher=Virgin Media |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Rumours of a controversial 1998 Christmas party also filled the press.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/why-office-christmas-parties-are-out-of-favour-513494.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220524/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/why-office-christmas-parties-are-out-of-favour-513494.html |archive-date=24 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Why office Christmas parties are out of favour |publisher=The Independent |date=2005-11-01 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref><ref name="guardian1">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/observer/osm/story/0,,583485,00.html |title=The 10 worst examples of footballers behaving badly |publisher=Observer.guardian.co.uk |date=2011-02-09 |access-date=2012-06-14}}</ref> "Win, draw or lose, first to the bar for booze," was the dressing-room mantra, reportedly according to [[Neil Ruddock]]. Certain members of the Liverpool squad would sometimes be seen after matches flying down to London to get to the capital's nightclubs, such as Chinawhite, Ten Rooms or the Emporium, by 9pm. Players were romantically linked with known figures, such as [[Phil Babb]] dating the glamour model [[Jo Guest]]. Ruddock was quoted as saying "We were the first players to get big money, Porsches and Ferraris and get page three birds into bed."<ref>{{cite web|website=The Guardian|accessdate=21 December 2023|first=Rob|last=Smyth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/oct/22/manchester-united-liverpool-class-of-92-spice-boys-eric-cantona|title= Manchester United 2-2 Liverpool: the Class of 92, Spice Boys and Cantona’s return|date=22 October 2015}}</ref> Ruddock shared an anecdote on the ''[[Sky Sports]]'' television show ''[[Soccer AM]]'' that Liverpool players would play a game during their fixtures where they would pass a pound coin between them in-match, and whoever was left holding it at the final whistle would have to pay for the first round of drinks after the game.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jonathan|last=Turton|date=27 March 2016|website=Liverpool Echo|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/were-liverpool-fcs-spice-boys-11054621|title= Were Liverpool FC's Spice Boys really as bad as their white suits suggest?}}</ref>

The players were also linked to music industry figures, with [[Robbie Williams]] joining the squad on the team bus before and after a Premier League fixture against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/11531298/John-Scales-admits-Spice-Boy-era-Liverpool-were-caught-in-a-time-warp.html|website=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=21 December 2023|title= John Scales admits Spice Boy-era Liverpool were caught in a 'time warp'|first=Si|last=Hughes|date=12 April 2015}}</ref> Jamie Redknapp, Jason McAteer and Phil Babb appeared in the music video ''[[One Kiss from Heaven]]'' by the pop singer [[Louise Nurding|Louise]] in November 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/20211119126628/louise-redknapp-video-featuring-jamie-naked-album/?viewas=amp|website=Hello Magazine|accessdate=21 December 2023|title= Louise Redknapp shares video featuring ex-husband Jamie Redknapp as she celebrates milestone|date=19 November 2021|first=Andrea|last=Caamano}}</ref>

===Decline of use===
Following the departure of Liverpool manager [[Roy Evans]] in 1998, with his co-manager [[Gérard Houllier]] taking full charge, the majority of the Spice Boy players were slowly transferred out of the squad or put under greater pressure to perform.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Louise |title=James rejoins old Spice Boys for a new City revival |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jan/16/newsstory.sport1 |access-date=4 November 2023 |work=The Guardian |date=16 January 2004}}</ref> The term gradually declined in media use, although was briefly revived when, in 2004, James, Fowler and McManaman were reunited at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], under [[Kevin Keegan]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Keegan splashes on old spice|first=Phil|last=McNulty |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3395771.stm |access-date=4 November 2023 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 January 2004}}</ref>
