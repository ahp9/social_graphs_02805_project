Due to its style of play, "The Machine" is often cataloged as a pioneer in the practice of the so-called [[Total Football]], and the South American predecessor of the Hungarian national teams of the 50's, and the ''Clockwork Orange'' [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]] of the 1970's.<ref>[https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-total-football-famous-tactics-explained-the-clubs/w5yd5dzofn4p17ewmav4atk2b What is Total Football?

The nickname was given to them by Borocotó, a [[Uruguay]]an sports journalist working for [[El Gráfico (Argentina)|El Gráfico]], after River Plate defeated [[Chacarita Juniors]] 6–2 on 12 June 1942. Borocotó used that adjective to illustrate the performance of the forward line on the field.<ref>[http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/coberturas-historicas/1942-nace-la-maquina-de-river.php "1942: Nace la Máquina de River"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903083858/http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/coberturas-historicas/1942-nace-la-maquina-de-river.php |date=2011-09-03 }}: article on ''[[El Gráfico (Argentina)|El Gráfico]]''</ref>

For their dynamism and rotating positions, ''La Máquina'' is often considered a precursor of the famous ''Clockwork Orange'' as it was nicknamed the [[Netherlands national football team]] that played the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite book|title = El fútbol a sol y sombra|last = Galeano|first = Eduardo|publisher = Siglo Veintiuno|year = 2000|isbn = 9682319714|location = Madrid|pages = 164}}</ref> In 1941, River Plate's La Máquina coaches, [[Renato Cesarini]] and [[Carlos Peucelle]], started using the left winger [[Adolfo Pedernera]] as a man of reference  "switching him to a more central and withdrawn role and inviting him to alternate between driving into the box to finish moves off and sitting back to direct them". It was one of the first uses of the figure of the [[false nine]]. When Pedernera transferred to [[Club Atlético Atlanta|Atlanta]], a young [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]] took his place.<ref name="false9History">{{cite web |url=https://www .fifa.com/news/pedernera-the-twinkle-toed-engine-driver-2604360 |title=The engine driver of La Máquina and El Ballet Azul |publisher=Fifa |last1=Tighe |first1=Sam |date=12 May 2020|access-date=17 April 2022 }}</ref>

The first time they played together was on June 28, 1942, in Estadio Monumental v. [[Club Atlético Platense|Platense]]. River Plate won by 1-0, with Félix Loustau replacing Aristóbulo Deambrossi as left winger.

From 1943 to 1946 the team achieved two championships and finished as runner-up twice. Other players that took part of ''La Máquina'' were Aristóbulo Deambrossi, [[Carlos Peucelle]], Alberto Gallo and [[Renato Cesarini]].
