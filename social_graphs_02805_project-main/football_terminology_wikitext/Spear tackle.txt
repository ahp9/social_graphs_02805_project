A '''spear tackle''' is an illegal [[tackle (football move)|tackle]] in [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]] and [[Australian rules football]] in which a player lifts another player into the air and drops them so that they land on their back, head or neck.<ref>[http://www.rugbyrefs.com/wiki/index.php?title=Tip_Tackles RugbyRefs.com Tip Tackle Explained]</ref> Spear tackles have caused serious injury<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Perth-boy-charged-over-spear-tackle/2007/02/07/1170524152811.html Perth boy charged over spear-tackle | SMH.com.au]</ref> including spinal damage, dislocations,<ref>[http://uk.sports.yahoo.com/26102005/3/new-o-driscoll-video-sparks-irb-spear-tackle-warning.html Yahoo!

==Rugby union==
The term "spear tackle" has been in use since at least 1995.<ref>''[[The Irish Times]]'', Saturday 25 November 1995, page 17.</ref> [[World Rugby]] (previously called the IRB) has ruled that a dangerous tackle of this type, sometimes also called a 'tip tackle', should be punished with a straight [[Ejection (sports)|red card]]. An IRB memorandum on dangerous tackles from 8 June 2009 states: "At a subsequent IRB High Performance Referee Seminar at Lensbury referees were advised that for these types of tackles they were to start at red card as a sanction and work backwards."<ref>[http://www.deepsouthrugbyunion.com/images/IRB_Memorandum_re_Dangerous_Tackles.pdf IRB memorandum, Dangerous Tackles, 8 June 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328164740/http://www.deepsouthrugbyunion.com/images/IRB_Memorandum_re_Dangerous_Tackles.pdf |date=28 March 2013 }}</ref>

The IRB amended the law (Law 10.4(j)), in December 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2040903.html |title=International Rugby Board - Law amendments put player welfare first |website=www.irb.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128035802/http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2040903.html |archive-date=2010-11-28}} </ref>  In the previous version of the law, the tackled player's head or shoulders had to hit the ground first for a referee to penalise them.  The revised law removes the possibility of a spearing tackle not being penalised if the tackled player breaks their fall with their arms.

==Rugby league==
The [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) competition in Australia awards a [[Penalty (rugby)|penalty]] for players being lifted beyond the horizontal. A spear tackle where their body is in a vertical position, with their head facing the ground usually results in a send-off. It is often termed a "dangerous throw". Generally, these tackles are also put "on report" meaning that in the coming week the judiciary is forced to review the incident and pursue the matter further if deemed appropriate, although particularly bad examples may be punished by sending the player off, reducing his team to one less player on the field. This term is used throughout the northern and southern hemispheres.

==Australian rules football==
In the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), it is a reportable offence, and players found guilty face the [[AFL Tribunal|tribunal]] and possible suspension with at least a two match ban.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
