The '''rainbow kick''' (also called the '''Reverse heel flick-over''', the '''Rainbow flick''', the '''Carretilha''' or the '''Lambreta''' in Brazil, the '''Lambretta''' in Italy, the '''Brazilian''' in Romania, the '''[[Osvaldo Ardiles|Ardiles]] flick''' in the UK, the '''Arco iris''' in Spain, the '''[[Jay-Jay Okocha|Okocha]]-Trick''' in Germany and the '''''Coup du sombrero''''' in France)<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/mar/08/theknowledge.sport Sprechen sie Fußball?]<span class="textlinkplus">, Paul Doyle, [http://guardian.co.uk guardian.co.uk], Wednesday 8 March 2006</span></ref><ref name="Rainbow Kick Lambretta tutorial">[http://fifa2008.wordpress.com/2007/12/05/rainbow-kick-lambretta-tutorial/ Rainbow Kick (Lambretta) tutorial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711175220/http://fifa2008.wordpress.com/2007/12/05/rainbow-kick-lambretta-tutorial/ |date=2008-07-11 }}<span class="textlinkplus">, from [http://fifa2008.wordpress.com fifa2008.wordpress.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305043344/http://fifa2008.wordpress.com/ |date=2010-03-05 }}, accessed 12 July 2008</span></ref><ref>Witzig (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=H2T0ZD5S86QC&q=rainbow&pg=PA23  page 23]</ref><ref>{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20120916050154/http://www.nakedtranslations.com/en/2006/coup-du-sombrero Naked Translations, Coup du sombrero]}}, accessed 7 May 2012</ref> is a [[Football tactics and skills|trick]] used in [[association football]], in which a player steps to the side of the ball and flicks it up. The trajectory of the ball gives the trick its name. The trick is usually performed while running forward with the ball, and is done by rolling the ball up the back of one leg with the other foot, before flicking the standing foot upwards to propel the ball forward and over the head.

There are some variations of the rainbow flicks, such as the Advanced rainbow flick, and one popularized by [[Neymar]], the Neymar Rocket.

The '''advanced rainbow flick''' involves flicking up the ball to your waist, (sometimes using the [[Ronaldinho]] flick-up.) and hitting the ball with the outside of your boot, while also leaning forward. The '''Neymar Rocket''' is similar to the normal Rainbow flick, however, instead of rolling the ball up your leg, you lock the ball tightly between your legs, specifically the ankles. Simultaneously, lean forward, and jump while keeping a tight grip in the air, with the legs coming up at a side. When the ball reaches ''knee height'', release your top foot and lob the ball over with your bottom foot.

==History==
This trick is an impressive show of skill, sometimes seen in [[street soccer]] or [[futsal]].<ref>Witzig (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=H2T0ZD5S86QC&q=rainbow&pg=PA25 page 25]</ref> It is rarely used in modern professional football, as it has a relatively low success rate, but players with high confidence and skill may attempt it from time to time as a [[Dummy (football)|feint]], to beat opposing players when [[dribbling]].<ref>Witzig (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=H2T0ZD5S86QC&q=rainbow&pg=PA23 page 23]</ref> It has been used by players such as [[Jay-Jay Okocha]] or [[Neymar]].

It was first executed in 1968, by [[Alexandre de Carvalho]] "Kaneco".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKDFVcKf_SY |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/gKDFVcKf_SY |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Carretilha de Kaneco Santos FC 1968|date=20 December 2014 |via=www.youtube.com}}{{cbignore}}</ref> It's said that it was invented by [[Vito Chimenti]], a forward player who also played in [[Palermo F.C.|Palermo]], and it's said that the rainbow kick performed in the famous film [[Escape to Victory]] was inspired by him.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Morto Vito Chimenti, l'attaccante rosanero che creò la "bicicletta".

In March 2008, the [[Sheffield Wednesday]] player [[Franck Songo'o]] attempted the trick, with one match report commenting that the referee "quickly called a halt to proceedings as [opposing] players piled in threatening to lynch [him]".<ref>[http://www.qprnet.com/firstteam/0708/matchreports/sheffwedsa.shtml Owls swoop as Rangers go for a Burton] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807164953/http://www.qprnet.com/firstteam/0708/matchreports/sheffwedsa.shtml |date=2008-08-07 }}, Simon Skinnner, Saturday 8 March 2008</ref>

The rainbow kick appears in a famous sequence in the 1981 film ''[[Escape to Victory]]'', when the trick is used by the character played by [[Osvaldo Ardiles]], which led to the name of "Ardiles flick". One review described it thus: "the all time special effects highlight being when Osvaldo Ardiles flicks the ball over his head".<ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/58862/the-stars-of-track-and-screen/ The Stars of Track and Screen]<span class="textlinkplus">, by Robert Collins, [http://www.popmatters.com www.popmatters.com], 21 May 2008</span></ref><ref>[http://www.thespinningimage.co.uk/cultfilms/displaycultfilm.asp?reviewid=515 Review of Escape to Victory], by Phil Michaels at ''The Spinning Edge'', accessed 12 July 2008</ref>

The trick has also been featured in football computer games, including ''[[FIFA 08]]'', where it is described as "One of the most famous soccer moves".<ref name="Rainbow Kick Lambretta tutorial"/> Brazilian Superstar [[Neymar]] is a notable exponent of the rainbow flick in the modern game.<ref>{{cite news|title=Neymar pulls off ridiculous spinning rainbow flick to score in charity match|url=http://babb.telegraph.co.uk/2014/12/neymar-pulls-off-ridiculous-spinning-rainbow-flick-to-score-in-charity-match/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224221008/http://babb.telegraph.co.uk/2014/12/neymar-pulls-off-ridiculous-spinning-rainbow-flick-to-score-in-charity-match/|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 December 2014|publisher=The Telegraph|date=29 November 2015}}</ref>
