[[File:David Beckham 2010 LA Galaxy.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Beckham]] was the league's first Designated Player, with the rule being nicknamed the "Beckham Rule".]]

The '''Designated Player Rule''', nicknamed the '''Beckham Rule''', allows [[Major League Soccer]] franchises to sign up to three players that would be considered outside their [[salary cap]] (either by offering the player higher wages or by paying a transfer fee for the player). The rule, which was adopted ahead of the 2007 MLS season, enables teams to compete for star players in the international football market. The rule is one of two mechanisms by which MLS teams may exceed their salary cap, the other being [[allocation money]]. As of December 2019, there have been 209 Designated Players in league history.

The rule is informally named after [[David Beckham]], in anticipation of MLS teams signing lucrative deals with internationally recognized players, after Beckham entered into negotiations to join the league.<ref name="HollywoodEnding">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2011/11/28/106135817/hollywood-ending|title=Hollywood Ending: If this was indeed David Beckham's final game in MLS, he went out in style, carrying the Galaxy to a championship and affirming the value of star power in America|last=Wahl|first=Grant|date=November 28, 2011|magazine=Sports Illustrated|access-date=November 25, 2011|quote=In the first four seasons of MLS's Beckham Rule, which allowed clubs to sign up to three designated players outside the salary cap, ....}}</ref><ref name="Lansley, Pete">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060413/asp/sports/story_6093255.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414155630/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060413/asp/sports/story_6093255.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 14, 2006|title=Becks could be the next American idol|work=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]|access-date=December 1, 2007|date=April 13, 2007|author=Lansley, Pete}}</ref> Beckham was the first player signed under this rule, signing a five-year contract with the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] in 2007 with a guaranteed annual salary of $6.5 million.<ref name="PlayersUnion">{{cite web |url=http://www.mlsplayers.org/salary_info.html |title=PlayersUnion |publisher=Mlsplayers.org |access-date=April 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511125731/http://www.mlsplayers.org/salary_info.html |archive-date=May 11, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Beckham hopes to make US history">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/6256125.stm|title=Beckham hopes to make US history|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=December 1, 2007 | date=January 12, 2007}}</ref>

==History==
The team salary cap was estimated to be around [[United States dollar|US$]]1.9 million in 2006,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/26/AR2006042602276.html|title=Palencia Has Richest MLS Salary|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=December 1, 2007|date=April 26, 2006|author=Goff, Steven}}</ref> was $2.1 million in 2007, and was raised to $2.3 million for the 2008 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=article.main&articleId=57143&requestTimeout=900|title=Debate highlights MLS salary cap split|work=Sports Business Journal|access-date=December 1, 2007|date=November 26, 2007|author=Mickle, Tripp|archive-date=August 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813112138/http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=article.main&articleId=57143&requestTimeout=900|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=nytdp09>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/18/sports/soccer/18soccer.html?ref=soccer|title=In M.L.S., Designated Players Do Not Guarantee Great Expectations|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 18, 2009|date=March 18, 2009|author=Bell, Jack}}</ref> As part of the 2010 Collective Bargaining Agreement between MLS and the MLS Players' Union, the 2010 salary cap was $2.55 million, with an automatic five percent increase each year until the expiration of the agreement at the end of the 2014 season.

Under the 2007 rule:
*The rule expires at the end of the 2009 season, and must be renewed then or allowed to lapse.
*For each Designated Player, $400,000<ref name=nytdp09 /><ref>{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/soccer_america/02/24/aeg.beckham/ | publisher=CNN | title=Galaxy, Milan, Inter wait on Becks | date=February 24, 2009 | access-date=May 1, 2010 | archive-date=October 24, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024064112/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/soccer_america/02/24/aeg.beckham/ | url-status=dead }}</ref> of his salary is charged to the salary cap and paid by the league, with any remaining salary being paid by the team's operator. This value was increased for the 2009 season to $415,000.
*Prior to the 2007 season, there were three players whose salary exceeded $400,000. These players were [[Landon Donovan]], [[Carlos Ruiz (Guatemalan footballer)|Carlos Ruiz]], and [[Eddie Johnson (American soccer)|Eddie Johnson]]. According to the rule, these players were [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]] in for the 2007 season, and the exemption was extended after the 2007 season, with the league planning to review the issue at a future date. It was possible that the league would be required to renegotiate these players' contracts or consider them Designated Players. However, prior to the start of the 2008 season, Johnson moved to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] of the [[Premier League]],<ref>

</ref> while following [[Dwayne De Rosario]]'s signing by Toronto FC in January 2009, Ruiz was released by the club and left MLS to play for [[Olimpia Asunción]]. This left Donovan as the lone player whose 2009 salary remained grandfathered under the exemption provision. However, there were several more players whose guaranteed salary exceeded the Designated Player amount, but whose salary cap expense was actually lower than their true salary due to the [[Allocation (MLS)|allocation rule]]. These players include [[Shalrie Joseph]] ($450,000), [[Christian Gomez]] ($430,000), Dwayne De Rosario ($425,750), and [[Taylor Twellman]] ($420,000).
*Each team initially had one Designated Player spot, but could trade their Designated Spot to another team; teams were allowed a maximum of two Designated Players.
*Only $325,000 of a team's second Designated Player counted against the salary cap, which was increased to $335,000 in 2009.<ref name=nytdp09 />

The 2010 changes:<ref>{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/soundersfcblog/2011498898_major_league_soccer_adds_secon.html#continue |title=Major League Soccer adds second DP slot, can purchase a third (league release) |first=Joshua |last=Mayers |date=April 1, 2010 |work=The Seattle Times |access-date=April 2, 2010}}</ref>
*The rule has no expiration date.
*For each Designated Player, $335,000 of his salary is charged to the salary cap and paid by the league ($167,500 for DP players joining during the MLS summer transfer window), with any remaining salary being paid by the team's operator. This amount is halved for Designated Players signed in the middle of the season. The salary cap value of Designated Players can also be reduced using allocation money. Finally, teams whose Designated Players transfer abroad in the middle of a season can recoup part of the Designated Players' salary cap value.
*Landon Donovan is no longer grandfathered into the rule and must be considered a Designated Player.
*Each team is allowed two Designated Player spots, and they can no longer trade their Designated Player spots. The [[New York Red Bulls]] will receive $70,000 in allocation money in return for the nullification of their 2007 trade with [[C.D. Chivas USA|Chivas USA]] for an additional Designated Player spot. This means that both New York and Chivas USA will have two Designated Player spots for the 2010 season.
*Teams can pay a $250,000 "luxury tax" for the right to sign a third Designated Player. This $250,000 would be distributed equally to all MLS teams that have not signed a third Designated Player in the form of [[Allocation (MLS)|allocation money]].

The 2012 changes:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/2012-mls-roster-rules |title=2012 MLS Roster Rules |work=mlssocer.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220005943/http://www.mlssoccer.com/2012-mls-roster-rules |archive-date=February 20, 2012 }}</ref>

Starting with the 2012 season, the rule was changed with respect to younger players. MLS announced the changes in August 2011 after clubs expressed concern about signing young international players with no guarantees that they would develop into stars.

* Designated Players over the age of 23 will carry a salary budget charge of $350,000, unless the player joins his club in the middle of the season, in which case his budget charge will be $175,000.
* Designated Players 21–23 years old count as $200,000 against the club's salary budget.
* Designated Players 20 years old or younger count as $150,000 against the club's salary budget.
* The budget charge for the midseason signing of a young Designated Player (23 years old and younger) is $150,000 and this amount cannot be lowered with allocation funds. 
* Clubs will not have to buy the third DP roster slot to accommodate Designated Players 23 years old and younger.
* Age of player is determined by year (not date) of birth.

The maximum budget charge for Designated Players over age 23 was increased to $368,750 for 2013, $387,500 in 2014, $436,250 in 2015, $457,500 in 2016, and $480,625 in 2017. The budget charge for those who join during the midseason transfer window has remained at one-half of the full-season cap charge since the inception of the rule. The budget charges for younger players have not changed since 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/roster-rules-and-regulations |title=Roster Rules and Regulations |publisher=Major League Soccer |access-date=May 11, 2015 |archive-date=August 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823031630/http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/roster-rules-and-regulations |url-status=dead }}</ref>

'''Notes'''
* Chart indicates when players signed their current Designated Player contract, not necessarily their first year in MLS.
* Other players in MLS may also be paid a salary that takes them above the Designated Player threshold, but they have had their salary reduced against the salary cap using General or Targeted Allocation Money.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/league/official-rules/mls-roster-rules-and-regulations#targeted-allocation-money|title=MLS Roster Rules and Regulations - MLSsoccer.com|access-date=June 20, 2017}}</ref>
* Player salaries may be below the Designated Player threshold, but their transfer fee might mean the total compensation takes them above the threshold.
* Player salaries include compensation from their MLS contract, not including any bonuses or compensation from contracts with individual teams or their affiliates.
† Player on loan at another club outside MLS<br>
‡ Player on loan from another club inside MLS

==Club DP history==
{{updated|July 1, 2025|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/glossary/former-designated-player|title=Former MLS Designated Players|access-date=August 22, 2017}}</ref>}}
'''Notes'''
* The below list indicates players who have had their contract assigned as a Designated Player (DP) contract during their time in MLS. Players may have not always have had a DP contract, or have later had their contract negotiated below a DP level. Similarly, some players have been in MLS whose salary has been at a DP level, but the club has opted to bring their salary below the DP threshold using General Allocation Money or Targeted Allocation Money. Their listed "Years as DP" indicates what seasons they were active as a DP for that club only. Players in '''bold''' are currently signed to a DP contract by their club.
* Former MLS sides [[Miami Fusion]] and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] were dissolved before the introduction of the Designated Player Rule.
