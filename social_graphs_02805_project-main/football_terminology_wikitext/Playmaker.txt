{{About|an association football term|other uses}}

In [[association football]], a '''playmaker''' is a footballer who controls the flow of the team's play, and is often involved in  offensively and defensively playing [[Passing (association football)|passing]] moves which lead to [[Goal (sport)|goal]]s, through their vision, technique, ball control, creativity and passing ability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/playmaker|title=Playmaker – Define Playmaker at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}</ref> They are sometimes called the '''"number 10"''' of the team, as they often wear the [[Squad number (association football)|number 10 jersey]].

In English football, the term overlaps somewhat with an [[attacking midfielder]] although playmakers are not necessarily constrained to a single position. Several playmakers can also operate on the [[Winger (association football)|wings]] or as a creative, [[supporting striker]]; some can also function in a more [[Central midfielder|central midfield]] role, alternating between playing in more offensive roles and participating in the build-up plays in the midfield. Other players still function as deep-lying playmakers, in a free role, [[Defensive midfielder|behind the midfield line]]. Playmakers are not usually known for their defensive capabilities, which is why they are often supported by a [[Defensive Midfielder|defensive midfielder]]. As many midfielders and [[Forward (association football)|forwards]] have the aforementioned creative and technical attributes, they tend to be the playmakers of a team.

==Advanced playmakers==

The most complete and versatile playmakers are often known as advanced playmakers, or free-role playmakers, as they can operate both in central, attacking midfield positions, and in wider positions on the wings. The attacking playmakers are sometimes called the "number 10" of the team, as they often wear the [[Squad number (association football)|number 10 jersey]]. The [[Attacking midfielder|attacking midfield]] playmaker will sit in a free role between the midfield and the forwards, either in the centre of the pitch or on either flank. These offensive playmakers will often make incisive passes to the wingers or forwards, seeing them through on goal or to deliver killer crosses, as well as scoring goals themselves. They are also usually quick, agile, and highly technical players with good vision, [[Shooting (association football)|shooting]], passing, [[Cross (football)|crossing]] and [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] ability; they are known for scoring goals as well as providing [[Assist (football)|assists]], through-balls, and initiating attacking plays. In Italian football, as creative, technical, advanced playmakers are known not to be reserved to a single position, they are often described as the "fantasista" or "trequartista".<ref name="The Fantasista">{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasista10.co.uk/category/playmakers/|title=The Fantasista|website=Fantasista10.co.uk|access-date=20 August 2014}}</ref> In Brazil, the offensive playmaker is known as the "meia atacante",<ref name="MTV: Playmaker">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/playmaker/biography/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112070624/http://www.mtv.com/artists/playmaker/biography/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 12, 2015|title=Playmaker|publisher=MTV|access-date=5 January 2015}}</ref> whereas in Argentina, it is known as the "enganche".<ref name="Tactics: the changing role of the playmaker">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/features/tactics-the-changing-role-of-the-playmaker|title=Tactics: the changing role of the playmaker|work=World Soccer|access-date=5 January 2015}}</ref> In the English language, this position is sometimes colloquially referred to as playing "in the hole", as these playmakers often link the midfield and attack by essentially operating in the gap between the opposition's midfield and defence.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2240506-why-playmakers-are-the-premier-leagues-most-prized-assets |title=Why Playmakers Are the Premier League's Most Prized Assets |publisher=Bleacher Report |author1=Felix Keith |date=22 October 2014 |access-date=8 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name="in the hole">{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/performance/tactics/link-midfield-and-attack-striker-hole |title=Link midfield and attack with a striker in the hole |publisher=FourFourTwo |author1=Ben Welch |date=24 February 2012 |access-date=8 December 2018 }}</ref> [[Diego Maradona]], [[Zico (footballer)|Zico]], [[Michel Platini]], [[Marta (footballer)|Marta]], [[Pelé]], [[Zinedine Zidane]], [[Kaká]], [[Lionel Messi]], [[Roberto Baggio]], [[Rui Costa]], [[Michael Laudrup]], [[Gheorghe Hagi]], [[Jay-Jay Okocha]], [[Shunsuke Nakamura]], [[Juan Román Riquelme]] and [[Francesco Totti]] are some examples of footballers who have been fielded as advanced midfield playmakers throughout their career.<ref name="question"/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071208091148/http://www.fifa.com/newscentre/news/newsid=76134.html "The Number 10"].

Deep-lying playmakers are often known for their vision, technique and passing. Many are also known for their ability to switch the play or provide [[Long ball|long passes]] that pick out players making attacking runs, as well as their striking ability from distance. Although several deep-lying playmakers are not known for their tackling, work-rate, or defensive skills, it has become more common for a [[box-to-box midfielder]] with good passing, technique, vision and ball-winning ability, such as [[Yaya Touré]], to play in this role, since it is in a similar position to that of a defensive midfielder, and the role allows them to break down plays and subsequently create scoring opportunities themselves after winning back possession. In a 2013 article for ''[[The Guardian]]'', writer Jonathan Wilson described this unique creative holding midfield role as that of a "creator," citing [[Xabi Alonso]] as a typical example of player who operated in this position, noting that: "Xabi Alonso, although capable of making tackles, focused on keeping the ball moving, occasionally raking long passes out to the flanks to change the angle of attack like an old-style ''regista''."<ref name="changing role of holding midfielders"/>

In Italy, the deep-lying playmaker is known as a "regista",<ref name=Football-Analysis>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-analysis.com/the-regista-and-the-evolution-of-the-playmaker/|title=The Regista And the Evolution Of The Playmaker|website=Football-Analysis.com|access-date=5 January 2015|archive-date=7 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107185452/http://www.football-analysis.com/the-regista-and-the-evolution-of-the-playmaker/|url-status=dead}}</ref> whereas in Brazil, it is known as a "meia-armador".<ref name="MTV: Playmaker"/> In Italy, the role of the ''regista'' developed from the [[centre half]]-back or ''centromediano metodista'' position in [[Vittorio Pozzo]]'s ''[[Formation (association football)#Metodo (2–3–2–3)|metodo]]'' system (a precursor of the central or holding midfield position in the 2–3–2–3 formation), as the ''metodista'''s responsibilities were not entirely defensive but also creative; as such, the ''metodista'' was not solely tasked with breaking down possession, but also with starting attacking plays after winning back the ball.<ref name="ritiri e regista">{{cite news |url=https://www.corriere.it/sport/cards/mezzo-secolo-senza-vittorio-pozzo-mitico-discusso-ct-che-cambio-calcio-italiano/ritiri-regista.shtml |title=Mezzo secolo senza Vittorio Pozzo, il mitico (e discusso) c.t. che cambiò il calcio italiano: Ritiri e regista |work=Il Corriere della Sera |language=it |last1=Radogna |first1=Fiorenzo |page=8 |date=20 December 2018 |access-date=15 April 2020 }}</ref> [[Xavi (footballer, born 1980)|Xavi]], [[Andrea Pirlo]], [[Toni Kroos]], [[Luka Modrić]], [[Michael Carrick]], [[Paul Scholes]], [[Miralem Pjanić]], [[Jorginho (footballer, born December 1991)|Jorginho]], [[Marcos Senna]], [[Sunday Oliseh]], and [[Pep Guardiola]] are some more examples of players who operated as deep-lying playmakers throughout their careers.<ref name="changing role of holding midfielders"/><ref name="question">[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/aug/18/what-is-a-playmakers-role-in-modern-game "The Question: What is a playmaker's role in the modern game?"].

Playmakers are not necessarily constrained to a single position; many attacking playmakers in modern football play a combination of these different attacking roles, often operating in a free position. Some playmakers can also function in a more central [[Midfield (association football)|midfield]] role, or can even be given the freedom to alternate between playing in more offensive creative roles and participating in the build-up plays and controlling the team's tempo in a deeper midfield position, such as Zinedine Zidane,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://backpagefootball.com/zinedine-zidane-the-flawed-genius/30147/|work=Back Page Football|title=Zinedine Zidane: The Flawed Genius|author1=Ciaran Kelly|date=7 December 2011|access-date=6 July 2015}}</ref><ref name="Year Zero">{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/year-zero-making-zinedine-zidane-juventus-199697?page=0%2C1 |title=Year Zero: The making of Zinedine Zidane (Juventus, 1996/97) |publisher=FourFourTwo |last1=Bandini |first1=Paolo |date=3 May 2017 |access-date=25 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025075917/https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/year-zero-making-zinedine-zidane-juventus-199697%3Fpage%3D0,1 |archive-date=25 October 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="scudiero">{{cite news |url=https://www.repubblica.it/online/campionato/shevazida/shevazida/shevazida.html |title=Zidane vede il Pallone d'oro ma Sheva è il suo scudiero |work=La Repubblica |language=it |last1=Vincenzi |first1=Massimo |date=4 December 2000 |access-date=25 October 2019 }}</ref> [[Louisa Cadamuro|Nécib]],<ref name="necib_cbc">{{cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/fifawomensworldcup2011/blog/2011/07/more-to-come-from-louisa-necib.html | title = More to come from Louisa Necib | date = 14 July 2011 | work = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] | access-date = 11 September 2011 | language = fr}}</ref> or [[Juan Román Riquelme]].<ref name="go-to man">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jun/18/worldcup2006.sport8 |title=Lonesome Riquelme is the go-to man |work=The Guardian |author1=Jason Cowley |date=18 June 2006 |access-date=16 March 2019 }}</ref> Creativity, skill, vision, technique, tactical awareness and good passing ability are the true requirements of a good playmaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-analysis.com/the-regista-and-the-evolution-of-the-playmaker/|title=The Regista And the Evolution Of The Playmaker|work=Football Analysis|author1=Ebrahim Sadien|date=5 July 2013|access-date=6 July 2015|archive-date=7 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107185452/http://www.football-analysis.com/the-regista-and-the-evolution-of-the-playmaker/|url-status=dead}}</ref> With the increasing physical and athletic demands of modern football, it has also become increasingly common for midfield playmakers, in particular those who are known for their dynamism, ability to read the game, and work-rate off the ball, to play in deeper roles and be given more defensive responsibilities, in addition to their creative duties: midfielders such as [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]], [[Toni Kroos]], and [[Paul Pogba]] often play in the centre of the pitch and occupy multiple roles, functioning both as box-to-box midfielders and creators, usually dropping back and helping to press opponents and win back possession, and then subsequently either carrying the ball forward, or dictating play and starting an attack with their vision, technique, and passing.<ref name="The modern role of the playmaker"/>

According to [[Jonathan Wilson (writer)|Jonathan Wilson]], Luka Modrić is another example of a midfielder who occupies multiple roles on the pitch; although he initially started out as an attacking midfielder at [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]], he was moved into a deeper central midfield playmaking role during his time with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]], which enabled him to conduct the attack and create chances for teammates.<ref name="WhoscoredAsset11">{{cite news|url=https://www.whoscored.com/Articles/yJdnBMtCW0WN_pmJ7bcMfQ/Show/How-Luka-Modrics-Contribution-Makes-him-Tottenhams-Irreplaceable-Asset|title=How Luka Modric's Contribution Makes him Tottenham's Irreplaceable Asset|first=Chris|last=Davie|date=20 June 2011|publisher=WhoScored.com|access-date=14 July 2017}}</ref> He continued to play in a deeper midfield role in [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]]'s 4–2–3–1 system. However, Wilson has noted that, although Modrić seemingly plays as a holding midfielder, he is "neither entirely destructive or creative", but a "carrier" who is "capable of making late runs or carrying the ball at his feet", but in his case "with a hint of ''regista''".<ref name="changing role of holding midfielders">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/dec/18/question-holding-midfielders-changing-role|title=The Question: what does the changing role of holding midfielders tell us?|first=Jonathan|last=Wilson|author-link=Jonathan Wilson (writer)|date=18 December 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=15 July 2017}}</ref>

Advanced playmakers can also operate on the [[Midfielder#Winger|wings]], in more of a [[Forward (association football)#Winger|wide offensive position]], as a [[Midfielder#Mezzala|half-winger]], [[inverted winger]], or also as an [[Outside-forward|outside]] [[Forward (association football)|forward]], in a 4–3–3 or a 4–2–3–1 formation. This position has become more common for offensive playmakers to carry out in recent years, as formations that employ a purely attacking playmaker, such as the 4–3–1–2/4–1–2–1–2, can often cause teams defensive problems when possession is lost, as attacking midfielders are not usually renowned for their defensive contribution, although modern playmakers are often more tactically responsible in this respect than classical playmakers. This position also allows players to take on defenders in one on one situations along the flank, cut inside to the centre of the pitch with the ball, and either shoot on goal with their stronger foot, or provide in-swinging lobbed passes or crosses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/26/trequartista-engance-classic-no-10sstruggle/|title=How the 2000s changed tactics #2: Classic Number 10s struggle|website=Zonalmarking.net|access-date=5 January 2015|archive-date=8 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408182809/http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/26/trequartista-engance-classic-no-10sstruggle/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Tactics: the changing role of the playmaker"/><ref name="The Fantasista"/> [[Lionel Messi]], for example, who is naturally left-footed, was initially deployed in this position on the right under his former Barcelona manager [[Frank Rijkaard]], alongside the right-footed [[Ronaldinho]] on the left side of the pitch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/cfa0d296-8672-11e0-9d5c-00144feabdc0 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221211/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/cfa0d296-8672-11e0-9d5c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1xRQZ4Y00 |archive-date=2022-12-11 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Lionel Messi|access-date=5 January 2015}}</ref> Some playmakers, such as [[David Beckham]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/player/72740.html|title=David Beckham, Great Britain|work=ESPN.co.uk|access-date=7 July 2015}}</ref> even operate as a [[wide midfielder]] in a 4–4–2, using their vision to find teammates making runs, to whom they can then deliver long passes and [[Curl (football)|curling]] [[Cross (football)|crosses]], although this position of a "pure [[Winger (association football)|winger]]" has become less common in modern formations.<ref name="The Fantasista"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.givemesport.com/363799-the-decline-of-the-oldfashioned-winger|title=The decline of the old-fashioned winger|website=givemesport.com|author1=Colman Corrigan|access-date=6 July 2015|archive-date=7 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707020939/http://www.givemesport.com/363799-the-decline-of-the-oldfashioned-winger|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Nine and a half===

}}

There are also other similar variants upon the advanced playmaking role. Other advanced playmakers seemingly operate as a free, creative [[second striker]], or [[inside-forward]], often playing on the wing, alongside a main striker, or even down the centre of the pitch, and then falling back into a deeper role to link up the midfield and the attack.<ref name="Mancini: THE NUMBER 10"/> Attacking midfielder/playmaker Michel Platini would describe this more advanced creative role (exemplified by Roberto Baggio) as a nine and a half ("nove e mezzo", in Italian), as it was halfway between the role of a goalscoring forward ([[Squad number (association football)|shirt number 9]]) and a playmaking attacking midfielder (shirt number 10).<ref name="Platini: Baggio, Il Fu Nove E Mezzo"/>

This free position allowed these mobile, creative, and technical players, who were also often gifted with an eye for goal as well as good vision, acceleration, and ball skills, the freedom to burst forward suddenly and make dribbling runs, drop deep to lose their markers and pick up the ball, link-up with teammates, and score many goals themselves as well as assisting them. Unlike a pure number ten playmaker, however, the nine and a half/supporting forward does not usually participate in the build-up play as much as an attacking midfielder would. Their role is primarily that of an assist-provider, who can play one-twos as well as hold up and lay-off the ball for more offensive teammates. As the supporting forward initially originated from free-role attacking midfielders adapting to a more advanced position in the tactically rigorous 4–4–2 formations of the 1990s, in which they were often paired up with a more physically gifted out-and-out striker, their defensive contribution is also usually higher than that of a pure number ten playmaker.<ref name="Platini: Baggio, Il Fu Nove E Mezzo">{{cite web|url=http://www.eatsport.net/2012/roberto-baggio-il-nove-e-mezzo/|title=Platini: Baggio, Il Fu Nove E Mezzo|language=it|access-date=16 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604152313/http://www.eatsport.net/2012/roberto-baggio-il-nove-e-mezzo/|archive-date=4 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197254.stm |title=Positions guide: Behind the striker |date=September 2005 |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=25 October 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/96186/rise-seconda-punta |title=Rise of the Seconda Punta |publisher=Football Italia |last1=Murray |first1=Greg |date=29 December 2016 |access-date=9 January 2020 }}</ref>

===False nine===
[[File:039 men at work UEFA 2009, Rome.jpg|thumb|[[Lionel Messi]] (left, 10) has been a leading exponent of the [[false 9]] position.]]

A variation upon the [[deep-lying forward]], more commonly known as a "[[false 9]]" also shares some similarities with the attacking midfielder role, although the false-9 player appears to be playing as a [[centre forward]] rather than as an attacking midfielder. A false-9 is often a quick, nimble, diminutive, creative, and technical player, with good vision, movement, positioning, and passing ability, as well as a penchant for scoring goals. The false-9, seemingly playing as a lone [[Striker (association football)|striker]], will drop deep into the midfield number 10 role, drawing defenders with them, and creating space for other teammates to make attacking runs. This allows the false-9 space to dribble with the ball and score, or to provide other players running into the space they created with assists. Examples of false-9s are Lionel Messi under Pep Guardiola, [[Tito Vilanova]] and [[Gerardo Martino]] at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Cesc Fàbregas]] with [[Spain national football team|Spain]] under [[Vicente del Bosque]], [[Francesco Totti]] at [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] under [[Luciano Spalletti]] and [[Rudi Garcia]], and [[Roberto Firmino]] under [[Jürgen Klopp|Jurgen Klopp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefalse9.blogspot.ca/2012/04/guardiolas-barcelona-reinventing-total.html|title=Barcelona's False-9|work=The False 9|access-date=15 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910104924/http://thefalse9.blogspot.ca/2012/04/guardiolas-barcelona-reinventing-total.html|archive-date=10 September 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theirtactics.com/was-guardiola-trying-to-replicate-roma%E2%80%99s-resplendent-2007-striker-less-formation-under-luciano-spalletti/|title=Was Guardiola trying to replicate Roma's resplendent 2007 striker-less formation under Luciano Spalletti?|website=Theirtactics.com|access-date=15 June 2012|archive-date=18 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018185835/http://www.theirtactics.com/was-guardiola-trying-to-replicate-roma%E2%80%99s-resplendent-2007-striker-less-formation-under-luciano-spalletti/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/what-makes-liverpool-tick-club-world-cup|title=FIFA Club World Cup 2019 - News - What makes Liverpool tick? |last=FIFA.com|website=www.fifa.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> This position is most common in a 4–6–0 formation disguised as a 4–3–3 or 4–2–3–1 formation.<ref name="The False-10">{{cite web|url=http://www.tomwfootball.com/2010/06/16/world-cup-tactics-after-the-false-nine-the-false-10/|title=The False-10|website=Tomwfootball.com|access-date=16 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111005139/http://www.tomwfootball.com/2010/06/16/world-cup-tactics-after-the-false-nine-the-false-10/|archive-date=11 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In Italian football jargon, this role is known as the "centravanti di manovra" (which literally translates to "manoeuvring centre-forward").<ref>{{cite news |url=https://torino.corriere.it/sport/19_dicembre_04/dopo-belotti-b-toro-berenguer-1668ae5c-16c9-11ea-b17e-02f19725a806.shtml |title=Dopo Belotti, la B del Toro è Berenguer |work=Il Corriere della Sera |language=it |last1=Balice |first1=Nicola |date=4 December 2019 |access-date=9 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.tuttosport.com/news/calcio/serie-a/2019/12/04-64146061/la_riscoperta_del_vero_n_9/ |title=La riscoperta del vero n.9 |work=Tutto Sport |language=it |last1=Vocalelli |first1=Alessandro |date=4 December 2019 |access-date=9 April 2020 }}</ref>

===False ten===
[[File:Wesley Sneijder Inter.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Wesley Sneijder]] – pictured playing for [[Inter Milan]] in 2010 – has been deployed as a [[false 10]] on occasion.]]

In addition to their creative responsibilities while in possession, in the modern game, advanced playmakers are also given more duties off the ball than in the past, and are also required to have a higher defensive work-rate; as such, the role of the number 10 has changed in recent years, and formations that utilise a traditional advanced playmaker have become less common. In formations that still do employ an attacking midfielder, however, the number 10 role has instead been described as the "[[false 10]]" role (or sometimes it is even described as that of a "central winger"). The false-10 also shares similar attributes to a false-9, and is often used in a 4–2–3–1 formation. A false-10 is also usually a quick, offensive, technical and creative player, who is apparently playing in deeper role than a false-9 however, usually starting in the attacking midfielder position behind the striker, or occasionally as a winger, as the role is often interpreted by players who naturally play in these positions. As such, the false-10 is often a more dynamic rather than static player, who is tasked with pulling opponents out of position with their movement; indeed, the false-10 will often surprise defenders by moving out of position, drifting out wide, onto the wing, creating space for other players, in particular the full-backs and midfielders, to make attacking runs, either by overloading the flanks, or by drawing opponents out of position. The false 10 will then advance along the flank and provide deliveries into the box for teammates, or pass the ball to a free teammate who is exploiting the newly created space, either on the wing or in the centre. Defensively, they will often participate in their team's pressing game in order to help win back possession; they may also be tasked with finding gaps in the opposing defence and making late runs into the penalty box themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimouomo.com/dizionario-tattico-il-trequartista/ |title=Dizionario tattico: il trequartista |publisher=www.ultimouomo.com |language=it |last1=Barcellona |first1=Fabio |date=31 July 2017 |access-date=9 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/12/03/introducing-the-central-winger/|title=Introducing…the central winger?|website=Zonalmarking.net|access-date=4 January 2015|archive-date=7 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107203917/http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/12/03/introducing-the-central-winger/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The false-10 can also function alongside a false-9 on occasion, in a 4–3–3 (4–6–0) formation, or in a 4–2–3–1 formation. When other forwards or false-9s draw defenders away from the false-10s, creating space in the middle of the pitch, the false-10 will then also surprise defenders by moving out of position once again, often undertaking offensive dribbling runs forward, or running on to passes from false-9s, leading to goals and assists.<ref name="The False-10"/> This role was effectively demonstrated by [[Wesley Sneijder]] and [[Mesut Özil]] during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name="The False-10"/>

===False attacking midfielder===
[[File:Singapore Selection vs Juventus - 2014 - Leonardo Bonucci.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Leonardo Bonucci]] has often functioned as a ball-playing centre-back throughout his career.]]

The false-10 (or [[false attacking midfielder]]) description has also been used in a slightly different manner in [[Italian football]]. The false attacking-midfielder is therefore usually a technical, mobile, and creative player with good vision, positioning, ball control and long passing ability, as well as being a player with respectable defensive attributes, and good long distance shooting ability. The false-10 performs in a similar manner to the false-9, although seemingly playing in the number 10 role, but still drawing opposition players back into the midfield. The false-10 will eventually sit in a central midfield role and function as a deep-lying playmaker, creating space for other players to make attacking runs and receive long passes from the midfield playmakers. In addition to their creative duties, the false attacking midfielder is also often tasked with dropping deep into midfield to assist their team defensively and help retrieved possession.<ref name="Horncastle: Riccardo Montolivo straddles both sides of the Germany/Italy divide">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thescore.com/counterattack/2012/06/28/horncastle-riccardo-montolivo-straddles-both-sides-of-the-germanyitaly-divide/|title=Horncastle: Riccardo Montolivo straddles both sides of the Germany/Italy divide|work=The Score|author=James Horncastle|access-date=20 August 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140820165844/http://blogs.thescore.com/counterattack/2012/06/28/horncastle-riccardo-montolivo-straddles-both-sides-of-the-germanyitaly-divide/|archive-date=20 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/dec/20/football-tactical-trends-of-2011 |title=The football tactical trends of 2011 |work=the Guardian |last=Wilson |first=Jonathan |date=20 December 2011 |access-date=17 April 2022 }}</ref>

===False winger===
The "false winger" or "seven–and–a–half" is instead a label which has been used to describe a creative type of player who normally plays centrally, but who instead is deployed out wide on paper; during the course of a match, however, they will move inside and operate in the centre of the pitch, in order to drag defenders out of position, congest the midfield and give their team a numerical advantage in this area, so that they can dictate play with their passing, dominate possession in the middle of the pitch, and create chances for their attacking teammates; this position also leaves space for full-backs to make overlapping attacking runs up the flank. [[Samir Nasri]], who has been deployed in this role, once described it as that of a "non-axial playmaker."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/name/93/post/1839728/headline |title=Roberto Soldado perfectly anchors AVB's 'vertical' football |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Cox |first1=Michael |date=6 August 2013 |access-date=15 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/english-premier-league/23/blog/post/2998241/manchester-united-must-play-paul-pogba-in-his-best-position-to-get-the-most-from-him |title=Man United must play Paul Pogba in best position to get the most from him |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Cox |first1=Michael |date=18 November 2016 |access-date=15 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/man-united-meet-henrikh-mkhitaryan-one-man-arsenal-wholl-give-your-attack-a-new-lease-life |title=Man United, meet Miki: The one-man arsenal who'll revitalise your attack |publisher=FourFourTwo |last1=Baldi |first1=Ryan |date=1 July 2016 |access-date=15 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-england-liverpool-united/analysis-soccer-van-gaals-tactical-wits-edge-battle-of-the-bosses-idUKL3N0WN0AT20150322 |title=ANALYSIS-Soccer-Van Gaal's tactical wits edge battle of the bosses |work=Reuters |last1=Davis |first1=Toby |date=22 March 2015 |access-date=15 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/long-read-guardiolas-16-point-blueprint-dominance-his-methods-management-and-tactics |title=The long read: Guardiola's 16-point blueprint for dominance - his methods, management and tactics |publisher=FourFourTwo |last1=Murray |first1=Andrew |date=16 August 2016 |access-date=15 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@Discussion_Dave/julian-weigl-the-modern-day-regista-3586684bf2cc |title=Julian Weigl: The Modern Day Regista |publisher=Medium |last1=Ndiyo |first1=David |date=3 August 2017 |access-date=15 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2511694-the-tactical-evolution-of-arsenal-midfielder-santi-cazorla |title=The Tactical Evolution of Arsenal Midfielder Santi Cazorla |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=McNicholas |first1=James |date=1 July 2015 |access-date=17 May 2020 }}</ref>

==Qualities of a good playmaker==
[[File:Football against poverty 2014 - Marta.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Brazilian playmaker [[Marta (footballer)|Marta]] is known for her technical skills in addition to her ability to score goals and create chances for teammates.]]

Perhaps the most important quality of a playmaker is the vision and ability to read the game, and to get into good positions making for effective reception and distribution of the ball. Intuition and creativity are other key elements of a playmaker's game, as they need to know where different players are at different times, without taking too long to dwell on the ball. A good playmaker possesses good ball control, balance, technical ability, and dribbling skills, and will often hold possession, allowing other team members to make attacking runs. The ostensible role of the playmaker is to then provide or facilitate the final pass which leads to a goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fm-tactics.co.uk/index.php?page=articles&view=article&news_id=95|title=FM-Tactics – Brought to you by Football Manager Britain<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Fm-tactics.co.uk|access-date=20 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206100706/http://www.fm-tactics.co.uk/index.php?page=articles&view=article&news_id=95|archive-date=6 February 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> In football terminology, this is often known as a ''killer ball'' or the ''final ball'', and is officially recorded as an [[assist (football)|assist]].

[[Attacking midfielder|Advanced playmakers]] are often known for their ability to score goals as well as their technical skills, passing, and chance creation ability. They are often – but not always – quick, agile, and mobile players, with good tactical intelligence; their movement off the ball is just as important as their movement on the ball, as they must create space for further attacking plays. Many playmakers are also [[Direct free kick|free-kick]], [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]], and [[Set piece (football)|dead-ball]] specialists, who are also capable of [[Curl (football)|curling]] the ball into the box from set pieces, providing further deliveries for teammates, although this is not necessarily a trait that is required to be a playmaker.<ref name="Mancini: THE NUMBER 10"/>

Classical number 10 and deep-lying playmakers are not often renowned for their tackling or defensive capabilities, hence English commentators have often seen them as a luxury in a football team, but they retain their places due to their ability to change games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thesefootballtimes.co/2018/06/18/why-have-england-traditionally-feared-the-fantasista/|title=Why have England traditionally feared the fantasista?|date=18 June 2018|website=Thesefootballtimes.co|access-date=20 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldsoccer.com/columnists/brian-glanville/brian-glanville-on-the-dearth-of-english-playmakers-331278|title=Brian Glanville on the dearth of English playmakers – World Soccer|date=6 September 2011|website=Worldsoccer.com|access-date=20 August 2018}}</ref> Because of this, it became common in the past for [[box-to-box midfielder]]s with good vision, tackling, tactical intelligence, passing and technical ability to play in the playmaker role in England, as shown by various coaches employing players such as Paul Scholes, [[Steven Gerrard]], [[Frank Lampard]], [[Yaya Touré]] and Xabi Alonso in this position.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thesefootballtimes.co/2015/04/19/the-relationship-between-age-and-the-regista/|title=The relationship between age and the regista|website=Thesefootballtimes.co|date=19 April 2015|access-date=20 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theirtactics.com/are-midfield-plungers-the-new-play-makers/|title=Are Midfield Plungers the New Play-makers?|website=Theirtactics.com|access-date=15 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/simonaustin/2011/09/lampard_can_reinvent_himself_a.html |title=Lampard can reinvent himself at Chelsea |publisher=BBC Sport |last1=Austin |first1=Simon |date=25 September 2011 |access-date=16 May 2020 }}</ref> In a 4–4–2 formation, a playmaker will usually play alongside a defensive midfield player to ensure that the team is not vulnerable to attack. With different formations, however, a team may play with multiple playmakers. Most English teams usually use only one playmaker to minimize defensive frailties and also because using more than one may inhibit each playmaker's playing style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/barclays-premier-league/23/blog/post/2935772/premier-league-disappointing-lack-of-deep-lying-playmakers|title=Cox: Lack of deep-lying playmakers in Prem|website=Espn.co.uk|date=23 August 2016|access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/a012437b-d5e7-391a-923b-73310f3e4dbb|archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221211231251/https://www.ft.com/content/a012437b-d5e7-391a-923b-73310f3e4dbb|archive-date=11 December 2022|url-access=subscription|url-status=live|title=English football must stop outsourcing creativity if the national team is to succeed|website=Financial Times|date=10 July 2016|access-date=20 August 2018|last1=Burn-Murdoch|first1=John}}</ref> The downside to this approach is that a team lacks the necessary creativity when faced with a defensive opponent.

[[Carlo Mazzone]] and [[Carlo Ancelotti]] were known for having been able to adopt their formations to allow them to implement various playmakers into their starting formation. At [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]], Mazzone moved Andrea Pirlo, originally an attacking midfielder, into the deep-lying role behind the midfield, whilst Roberto Baggio played the attacking midfielder role.<ref name="Mancini: THE NUMBER 10"/> For [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], Ancelotti made a similar move, also employing Pirlo as a deep-lying playmaker, allowing [[Rivaldo]] or [[Rui Costa]], and later [[Kaká]], to play as an attacking midfielder, whilst [[Clarence Seedorf]] and either [[Gennaro Gattuso]] or [[Massimo Ambrosini]] protected them defensively in Ancelotti's 4–4–2 midfield diamond formation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theirtactics.com/two-years-into-the-mourinho-project-and-a-league-trophy-to-show-where-does-madrid-go-from-here/|title=Two years into the Mourinho project and a league trophy to show- Where does Madrid go from here?|website=Theirtactics.com|access-date=15 May 2012}}</ref> Due to the strength of Milan's midfield during his tenure with the club, Ancelotti was able to win several domestic and international titles. [[Marcello Lippi]] also utilised two playmakers during Italy's victorious [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] campaign, fielding Francesco Totti in the advanced creative role behind the forwards, and Pirlo in the deep-lying playmaking role. The two playmakers were supported defensively by box-to-box midfielders, such as Daniele De Rossi, Gennaro Gattuso and [[Simone Perrotta]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blitzquotidiano.it/sport/italia-2006-campioni-del-mondo-grosso-jolly-cannavaro-buffon-voto-simpatia-75-1883864/|title=Italia 2006: campioni del mondo.

[[File:Totti 2011 crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Italian attacking midfield playmaker [[Francesco Totti]] spent his entire career with [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], also serving as the team's [[Captain (association football)|captain]].]]

Former Italy manager [[Ferruccio Valcareggi]], however, devised a different strategy altogether, which allowed him to use two playmakers during his run to the [[1970 FIFA World Cup Final|1970 World Cup final]], where Italy was ultimately heavily defeated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil.]] Due to his focus on defensive stability, as well as the presence of two pure, prolific goalscoring strikers, [[Gigi Riva]] and [[Roberto Boninsegna]], Valcareggi felt that it would not be possible to field Italy's two most revered advanced playmakers at the time, [[Gianni Rivera]], and [[Sandro Mazzola]], alongside each other. He believed the two creative players to be incompatible with each other, due to the [[Derby della Madonnina|rivalry between their respective clubs]], and as he felt that deploying both players alongside the forwards would offset the balance within the starting line-up, in particular as Rivera, unlike Mazzola, was not renowned for his athleticism or defensive work-rate. He therefore conceived the infamous "staffetta" ([[Relay race|relay]]) game-plan, which essentially consisted of Mazzola playing the first half of each match, whilst Rivera would play the second half; during Valcareggi's eight-year tenure with Italy, the national side only lost six matches. Despite Italy's victory at [[UEFA Euro 1968]] and their second-place finish at the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], the tactic was widely criticised by the media, in particular due to Italy's poor performance during the group-stage and in the final, despite demonstrating their ability to successfully apply a more offensive, exciting style of play with Rivera in the [[Game of the Century (football)|semi-final]] against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/6_minuti_rivera.html|title=Messico 70 e quei sei minuti di Rivera|work=Storie di Calcio|language=it|access-date=13 January 2015}}</ref> During the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], Italy manager [[Cesare Maldini]] underwent similar widespread media criticism for employing a strategy reminiscent of the 1970 "staffetta" between Roberto Baggio and [[Alessandro Del Piero]], who alternated occupying the creative second striker role, alongside an out-and-out striker or centre-forward (usually [[Christian Vieri]] or occasionally [[Filippo Inzaghi]]) in a 4–4–2 formation;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/sport/scelta/scelta/scelta.html?ref=search|title=Maldini sceglie Baggio, ma Alex vuole il posto|work=La Repubblica|language=it|last=Currò|first=Enrico|date=15 June 1998|access-date=13 January 2015}}</ref> manager [[Giovanni Trapattoni]] was also initially criticised for not fielding playmakers Francesco Totti and Del Piero alongside each other during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archivio.panorama.it/archivio/I-dubbi-del-Trap-Del-Piero-Totti-insieme|title=I dubbi del Trap Del Piero-Totti insieme?|work=Panorama|language=it|access-date=13 January 2015}}</ref>

During his run to the [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] [[UEFA Euro 2012 Final|final]] and the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]] semi-finals, the former Italy coach [[Cesare Prandelli]] also used several playmakers in his squad; he often deployed either [[Riccardo Montolivo]], [[Alberto Aquilani]], Daniele De Rossi, [[Antonio Nocerino]] or [[Thiago Motta]] in the false 10 playmaking role, as well as in other midfield positions, in his 4–3–1–2 formation; this formation was devoid of an authentic attacking midfielder, and was centred on the midfielders constantly switching positions. Prandelli's midfield was focussed on the creative playmaking of Andrea Pirlo and Montolivo in their deep-lying playmaker and false attacking midfield roles, with Pirlo seemingly being deployed as a defensive midfielder in front of the defense, in order to be left with more time on the ball, in an "inverted" midfield diamond (4–1–3–2). Pirlo was supported defensively by dynamic box-to-box midfielders, such as [[Claudio Marchisio]] and De Rossi, due to his lack of pace or notable defensive ability. The space created by the movement of Montolivo as the false 10 allowed quicker, more offensive minded midfielders, such as Marchisio, to make attacking runs in order to receive Pirlo and Montolivo's long passes from the midfield, whilst the second striker [[Antonio Cassano]] would drop out wide onto the wing or into the attacking midfielder position to link up the play between the attack and midfield. As well as functioning as a playmaker, and creating space, in the false 10 role, Montolivo was also able to alleviate the pressure placed upon Pirlo in the deep lying playmaker role, by supporting him defensively and providing Pirlo and the team with a secondary creative option.<ref name="Horncastle: Riccardo Montolivo straddles both sides of the Germany/Italy divide"/>

Although [[Helenio Herrera]]'s famous [[catenaccio]] tactics during the years of "[[La Grande Inter]]" in the 1960s were primarily thought to be associated with defensive yet effective football,<ref name=Obituary>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obitaury-helenio-herrera-1293412.html |title=Obituary: Helenio Herrera |work=The Independent |location=UK |first=Norman |last=Fox |date= 11 November 1997|access-date=22 April 2011 }}</ref> creative playmakers played a fundamental part in [[Inter Milan]]'s success during this period. Herrera and former Grande Inter players, including Mazzola and Facchetti, would state that they felt the Grande Inter side to be more offensive than it was often made out to be, and that imitators of Herrera's catenaccio tactics had often replicated his pragmatic style of football imperfectly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/707/431/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222165048/http://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/707/431/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 22, 2014|title=Mazzola: Inter is my second family|website=FIFA.com|access-date=11 September 2014}}</ref> [[Luis Suárez (footballer, born 1935)|Luis Suárez]] (formerly an offensive playmaker who had first flourished under Herrera's more fluid, offensive tactics at Barcelona) was the primary creative force of Herrera's Inter side, functioning as a deep-lying playmaker, due to his ball skills, vision and passing range.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1606149-great-team-tactics-breaking-down-helenio-herreras-la-grande-inter|title=Great Team Tactics: Breaking Down Helenio Herrera's 'La Grande Inter'|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref> [[Sandro Mazzola]], in the role of a winger, attacking midfielder, inside-right or supporting striker, and [[Armando Picchi]] in the Libero or [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]] position, would also function as secondary playmakers at times, as well as left-winger [[Mario Corso]]. Aside from the strength of the almost impenetrable defence, some of the key elements of Herrera's Inter side were the use of vertical football and very quick, efficient and spectacular [[counter-attacks]], which would lead to goals being scored with very few touches and passes.<ref name="Helenio Herrera: More than just catenaccio">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/coaches/coach=61622/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911103050/http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/coaches/coach=61622/|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 11, 2014|title=Helenio Herrera: More than just catenaccio|website=FIFA.com|access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref> This was made possible due to Herrera's use of very quick, energetic, offensive, two-way full-backs to launch counter-attacks, such as [[Giacinto Facchetti]], and [[Tarcisio Burgnich]].<ref name="Helenio Herrera: More than just catenaccio"/>

The quick, energetic technical wingers ([[Jair da Costa]] and [[Mario Corso]]) and offensive midfielder/supporting striker (Mazzola), would also occasionally move into deeper positions to support the midfield creatively and defensively, leaving the fullbacks with space to attack, which frequently caught the opposing teams by surprise. In Herrera's flexible 5–3–2 formation at Inter, four man-marking defenders were tightly assigned to each opposing attacker while an extra sweeper would recover loose balls and double mark when necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sempreinter.com/2012/10/15/la-grande-inter-helenio-herrera-1910-1997-il-mago/|title=La Grande Inter: Helenio Herrera (1910-1997) – "Il Mago"|work=Sempre Inter|date=15 October 2012|language=it|access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref> Under Herrera, most frequently during away matches in Europe, the highly organised and disciplined Inter players would usually defend by sitting patiently behind the ball, often leading to very closely contested victories. Upon winning back possession, Picchi, usually a traditional and defensive minded sweeper, would often advance into the midfield, and occasionally play long balls to the forwards, or, more frequently, carry the ball and play it towards Luis Suárez, whose playmaking ability played a crucial role in Inter's adeptness at counter-attacking football. Due to Suárez's outstanding vision and passing ability, he could quickly launch the forwards or full-backs on counter-attacks with quick long passes once he had received the ball, usually allowing the fullbacks to advance towards goal and score, or to help create goal-scoring chances.<ref name="Helenio Herrera: More than just catenaccio"/> Under Herrera, Inter won three [[Serie A]] titles (two of them won consecutively), two consecutive [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]] and two consecutive [[Intercontinental Cup (1960–2004)|Intercontinental Cups]], and he was given the nickname "''Il Mago''" due to his success and tactical prowess.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inter.it/it/societa/storia2005-2.html |title=La leggenda della Grande Inter|trans-title=The legend of the Grande Inter|website=Inter.it|language=it|access-date=10 September 2014 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019213304/http://www.inter.it/it/societa/storia2005-2.html|archive-date=19 October 2012}}</ref>

During his highly successful spell as the head coach of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], Pep Guardiola was able to incorporate several skillful players with playmaker qualities into his team, such as Xavi, [[Andrés Iniesta]], [[Sergio Busquets]], Cesc Fàbregas and Lionel Messi, through the use of his personal variation on ''[[tiki-taka]]'' tactics, allowing the team to move the ball around, switch positions, create space by making attacking runs, and retain possession. His use of heavy pressing in his 4–3–3 formation gave each player defensive responsibilities when possession was lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theirtactics.com/comparing-marcelo-bielsa-to-pep-guardiola/|title=Comparing Marcelo Bielsa to Pep Guardiola|website=Theirtactics.com|access-date=15 May 2012}}</ref> Guardiola also frequently deployed Messi in the false-9 role, which was particularly effective due to the frequency of attacking runs made by the Barcelona players, as well as their disciplined positioning, team-work, vision, technical skills, creativity, and passing ability, which allowed Messi to create and score several goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1802653-complete-guide-to-the-false-9-and-who-plays-it-best|title=Complete Guide to the False 9 and Who Plays It Best|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=20 August 2014}}</ref>

Vicente del Bosque also incorporated similar tactics (such as the use of ''tiki-taka'', heavy pressing and the false-9 in a 4–3–3 or 4–6–0 formation) during his successful run of reaching three consecutive international finals as Spain's manager, between [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] and [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup|2013]], winning the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012]].
