{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2022}}
In [[association football]], the '''panenka''' is a technique used while taking a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] in which the taker, instead of kicking the ball to the left or right of the goalkeeper, gives a light touch underneath the ball, causing it to rise and fall within the centre of the goal, deceiving the goalkeeper who will most likely have committed to a dive away from the centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/crgglxwge10o|title=Antonin Panenka: The Euro 1976 penalty that killed a career and birthed a feud|date=27 June 2024|website=BBC Sport}}</ref>

The technique was pioneered by Czech player [[Antonín Panenka]] when he scored the winning goal in the [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] that decided the [[UEFA Euro 1976]] [[UEFA Euro 1976 Final|final]] in [[Belgrade]], beating West German goalkeeper [[Sepp Maier]] to claim the title for the [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia national team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/31/theknowledge.sport|title=The footballers who have moves named after them|website=[[TheGuardian.com]] |date=31 October 2007 |access-date=2010-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002152402/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/31/theknowledge.sport|archive-date=2013-10-02|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=“Radio”>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/czechstoday/antonin-panenka-the-footballer-pele-described-as-either-a-genius-or-a-madman|title=Antonin Panenka - the footballer Pele described as "either a genius or a madman"|date=20 June 2007 |access-date=2010-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209025811/http://www.radio.cz/en/section/czechstoday/antonin-panenka-the-footballer-pele-described-as-either-a-genius-or-a-madman|archive-date=2011-02-09|url-status=live}}</ref> The technique garnered Panenka much media attention and praise, but it was likewise deemed risky. Due to it being difficult to execute correctly and relatively easy to save for the goalkeeper if anticipated, a ''panenka'' has rarely been attempted at professional knock-out tournaments. Sports journalists have noted that generally only highly regarded players who can deal with the consequences of missing such an attempt, have tried scoring with a ''panenka'' at major tournaments.<ref name="Pirlo's courage">{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/soccer/2012/06/25/euro_2012_pirlos_courage_to_kick_a_penalty_like_panenka_helped_italys_42_win_over_england.html|title=Euro 2012: Pirlo's courage to kick a penalty like Panenka helped Italy's 4-2 win over England|work=The Star|date=25 June 2012 |access-date=2017-09-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817163244/https://www.thestar.com/sports/soccer/2012/06/25/euro_2012_pirlos_courage_to_kick_a_penalty_like_panenka_helped_italys_42_win_over_england.html|archive-date=2017-08-17|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/andrea-pirlo-panenka-penalty-andrea-3416154|title=Andrea Pirlo explains THAT Panenka penalty which bamboozled Joe Hart at Euro 2012|date=15 April 2014 |publisher=The Mirror|access-date=2018-04-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114215820/http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/andrea-pirlo-panenka-penalty-andrea-3416154|archive-date=2018-01-14|url-status=live}}</ref> 

Originally, the [[Czech language|Czech]] name for ''panenka'' was ''Vršovický dloubák'' — a reference to the [[Prague]] district of [[Vršovice]], where Panenka's home club [[Bohemians 1905|Bohemians]] is based. This style of penalty kick is also called ''Il cucchiaio'' ('the spoon') in Italy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/il-rigore-di-panenka.html|title=Il rigore di Panenka|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=it|access-date=9 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521141332/http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/il-rigore-di-panenka.html|archive-date=21 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> ''cavadinha'' ('little dig') in Brazil and ''penal picado'' ('poked penalty kick') in Argentina and elsewhere in South America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pasionfutbol.com/noticias/Como-nacio-el-penal-picado-a-lo-Panenka-20140307-0053.html|title=¿Cómo nació el penal picado a lo Panenka?|publisher=Pasión Fútbol|access-date=2019-05-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190505175043/https://www.pasionfutbol.com/noticias/Como-nacio-el-penal-picado-a-lo-Panenka-20140307-0053.html|archive-date=2019-05-05|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Technique ==
The aim of the technique is not to [[Chip (association football)|chip]] the ball over the goalkeeper, but to take advantage of the fact that many goalkeepers will dive to either side of the goal in anticipation, rather than waiting to see in which direction the ball is going. It is a very risky technique, because the subtle touch on the ball gives it a very slow speed, thus allowing the goalkeeper to move back from where they jumped, or even to simply remain in the same spot and wait for the ball to fall easily into their hands. In addition, the subtle touch is most easily applied by a taker who slows down as they are about to strike the ball, making it possible for the goalkeeper to recognize what the taker is intending. The move is generally only used by confident penalty takers who dare to risk missing the kick.<ref name="Pirlo's courage"/> Some players who have attempted a ''panenka'' have been criticized by the specialized media or their team's members and supporters, especially if they miss it.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-03|title=14 of the best and worst Panenkas ever|url=https://www.planetfootball.com/quick-reads/good-bad-ugly-panenkas-pirlo-crouch-ramsey/|access-date=2020-09-23|website=Planet Football|language=en-US|archive-date=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231072657/https://www.planetfootball.com/quick-reads/good-bad-ugly-panenkas-pirlo-crouch-ramsey/|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to studies, a ''panenka'' has a lower scoring probability over placement or power, though it is alleged that if successful, a ''panenka'''s psychological impact on the opposite team may be profound, which may be why penalty takers elect to use it.{{fact|date=August 2024}} In the penalty shootout in Italy's game against England in [[Euro 2012]], [[Andrea Pirlo]] opted for a ''panenka'' specifically in the hope of inflicting a psychological blow on England.<ref>{{cite web |title=Andrea Pirlo Panenka penalty: Andrea Pirlo explains that spot kick that bamboozled Joe Hart at Euro 2012 |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/andrea-pirlo-panenka-penalty-andrea-3416154 |website=Mirror Online |date=April 15, 2014 |first=Alex |last=Richards |access-date=March 10, 2023 |archive-date=14 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114215820/http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/andrea-pirlo-panenka-penalty-andrea-3416154 |url-status=live }}</ref> Antonín Panenka, though, saw the penalty as a reflection of his own personality.<ref name=aguero>{{Cite news |title=Was Aguero's Panenka really a mistake?

[[Antonín Panenka]] came to international prominence playing for [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] in the [[1976 European Football Championship|1976 European Championship]]; Czechoslovakia reached the [[UEFA Euro 1976 Final|final]], where they faced [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]. After [[extra time]], the result was 2–2, and so the first [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] in a European Championships final ensued. The first seven kicks were converted, until West Germany's fourth penalty taker, [[Uli Hoeneß]], ballooned his shot over the bar. With the score 4–3, Panenka stepped up to take the fifth Czechoslovak penalty, which would win the match if he scored. He [[Dummy (football)|feigned]] shooting to the side of the goal, causing West German goalkeeper [[Sepp Maier]] to dive to his left, and then gently chipped the ball into the middle of the net.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/31/theknowledge.sport|title=Football - Knowledge: the footballers who have moves named after them|author=Tom Bryant|work=the Guardian|date=31 October 2007 |access-date=2016-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221100718/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/31/theknowledge.sport|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=live}}</ref> The perceived impudence of the shot, in addition to its success, led a watching French journalist to dub Panenka "a poet".

=== Since 1976 ===
[[File:Antonín Panenka 2013.JPG|thumb|Panenka in 2013. His original penalty technique has been imitated by many other players.]]

As well as winning the 1976 European Championship, Panenka helped Czechoslovakia come third in the [[1980 European Football Championship|1980 tournament]], after scoring once again in a 9–8 penalty shootout win.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/history/news/0254-0d7b2e1aee41-3ae60f7e2fc4-1000--czechs-beat-hosts-italy-to-euro-1980-bronze-after-shoot-out/|title=UEFA Euro 1980 - History - Czechoslovakia-Italy - UEFA.com|date=4 October 2003|access-date=18 April 2016|publisher=[[UEFA]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505055547/http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1980/matches/round=197/match=3584/postmatch/report/index.html#czechs+dramatic+shoot|archive-date=5 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In the finals of the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]], Panenka scored twice from penalties, but these were the only Czechoslovak goals, and the team did not progress beyond the first group stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/spain1982/statistics/players/goal-scored.html|title=1982 FIFA World Cup Spain - Statistics - Players - Top goals|work=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|access-date=2017-12-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181125074109/https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/spain1982/statistics/players/goal-scored.html|archive-date=2018-11-25|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/spain1982/groups/index.html|title=1982 FIFA World Cup Spain - Groups|work=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|access-date=2017-12-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216224422/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/spain1982/groups/index.html|archive-date=2017-12-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Panenka's penalty has since been successfully emulated by many other players in a wide range of competitions. Only a small number of these have been, like Panenka's original, in major cup finals:

Among other players, [[Sergio Ramos]] is well known for his penchant on regularly using the ''panenka'', most notably during the [[UEFA Euro 2012#Semi-finals|Euro 2012 semi-finals]] against Portugal, and his penalties has been praised by Panenka himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/panenka-proud-sergio-ramos-imitates-his-penalties|title=Panenka proud Sergio Ramos imitates his penalties|website=[[FourFourTwo]] |date=13 November 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/spain/9361390/Euro-2012-Spain-defender-Sergio-Ramos-planned-Panenka-penalty-in-shoot-out-against-Portugal.html|title=Euro 2012: Spain defender Sergio Ramos planned 'Panenka' penalty in shoot-out against Portugal|website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref>

Attempted ''panenkas'' are often unsuccessful. In the [[2019 A-League Grand Final]] [[Perth Glory]] player [[Brendon Santalab]], who had scored multiple ''panenkas'' previously in his career, played his last game as a professional. The match ended in a penalty shootout between Sydney FC and Santalab's club Perth Glory. With Sydney FC leading 3-1, Santalab took Perth's third penalty, attempting a ''panenka'', but Sydney FC goalkeeper [[Andrew Redmayne]] was expecting it. The keeper stood upright and easily saved the weak kick. Sydney FC scored their next penalty, winning the shootout and the A-League Championship 4-1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thewest.com.au/sport/perth-glory/perth-glory-a-league-grand-final-offside-controversy-marrs-first-half-as-teams-deadlocked-ng-b881204487z|title=Perth Glory A-League Grand Final offside controversy|date=2019-05-19|website=The West Australian|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03|archive-date=3 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603021617/https://thewest.com.au/sport/perth-glory/perth-glory-a-league-grand-final-offside-controversy-marrs-first-half-as-teams-deadlocked-ng-b881204487z|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1992, former England captain [[Gary Lineker]] failed a ''panenka'' which at the time, would have put him level with [[Bobby Charlton]] for the England team's top scorer, the missed penalty instead leaving him one goal behind on 48 for the rest of his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/10311538/top-10-panenka-penalties-famous-homages-to-the-iconic-spot-kick|title=Top 10 'Panenka' penalties: Famous homages to the iconic spot-kick|work=[[Sky Sports]]|first=Adam|last=Bate|date=20 June 2016|access-date=15 August 2023|archive-date=15 August 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230815121113/https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/10311538/top-10-panenka-penalties-famous-homages-to-the-iconic-spot-kick|url-status=live}}</ref>

On July 4th, 2024, during the [[2024 Copa América]] quarterfinal match between Argentina and Ecuador, [[Lionel Messi]] missed the opening kick of the penalty shootout when he attempted a ''panenka''. The chip fooled the Ecuadorian goalkeeper, but the ball hit the crossbar and bounced up and back, finally landing on the top of the net. Argentina nevertheless won the penalty shootout 4–2. A few days later, during the tournament's third-place match between Canada and Uruguay, [[Alphonso Davies]] missed the fourth kick of the penalty shootout when he attempted a ''panenka''. The chip convinced the Uruguayan goalkeeper to dive to his left, but the ball hit the crossbar. With that miss, Uruguay ended up winning the penalty shootout 4–3.
