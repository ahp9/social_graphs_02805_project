{{Short description|Sporting achievement}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2021}}
The term '''''sextuple''''' is mainly used in the sports press for winning six important national and international titles in sport, especially in football, within one season or calendar year.

During a football season, clubs typically take part in a number of national competitions, such as in a league and one or more cup competitions, and sometimes in continental competitions. Winning multiple competitions is considered a particularly significant achievement. Doubles and triples tend to be long-remembered achievements, but they occur with a certain frequency, while [[List of association football teams to have won four or more trophies in one season|winning four or more trophies in a season]] is much less common. In the 2010s, the terms quadruple, quintuple, and sextuple were sometimes used to refer to four, five, and six trophies in a single season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.givemesport.com/1531117-on-this-day-in-2009-barcelona-completed-the-only-sextuple-in-history-with-club-world-cup-win|title = On this day in 2009 - Barcelona completed the only 'sextuple' in history|date = 19 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2021/02/15/2009-barcelona-2020-bayern-munich-sextuple-guardiola|title = Comparing sextuples: 2009 Barça vs. 2020 Bayern| date=15 February 2021 }}</ref>

== Sextuple in continental football ==
In terms of football, the sextuple means that if a club can win six official competitions in a row, it has to do so. The performance can be achieved through victories in the same season or calendar year.<ref>{{Cite web |last=UEFA.com |title=Most titles {{!}} History {{!}} UEFA Champions League |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/winners/ |access-date=2022-09-05 |website=[[UEFA]] |language=en}}</ref>

The three national titles in a continent are:
* winning the [[Domestic association football season|national league]]
* winning the [[domestic cup|national cup]]
* winning the [[super cup|national supercup]] and/or winning the [[league cup|national league cup]]
The two international titles in a continent are:
* winning that continent's champions league, such as the [[UEFA Champions League]] in Europe
* winning that continent's super cup, if available, such as the [[UEFA Super Cup]] in Europe
The international title worldwide is:
* winning the [[FIFA Intercontinental Cup]] (previously the annual [[FIFA Club World Cup]] before its restructuring into a quadrennial [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]-like event in 2023)
Currently, only the clubs from the top-flight leagues in [[Confederation of African Football|Africa]], [[UEFA|Europe]] or [[CONMEBOL|South America]] can have a chance to achieve a sextuple, due to the presence of continental super cups in those continents.

== Sextuple winners ==
[[File:Pep Guardiola 2015.jpg|thumb|200x200px|[[Pep Guardiola]], former [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] manager, who achieved the first international sextuple in 2009.]]Currently, [[FC Barcelona]] and [[FC Bayern Munich]] are the only two teams to have achieved the sextuple. Both teams won the only six possible trophies, as neither [[Football in Spain|Spain]] nor [[Football in Germany|Germany]] has a [[league cup]] and the [[FIFA Intercontinental Cup|Intercontinental Cup]] was non-existent at the time.

== Seventh and eighth title ==
On 11 February 2021, just minutes after Bayern Munich won the [[2020 FIFA Club World Cup final|FIFA Club World Cup final]] to secure a sextuple, former Bayern coach [[Pep Guardiola]] jokingly challenged the side to a match against previous sextuple winners Barcelona, a team that was managed by Guardiola at the time. As these two sides were the only ones to have achieved a sextuple in football history, he suggested that they could play for a seventh title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/guardiola-challenges-bayern-munich-to-sextuple-showdown-with-barcelona-14749|title=Pep Guardiola challenges Bayern Munich to sextuple showdown with Barcelona|work=[[Bundesliga]]|date=11 February 2021|access-date=18 April 2021}}</ref>

It is technically possible for certain teams to win seven trophies in a single calendar year; for example, a top-flight English club can win the standard six trophies that are of similar calibre and format to the ones achieved in previous sextuples, but can also add a seventh title by winning the [[EFL Cup]], a secondary national cup in England which does not exist in the many other countries that have only one domestic cup competition. 

Since 2025, there is an opportunity for any European, African or South American top division league club to win seven trophies supplemented by a domestic cup and super cup, as well as an octuple for top-flight clubs in some countries (such as England, Argentina, or Egypt), if they win a [[FIFA Intercontinental Cup]] in the same year in which the revamped [[FIFA Club World Cup]] took place.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Straus |first=Brian |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2023/03/14/fifa-confirms-four-team-groups-2026-world-cup |title=FIFA Confirms Four-Team Groups for 2026 World Cup, New Club World Cup Qualification |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=14 March 2023 |access-date=14 March 2023}}</ref>

[[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] were close to achieving the feat of septuple feat in 1967, when they added a [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] title to their domestic quadruple consisting of the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]], [[Scottish Cup]], secondary [[Scottish League Cup]] and tertiary [[Glasgow Cup]]. However, there was an absence of either a Scottish{{efn|[[Scottish Football Association|Scotland]] has never organized a domestic [[Super cup]]}} or European Super Cup at the time,{{efn|The [[UEFA Super Cup]]'s inaugural competition was in 1973.}} and Celtic's subsequent loss against Argentine side [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]] in the [[1967 Intercontinental Cup]] prevented them from achieving their seventh major honour within the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.givemesport.com/1563826-celtics-196667-team-voted-the-greatest-club-side-of-the-last-century|title=Celtic's 1966/67 team voted the greatest club side of the last century|date=20 April 2020}}</ref>
