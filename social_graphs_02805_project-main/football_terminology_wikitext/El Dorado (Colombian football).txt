{{Italic title|string=El Dorado}}
'''''El Dorado''''' is the name given to an era (1949&ndash;54) of the [[Categoría Primera A|Colombian football league]] during which the league broke away from [[FIFA]]. The [[Colombia national football team|Colombia national team]] and all domestic clubs were banned from international competition during this period, although some authors consider that to have been a "golden age" for Colombian football.<ref name="a">[http://www.eltiempo.com/100/dk100/cronologia_centenario/ARTICULO-WEB-PLANT_NOTA_INTERIOR_100-7821763.html El Tiempo - Colombia entra en la élite del fútbol mundial con 'la época de El Dorado' {{in lang|es}}] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120629014029/http://www.eltiempo.com/100/dk100/cronologia_centenario/ARTICULO-WEB-PLANT_NOTA_INTERIOR_100-7821763.html |date=2012-06-29 }}</ref>

==History==

The Colombia football league turned professional in 1948 and awarded its first championship that year to [[Independiente Santa Fe]]. Internal disputes later that year caused [[DIMAYOR]] to leave the [[Colombian Football Federation]].  In response, [[FIFA]] suspended the league and the national team from all the international tournaments.

Meanwhile, the [[Argentine Football Association]] was dealing with a strike by its players. Several of the most important Argentinian players were looking to leave the country and, as the Colombian league was not affiliated to FIFA, Colombian clubs that wished to sign them were not required to pay transfer fees. Alfonso Senior, the chairman of [[Millonarios FC]], decided to take advantage of the situation by signing several Argentine stars.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.terra.com.co/millonarios/articulo/html/mil88-el-dorado.htm |title=Terra - Millonarios FC y El Dorado |access-date=2013-07-10 |archive-date=2012-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312141356/http://www.terra.com.co/millonarios/articulo/html/mil88-el-dorado.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The first of the [[Millonarios FC|Millonarios]] signings was [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] star [[Adolfo Pedernera]]. The signing was announced on June 8, 1949, and by the time Pedernera arrived at Bogota's [[Techo International Airport (Colombia)|Techo International Airport]] there were 5,000 fans there to greet him. The club made five times more money on the day of the player's presentation than they earned on a regular league. Other Colombian clubs began scrambling to follow suit by signing stars from all over South America and Europe:<ref>[http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/home/1592/article-168116.html Colombia Aprende - El Dorado] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040245/http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/home/1592/article-168116.html |date=2014-01-06 }}</ref>
