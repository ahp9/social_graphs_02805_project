{{Short description|Invocation in Football}}
The '''''Expresso da Vitória''''' ([[English language|English]]: Victory Express) is known as one of the best [[association football]] squads in the history of [[CR Vasco da Gama]] and played between 1944 and 1953. The name would have appeared in a musical show of [[Rádio Nacional]], where a singer, when performing, said that he would dedicate the music to Vasco, called by him "''Expresso da Vitória''", for running over his opponents on the pitch.

This generation of players, was mainly commanded by the Uruguayan coach [[Ondino Viera]] and was one of the first Brazilian team to use the [[4-2-4 (association football)|4–2–4]] tactical scheme, which strongly influenced Brazilian and Uruguayan football in the 50s.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rotstein |first=Gustavo |date=12 April 2012 |title=GloboEsporte.com - 'Pai' do Expresso da Vitória, técnico uruguaio é referência do Nacional |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/libertadores/noticia/2012/04/pai-do-expresso-da-vitoria-tecnico-uruguaio-e-referencia-do-nacional.html |access-date=12 April 2012}}</ref> The Vasco squad was also the first Brazilian team (either club or national team) to win an international title outside Brazil, the [[South American Championship of Champions]] in 1948. In all, there were eighteen titles in ten years, of which five Campeonato Carioca (three undefeatedly). It formed the basis of the [[Rio de Janeiro state football team|Rio de Janeiro state team]] that won the [[Campeonato Brasileiro de Seleções Estaduais]] in 1946 and 1950,<ref name="expresso2">{{Cite web |last=Alexandre Mesquita e Jefferson Almeida |title=Netvasco: VASCO, REPRESENTANTE DO BRASIL |url=http://www.netvasco.com.br/news/noticias14/45657.shtml |access-date=10 October 2008}}</ref> and of the [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]], champion of the [[Copa Río Branco|Copa Rio Branco]] in 1947 and 1950 and the [[Copa América]] in 1949, in addition to taking Brazil for the first time in history to a final of the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]], with eight Vasco players more the coach, [[Flávio Costa]].

{{See also|History of CR Vasco da Gama}}

=== Beginning ===
In 1942, the club lived an uncomfortable five-year fast without any title within the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Trying to reverse this situation, the Vasco's president Cyro Aranha adopted a long-term policy, based on hiring young players.<ref name="expresso">{{Cite web |last=Alexandre Mesquita e Jefferson Almeida |title=Netvasco: NASCE O EXPRESSO DA VITÓRIA: O PRIMEIRO TIME DO BRASIL CAMPEÃO NO EXTERIOR |url=http://www.netvasco.com.br/news/noticias14/45198.shtml |access-date=10 October 2008}}</ref> That's how goalkeeper [[Moacir Barbosa]], striker [[Ademir de Menezes]], midfielders [[Jair (footballer, born 1921)|Jair]], [[Lelé (footballer)|Lelé]], [[Isaías Benedito da Costa|Isaías]], [[Ely (footballer)|Ely]] and [[Djalma Bezerra dos Santos|Djalma]] and winger [[Chico (footballer, born 1922)|Chico]] arrived. The coach was the Uruguayan [[Ondino Viera]].

The first title came in 1944, with the victory in the Torneio Relâmpago of the Rio de Janeiro state. Later in the same season, the cast would go on to win the [[Torneio Início Carioca|Torneio Início]] and the [[Taça da Prefeitura do Distrito Federal|Torneio Municipal]]. In 1945, the team won the [[1945 Campeonato Carioca|Campeonato Carioca]], in addition to the Torneio Início and Torneio Municipal again.<ref name="expresso" />

In 1946, Vasco lost its main striker: [[Ademir de Menezes]], who went to [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]]. In addition to him, Uruguayan Ondino Viera left and coach Ernesto dos Santos took over. Even with the important shortage, Vasco still won the Torneio Relâmpago and Torneio Municipal that year. In this, [[Moacir Barbosa]] debuted, considered by many the greatest Vasco goalkeeper of all time.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gilmar Ferreira |date=11 January 2007 |title=Gilmar Ferreira: Time dos sonhos... |url=http://oglobo.globo.com/blogs/futebol/post.asp?cod_Post=45911 |access-date=10 September 2008}}</ref>

In 1947, the coach [[Flávio Costa]] took over from Ernesto. The highlight of the season was the attack from Vasco, made up of [[Djalma (footballer, born 1918)|Djalma]], [[Maneca]], [[Friaça]], [[Lelé]] and [[Chico (footballer, born 1922)|Chico]]. In the Torneio Municipal there were 40 goals in 10 games; in the [[1947 Campeonato Carioca|Campeonato Carioca]] the team scored 68 times in 20 games. In this one, the cast applied several routs, highlighting the 14–1 over [[Canto do Rio Foot-Ball Club|Canto do Rio]], the highest score of the professional era of Rio de Janeiro football.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Alexandre Mesquita |title=Netvasco: Há 60 anos o Expresso da Vitória ganhava mais um título carioca |url=http://www.netvasco.com.br/news/noticias14/47422.shtml |access-date=10 September 2008}}</ref> Ademir de Menezer would return to Vasco at the end of 1947.

=== First continental champion in history ===
On December 18, 1947, Vasco received the official invitation to compete in the [[South American Championship of Champions|1948 South American Championship of Champions]], in [[Santiago]], organized by the Chilean champions club [[Colo-Colo]].<ref name="expresso2"/> In addition to Vasco and the organizer, five more clubs took part in the competition: the Argentine [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]], the Uruguayan [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]], the Bolivian [[Club Deportivo Litoral (La Paz)|Litoral]], the Ecuatorian [[C.S. Emelec|Emelec]], and the Peruvian [[Deportivo Municipal]]. This was the great favorite of the tournament: exercising wide dominance over Argentine football in the 40's, the River Plate's ''[[La Máquina]]'' had [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]] as its great star, considered the best player in the world at the time, while the Argentine squad was considered the great South American squad. Another club pointed out as a favorite was Nacional. Vasco, on the other hand, did not enjoy such prestige among the international chronicle.<ref name="expresso3">{{Cite web |last=Alexandre Mesquita e Jefferson Almeida |title=Netvasco: DELEGAÇÃO DO VASCO CHEGA AO CHILE |url=http://www.netvasco.com.br/news/noticias14/46658.shtml |access-date=10 October 2008}}</ref>

Vasco da Gama landed in Santiago on February 8. The Vasco delegation consisted of 26 members under the leadership of Diogo Rangel: the director, Octávio Póvoas; the physician Amílcar Giffoni; the masseuse Mario Américo; cook Laudelino de Oliveira; referee Alberto da Gama Malcher; journalist Ricardo Serran (from the newspaper ''[[O Globo]]''), coach [[Flávio Costa|Flavio Costa]] and eighteen players. The team was formed by the goalkeeper [[Moacir Barbosa]], the defenders [[Augusto da Costa|Augusto]] and [[Wilson Francisco Alves|Wilson]], the midfielders [[Danilo Faria Alvim|Danilo Alvim]], [[Ely (footballer)|Ely]] and [[Jorge Dias Sacramento|Jorge Dias]], and the strikers [[Ademir de Menezes|Ademir Menezes]], [[Chico (footballer, born 1922)|Chico]], [[Djalma Bezerra dos Santos|Djalma]], [[Friaça]], [[Ismael Caetano|Ismael]], [[Manuel Marinho Alves|Maneca]] and [[Lelé]].<ref name="expresso3" />

Vasco came away with the trophy after a deciding 0–0 draw against [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] on the last round of matches. Vasco da Gama had already defeated [[Club Deportivo Litoral (La Paz)|Lítoral]] and [[Club Sport Emelec|Emelec]] 1–0 each, thumped [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]] 3–1, trashed [[Club Centro Deportivo Municipal|Deportivo Municipal]] 4–0 and tied 1–1 with the host club [[Colo-Colo]].

=== Last years ===
The team would win three more editions of the [[Campeonato Carioca]] in [[1949 Campeonato Carioca|1949]], [[1950 Campeonato Carioca|1950]] and [[1952 Campeonato Carioca|1952]]. The coach [[Flávio Costa]] was chosen to lead the [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]] in the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]], which also had six players from Vasco in its starting roster, while he was still at Vasco. In 1953, the club started looking for younger players. The old players were then replaced by new players, such as [[Vavá]], Ademir's replacement, who was making his debut that year. Vavá would command a next Vasco team after ''Expresso da Vitória'', which would go on to win important titles such as the [[1957 Tournoi de Paris]].
