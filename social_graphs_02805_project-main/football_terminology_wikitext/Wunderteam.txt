{{Short description|Austrian national football team of the 1930s}}
'''''Wunderteam''''' ({{IPA|de|ˈvʊndɐˌtiːm}}; ''Wonder Team'') was the name given to the [[Austria national football team]] of the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNuoU8qgR_YC&q=Wunderteam&pg=PA36 |title=The Story Has Been Told - Milile Kraba - Google Books |date= 10 September 2010|isbn=9781453566107 |accessdate=2016-07-05|last1=Kraba |first1=Milile }}</ref> Led by manager [[Hugo Meisl]], the team had an unbeaten streak of 14 games between April 1931 and December 1932. The style of the team focused on quick passing introduced by Englishman [[Jimmy Hogan]]. The forward line was complemented by wide half-backs and an attacking centre-half. [[Matthias Sindelar]], [[Josef Bican]], [[Anton Schall]], [[Josef Smistik]] and [[Walter Nausch]] were the referents of the team that would dominate European football during that era.  [[Matthias Sindelar]], known as ''[[wikt:de:papieren|Der Papierene]]'' (''The Paper-thin Man'') due to his slight build, was the star and captain of the team.<ref>[http://www.wienerzeitung.at/Desktopdefault.aspx?tabID=3946&alias=Wzo&lexikon=Sport&letter=S&cob=4649, Der Papierene]</ref>

==Profile and history==

===Rise to fame and success===
In the early 1930s, Austria became a very celebrated team in Europe. Before  the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]], they routed many of their opponents, including a 5-0 and a 6-0 victory over [[Germany national football team|Germany]], a 6-0 victory over [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], and an 8-2 victory over [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. They also won the [[Central European International Cup]], predecessor of the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]], by beating [[Italy national football team|Italy]] 4-2 in 1932. The cup was to be Wunderteam's only championship win.

===1934 World Cup===
Austria entered the [[1934 World Cup]] as one of the favorites. In the quarter-final they eliminated [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], which was to be the runner-up in the 1938 edition. Like the [[Magical Magyars|Golden Team]] of Hungary 20 years later, Austria failed to lift the World Cup trophy, despite playing beautiful football.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mn0xBwAAQBAJ&q=Wunderteam&pg=PA21 |title=A History of the World Cup: 1930-2014 - Clemente A. Lisi - Google Books |date=1937-01-24 |accessdate=2016-07-05|last1=Lisi |first1=Clemente A. }}</ref> They were eliminated by the eventual champion Italy in the semi-final, a match under poor weather conditions that limited their movement of the ball. The only score came when the Austrian goalkeeper was pushed over the line. Referee [[Ivan Eklind]] was criticized for partiality toward the host nation, especially after he also refereed the final, which Italy also won. Austria finished fourth after losing 2-3 to Germany in the third place match.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/news/y=2007/m=4/news=hugo-meisl-the-banker-son-who-masterminded-wunderteam-512141.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009052211/http://www.fifa.com/news/y=2007/m=4/news=hugo-meisl-the-banker-son-who-masterminded-wunderteam-512141.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 9, 2015 |title=Hugo Meisl - The banker's son who masterminded a Wunderteam |publisher=FIFA.com |date=2016-06-30 |accessdate=2016-07-05}}</ref>

===World War II and the end of the team===
The death of [[Hugo Meisl]] in 1937 marked the beginning of the end. Austria qualified for the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]] finals, but they withdrew less than three months before the start of the tournament, after the March 1938 [[Anschluss]] to [[Nazi Germany]]. The Austrian Soccer Federation dissolved and voluntarily integrated itself into the "Deutschen Reichsbund für Leibesübungen" that coordinated all sports in [[Nazi Germany|Nazi-Germany]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Österreichische Fußballnationalmannschaft |date=2024-10-14 |work=Wikipedia |url=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96sterreichische_Fu%C3%9Fballnationalmannschaft#/media/Datei:Aufl%C3%B6sung_%C3%96FB.jpg |access-date=2024-10-18 |language=de}}</ref> For political reasons, German officials demanded that players from "Hitler's home state" play in the [[Germany national football team|Germany national team]], ordering coach [[John Herberger|Herberger]] to change the lineup on short notice. Several Austrian players were capped for the combined team failed to live up to expectations, as they were eliminated in the first round. That World Cup campaign was Germany's worst ever World Cup finals performance until 2018. [[Matthias Sindelar]], who did not play for Germany, was found dead in his home in 1939, under circumstances that have been debated since.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/22/world-cup-stunning-moments-austria-wunderteam World Cup: 25 stunning moments … No11: Austria's Wunderteam go close].

===Influence on Total Football===
The ill-fated Austrian Wunderteam is also credited in some circles as being the first national team to play [[Total Football]]. It is no coincidence that [[Ernst Happel]], a talented Austrian player in the 1940s and 1950s, was coach in the Netherlands in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He introduced a tougher style of play at the clubs [[ADO Den Haag|ADO]] and [[Feyenoord]], and managed the Netherlands national team in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]], where they finished as runners-up for the second time in a row.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kennedy |first=Paul |url=http://www.socceramerica.com/article/54958/long-gone-are-the-days-of-the-wunderteam.html |title=Long gone are the days of the 'Wunderteam' 11/19/2013 |publisher=SoccerAmerica |date=2013-11-19 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/nov/22/sport.comment2 |title=How total football inventor was lost to Hungary &#124; Football |publisher=The Guardian |date=2003-11-22 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Phil Gordos |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/euro2008/2008/06/when_austria_were_good_at_foot.html |title=BBC SPORT &#124; Euro 2008 blog |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bevan |first=Chris |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25055156 |title=BBC Sport - Jimmy Hogan: The Englishman who inspired the Magical Magyars |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-11-24 |access-date=2013-12-03}}</ref>
