Benfica|Benfica]].

During his first tenure as coach of [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in Portugal, he won the [[2018–19 Primeira Liga|2018–19 league title]] and the [[2019 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira|2019 Super Cup]].

He deployed a new 4–4–1–1 formation in order to play to the strengths of Felix as a shadow striker behind [[Haris Seferovic]], giving him freedom to roam while encouraging his full-backs to attack and using technically gifted midfielders in order to both defend and create.

Felix started 28 of 29 matches in all competitions under Lage, scoring 17 goals and recording 10 assists.
