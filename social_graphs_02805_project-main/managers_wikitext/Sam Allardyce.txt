'''Samuel Allardyce''' (born 19 October 1954) is an English [[association football|football]] manager and former professional player. Allardyce made 578 league and cup appearances in a 21-year career spent mostly in [[the Football League]], as well as brief spells in the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] and [[League of Ireland]]. He was signed by [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] from [[Dudley Town F.C.|Dudley Town]] in 1969 and spent nine years at Bolton, helping the club to win the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in 1977–78. He spent the 1980s as a [[Journeyman (sports)|journeyman]] player, spending time with [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975–93)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], Bolton Wanderers (for a second spell), [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] (also working as assistant manager). During this time, he helped Preston win promotion out of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1986–87.

Moving into management, he took charge of Irish club [[Limerick F.C.|Limerick]] in 1991, leading the club to the [[League of Ireland First Division]] (second tier) title in 1991–92. He returned to England as a youth coach at Preston North End and served briefly as caretaker-manager. He took up his first permanent management role in England at [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in July 1994 but was dismissed after two years, having narrowly failed to achieve promotion. He spent January 1997 to October 1999 in charge at [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], taking them to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] title in 1997–98. He then returned to Bolton Wanderers as manager, leading the club to promotion out of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] via [[2001 Football League First Division play-off final|the play-offs in 2001]], as well as a [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] [[2004 Football League Cup final|final]] and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] qualification on two occasions.

Following a spell at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] from May 2007 to January 2008, Allardyce managed [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for two years from December 2008. He was appointed [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] manager in June 2011, leading the club to promotion out of the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] via the play-offs in 2012 before leaving West Ham in May 2015 after criticism from fans over his playing style. He was appointed [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] manager in October 2015, saving the club from relegation. He was appointed as manager of the [[England national football team|England national team]] for a brief spell in July 2016 before taking charge at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] five months later. After helping Palace avoid relegation that season, he resigned in May 2017. He has since had spells as manager at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] from 2017 to 2018, West Bromwich Albion from 2020 to 2021, and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in May 2023.

Some analysts have labelled Allardyce a [[long ball]] manager, though he has disputed this perception as "totally and utterly wrong". He takes a modern technology—and statistics-centred approach to tactics and coaching and has been praised for his organizational and man-management skills. Allardyce has faced allegations of misconduct in two separate undercover media investigations, though he denied wrongdoing and was ultimately not charged in either case. In September 2006, he and his son, [[Craig Allardyce|Craig]], were implicated in a [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' documentary for taking bribes, allegations which they denied. In September 2016, undercover ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' reporters posing as businessmen recorded him offering to help them to get around FA [[Third-party ownership in association football|third party ownership]] rules and provisionally agreeing a £400,000 contract.<ref name="Telegraph 270916">{{cite news|title=Sam Allardyce on the brink of being sacked as England manager after Telegraph investigation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/27/sam-allardyces-position-as-england-manager-under-threat-after-te/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/27/sam-allardyces-position-as-england-manager-under-threat-after-te/ |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|access-date=27 September 2016|work=Daily Telegraph|date=27 September 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Following [[2016 English football scandal|the ''Daily Telegraph'' investigation]], Allardyce resigned as England manager in a mutual agreement with [[the Football Association]] on 27 September.<ref name="SSN resignation">{{cite news|title=Sam Allardyce updates LIVE!|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/live-blog/12016/10595090/sam-allardyce-latest|access-date=27 September 2016|agency=Sky Sports News|publisher=Sky|date=27 September 2016}}</ref>

==Early life==
Samuel Allardyce was born in October 1954 on the Old Park Farm Estate, [[Dudley]], the son of Robert Allardyce (27 April 1916 – 23 August 1989) and Mary Agnes Maxwell Allardyce née Duff (7 June 1918 – 3 July 1991).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dingwall |first1=John |title=Sam Allardyce Scots parents' heartbreaking decision to be buried 250 miles apart |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/former-england-boss-sam-allardyce-18206645 |access-date=31 October 2021 |work=Daily Record |date=14 July 2019 |language=en}}</ref> His father was a [[Sergeant#United Kingdom|police sergeant]].<ref name="telegraph1014">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/west-ham/11186527/Sam-Allardyce-West-Hams-owners-are-best-Ive-ever-had-and-deserve-this-success-after-not-sacking-me.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/west-ham/11186527/Sam-Allardyce-West-Hams-owners-are-best-Ive-ever-had-and-deserve-this-success-after-not-sacking-me.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Sam Allardyce: West Ham's owners are best I've ever had and deserve this success after not sacking me |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=24 October 2014 | access-date=26 October 2014 |last=Winter |first=Henry}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Both parents originated from Scotland: his father from [[Nairn]] and his mother from [[Dumfries]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=16}}</ref> He has an older sister, Mary, born in Scotland in 1939, and an older brother, Robert Junior, born in 1951. Allardyce was educated at Sycamore Green Primary School and later at [[Defunct schools in the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley#Mons Hill School|Mons Hill School]], having been unsuccessful in his [[Eleven-plus]] exam.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=18}}</ref> He discovered in later life that he has [[dyslexia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=11}}</ref> As a child, he supported [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and dreamed that one day he would play at and manage the club.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/sports_talk/forum/1360531.stm | title=Q and A Bolton boss Sam Allardyce | work=BBC News |date=30 May 2001 |access-date=10 April 2014}}</ref>

==Club career==

===Bolton Wanderers===
Allardyce spent his youth with semi-professional side [[Dudley Town F.C.|Dudley Town]], making his debut at 14. He quickly learned how to play centre-half in the highly physical [[West Midlands (Regional) League]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=19}}</ref> He trained with local [[The Football League|Football League]] clubs [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and Wolverhampton Wanderers. He had an unsuccessful trial with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=20}}</ref> He was spotted by [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] just before leaving school at the age of 15 and signed an apprenticeship with the club.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=22}}</ref> To supplement his income before officially starting his apprenticeship he worked in a factory producing [[Phonograph|record decks]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=24}}</ref> The Bolton under-18s were very successful, winning the Lancashire Youth Cup and reaching the quarter-finals of the [[FA Youth Cup]], and Allardyce quickly rose through the B-team into the A-team.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=31}}</ref> He signed his first professional contract on his 17th birthday, receiving a £125 signing on fee and wages of £14 a week.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=32}}</ref>

Manager [[Jimmy Armfield]] gave Allardyce his debut for the "Trotters" on 6 November 1973, in a 2–1 [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] defeat to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] at [[Burnden Park]].<ref name="page 34">{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=34}}</ref> He made his [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] debut eleven days later, in a 2–1 defeat to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].<ref name="page 34"/> However he failed to establish himself in the first team under Armfield, and only got a run of games under new manager [[Ian Greaves]], who played Allardyce in the last ten games of the [[1974–75 Football League|1974–75]] season after he sold [[Don McAllister]] to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=35}}</ref> He impressed during this short run, winning himself the club's Young Player of the Year award.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=36}}</ref>

Bolton lost to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] after two replays in the [[FA Cup]] Fifth Round in the [[1975–76 Football League|1975–76]] season, and went on to miss out on promotion out of the league by a single point.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=40}}</ref> They were similarly disappointed in the [[1976–77 Football League|1976–77]] campaign, reaching the semi-finals of the League Cup, and again finished just one point outside the promotion places.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=41}}</ref> Allardyce played alongside [[Paul Jones (footballer, born May 1953)|Paul Jones]] at centre-half, and a scouting report for England manager [[Don Revie]] in 1977 described Allardyce and Jones as "one of the best central defensive pairings in the Football League." Despite this, however, he was never called up to the England team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/soccer-news/sam-allardyces-tendency-dive-tackles-8757052|title=Sam Allardyce ALMOST received England call-up as a player - here's why he didn't|first=James|last=Whaling|date=2 September 2016|website=Irish Mirror}}</ref> Promotion was finally achieved in the [[1977–78 Football League|1977–78]] season, as Bolton returned to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] as champions of the Second Division.<ref name="page 43">{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=43}}</ref> Bolton consolidated their top-flight status with a 17th-place finish in [[1978–79 Football League|1978–79]].<ref name="page 44"/> However the [[1979–80 Football League|1979–80]] season proved difficult, and manager Greaves was dismissed as the club went seven months without a league victory, whilst his replacement [[Stan Anderson]] was unable to steer the club away from relegation and a last-place finish.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=48}}</ref> Allardyce decided to leave Bolton at the end of the season as he felt that he was underpaid at Bolton and did not get on with Anderson.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=49}}</ref>

===Sunderland and Millwall===
Allardyce was offered a contract by [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] manager [[John Bond (footballer)|John Bond]]. The offer was bettered by [[Colin Addison]] at [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], and he verbally agreed a three-year contract with Derby.<ref name="page 52">{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=52}}</ref> However, before signing the contract, he received a late offer from [[Ken Knighton]] to play for [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on a £300 a week contract with a £20,000 signing on fee – which more than quadrupled his wage at Bolton.<ref name="page 52"/> Allardyce signed for Sunderland on 1 July 1980 for £150,000.<ref>The Times - 2 July 1980</ref> Knighton appointed him as club captain.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=53}}</ref> However, Allardyce soon wearied of the long-distance travel from [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] to his home in [[Bolton]], and put in a transfer request when chairman [[Tom Cowie]] refused to help finance the purchase of a home in Sunderland.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=54}}</ref> Cowie dismissed Knighton late in the [[1980–81 Football League|1980–81]] season, leaving caretaker manager [[Mick Docherty]] in charge to steer the club out of the First Division relegation zone.<ref name="page 55">{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=55}}</ref> New manager [[Alan Durban]] left Allardyce out of the team at the start of the [[1981–82 Football League|1981–82]] campaign, leaving Allardyce's departure from [[Roker Park]] inevitable.<ref name="page 55"/>

He was offered the chance to return to Bolton Wanderers, but manager [[George Mulhall]] was only able to offer 50% of Allardyce's wages at Sunderland.<ref name="page 55"/> Instead he made a surprise £95,000 move to [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] side [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], who were able to match Sunderland's wages and also pay out a £30,000 signing on fee and a £10,000 loyalty bonus.<ref name="page 55"/> Millwall player-manager [[Peter Anderson (footballer, born 1949)|Peter Anderson]] had seen Allardyce as the successor to long-serving central defender [[Barry Kitchener]], and as Anderson was also a property developer he allowed Allardyce to live rent free in a six-bedroom mansion.<ref name="page 55"/> The "Lions" ended the 1981–82 season in mid-table, and Anderson was dismissed in November 1982.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=57}}</ref> Chairman Alan Thorne offered Allardyce the vacant management position, but Allardyce rejected the offer as he felt that at aged 28 he was far too young to enter management.<ref name="page 58">{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=58}}</ref> Instead it was [[George Graham (footballer, born 1944)|George Graham]] who took up his first management position, and Graham immediately froze Allardyce out of the first team on both matchdays and training after Allardyce insisted that he would not report teammates who broke Graham's rules.<ref name="page 58"/> He came close to joining [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on a free transfer in March 1983, but Charlton boss [[Lennie Lawrence]] did not complete the move before the end of the transfer deadline.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=59}}</ref> Graham agreed to pay Allardyce £15,000 to cancel his contract, acting under the assumption that Allardyce would struggle to find a club willing to offer him £300 a week.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=62}}</ref>

===Later career===
Allardyce wrote to every club in the top two divisions to inform them he was available on a free transfer and privately lamented choosing his past clubs for financial rather than footballing reasons.<ref name="page 60">{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=60}}</ref> Over the summer he played 11 games in the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] for the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975–93)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]], a club that shared facilities with the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].<ref name="nasl_profile">{{cite web | url = http://www.nasljerseys.com/Players/A/Allardyce.Sam.htm | title = Sam Allardyce | work = NASL Player Profile | access-date =17 December 2008 }}</ref> Allardyce subsequently applied in his managerial career many modern practices of [[American football]] with regards to training, player management and tactics.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.com/article/sam-allardyce-awaits-his-next-big-calling-0xdvlj3zk9q |title=Sam Allardyce awaits his next big calling |work=[[The Times]] |date=22 November 2008 |access-date=17 December 2008 |location=London |last=Rudd |first=Alyson}}</ref> He found playing difficult however, due to the heat and the all-out attacking nature of his teammates, which led to him being frequently exposed at the back, though he found that the club's masseurs managed to cure a long-standing [[hamstring]] scar tissue problem.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=64}}</ref>

Upon returning to the UK, he joined [[Bobby Gould]]'s First Division [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] on a one-year £300 a week contract.<ref name="page 60"/> He was made captain, and though Coventry enjoyed a good first half to the [[1983–84 Football League|1983–84]] season, they faltered badly in the second half of the season. They finished just one place and two points above the relegation zone after beating Norwich City on the season's final day.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=69}}</ref> Midway through the campaign, Gould had promised him a new two-year contract, but following the poor end to the season, he instead opted to release Allardyce.<ref name="page 70">{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=70}}</ref>

In July 1984, he was signed by [[Mick Buxton]] at Second Division [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].<ref name="page 70"/> The move reunited him with [[Paul Jones (footballer, born May 1953)|Paul Jones]], his former centre-half partner at Bolton.<ref name="page 71">{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=71}}</ref> Huddersfield finished in 13th place in the [[1984–85 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season|1984–85]] season, and at the end of the campaign accepted an offer of £15,000 from Bolton Wanderers, who offered Allardyce a three-year contract.<ref name="page 71"/> Bolton were then managed by [[Charlie Wright]], who was the goalkeeper during Allardyce's first spell with the club.<ref name="page 71"/> However, Wright was dismissed in December 1985, and his successor, [[Phil Neal]], did not get along with Allardyce.<ref name="page 71"/> Neal played himself at centre-half and relegated Allardyce to the bench, despite Neal being a full-back.<ref name="page 71"/> Bolton reached the [[1986 Associate Members' Cup Final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], which ended in a 3–0 defeat to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], with Allardyce as an unused substitute.<ref name="page 72">{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=72}}</ref>

Allardyce was offered the chance to join [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]], but instead joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] after being persuaded by manager [[John McGrath (footballer, born 1938)|John McGrath]], who promised to make Allardyce the backbone of his team.<ref name="page 72"/> Preston won promotion out of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in second-place in [[1986–87 Football League|1986–87]] (Allardyce was also named on the [[PFA Team of the Year]]), and consolidated their Third Division status with a 16th-place finish in [[1987–88 Football League|1987–88]].<ref name="Lynch 140">{{Cite book| first = Tony| last = Lynch| title = The Official P.F.A.

==Style of play==
Bolton fans gave him the nickname "Super Sam [[Steve Austin (character)|Bionic Man]]" due to his tough tackling approach and the way he quickly got up after heavy collisions whilst the opposition player would be left flat on the ground.<ref name="page 37">{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=37}}</ref> Veteran manager [[Dave Bassett]], a friend of Allardyce, once humorously remarked that "He was what I called a ball-playing defender... If he wasn't playing with the ball he was playing with your balls."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/feb/13/newsstory.sport3 |title=Bolton buzzing again as Allardyce builds for future |last1=Taylor |first1=Daniel |date=13 February 2001 |website=[[theguardian.com]] |access-date=4 May 2016}}</ref> He was uncomfortable in possession. He played simple balls to his nearest teammates when he found himself with the ball, whilst teammates would be reluctant to pass to him.<ref name="page 37"/> He did however possess good awareness and heading skills, and his anticipation made up for his lack of pace.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=38}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
===Early career===
Allardyce was hired as a player-coach by [[Brian Talbot]] at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in February 1989.<ref name="Times020105">Walsh, David; [https://www.thetimes.com/article/the-big-interview-sam-allardyce-c6b0v29z95z "The Big Interview: Sam Allardyce"] [[The Times|''TimesOnline.co.uk'']], 2 January 2005 (Retrieved 25 July 2009)</ref> He spent most of the rest of the [[1988–89 Football League|1988–89]] season at [[The Hawthorns]] managing and playing for the reserve team, before being promoted to first team coach in the summer, in a move that saw former first-team coach [[Stuart Pearson]] demoted to reserve team coaching.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=79}}</ref> Allardyce and Talbot were dismissed in January 1991 following a defeat to [[Isthmian League]] side [[Woking F.C.|Woking]] in the [[FA Cup]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=81}}</ref> He later worked as a part-time coach at [[Bury F.C.|Bury]], but manager [[Mike Walsh (footballer)|Mike Walsh]] could not afford to keep him on the staff for the [[1989–90 Football League|1989–90]] season.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=85}}</ref>

Allardyce then took up the role of player-manager of [[Limerick F.C.|Limerick]] and guided the team to promotion into the [[League of Ireland Premier Division]] after winning the [[1991–92 League of Ireland First Division]]. Despite tremendous financial pressures, they achieved promotion, with Allardyce coaching and playing for the first team whilst the club board signed players as Allardyce had no knowledge of the Irish football scene.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=90}}</ref>

After his season in Ireland, Allardyce returned to England for the start of the [[1992–93 Football League|1992–93]] season to coach at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] under [[Les Chapman]].<ref name="page 92">{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=92}}</ref> Ten games into the season, however, Chapman was dismissed and Allardyce was appointed [[caretaker manager]].<ref name="page 92"/> Despite a promising spell in charge, Allardyce did not get the job permanently, and in December 1992 Preston appointed [[John Beck (footballer)|John Beck]] as manager.<ref name="page 93">{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=93}}</ref> Allardyce worked as youth team coach for 18 months, but later said the extreme [[long ball]] tactics Beck enforced upon the club were "indefensible".<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=95}}</ref>

===Bolton Wanderers===

====Promotion out of Division One====
Allardyce was appointed manager of Bolton Wanderers following [[Colin Todd]]'s departure, who had resigned in protest at the sale of [[Per Frandsen]] as the club attempted to raise funds for the new [[Macron Stadium|Reebok Stadium]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=123}}</ref> He inherited a talented squad, which included [[Eiður Guðjohnsen]], [[Jussi Jääskeläinen]], [[Mark Fish]], [[Claus Jensen]], [[Dean Holdsworth]], [[Bo Hansen]], [[Michael Johansen]], and [[Ricardo Gardner]].<ref name="page 127">{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=127}}</ref> He was forced to sell [[Andy Todd (footballer, born 1974)|Andy Todd]], son of Colin Todd, after he broke assistant manager Phil Brown's jaw in a team-bonding session.<ref name="page 127"/> Despite being in the bottom half of the table when he took over, Bolton reached the [[1999–2000 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season|1999–2000]] Division One play-offs, losing to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in the semi-finals, and had an eventful run to the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and [[FA Cup]] semi-finals, only missing out on the [[2000 FA Cup Final]] after a penalty shoot-out defeat to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=129}}</ref> He blamed referee [[Barry Knight (referee)|Barry Knight]] for the play-off defeat, accused him of being biased against Bolton.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=132}}</ref> Allardyce was rewarded for turning the club around with a ten-year contract, though the terms of the contract only entitled him to a one-year's compensation pay if he was dismissed.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=130}}</ref>

In summer 2000, Guðjohnsen and Jensen were sold for £4&nbsp;million each.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=133}}</ref> Allardyce focused on spending money to improve the club's facilities and backroom staff, believing that money spent in these areas would allow Bolton to compete with clubs who had bigger budgets and paid bigger wages than Bolton could afford.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=134}}</ref> On the playing front he spent £400,000 on striker [[Michael Ricketts]] and £1.5&nbsp;million to bring back Frandsen from Blackburn and also signed utility player [[Ian Marshall (English footballer)|Ian Marshall]] and [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] loanee [[Isaiah Rankin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=136}}</ref> Teenager [[Kevin Nolan]] was also promoted from the youth team, whilst 35-year-old defender [[Colin Hendry]] arrived on loan.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=137}}</ref> Bolton reached the [[2001 Football League First Division play-off final|play-off final]] at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[2000–01 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season|2000–01]], where they beat [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] 3–0 to achieve promotion to the [[Premier League]] after a three-year absence.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=142}}</ref>

====Premier League survival====
Building for the [[2001–02 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season|2001–02]] Premier League campaign, Allardyce signed [[France national football team|France]] international defender [[Bruno Ngotty]] from [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in a loan deal which was eventually made into a permanent one after Ngotty established himself as a key first team player.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=145}}</ref> He also brought in [[Henrik Pedersen (footballer)|Henrik Pedersen]] from [[Silkeborg IF]] for £650,000, though otherwise remained loyal to the players that had won promotion the previous campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bolton_wanderers/1420715.stm |title=Bolton snap up Pedersen |date=3 July 2001 |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=26 September 2011 }}</ref> They recorded a 5–0 win at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on the opening day, then beat [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] to secure nine points from their first three games.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=149}}</ref> After six games without a win, Bolton then recorded a shock 2–1 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 20 October.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=151}}</ref> However their form dropped, and so in the January transfer window Allardyce brought in Danish midfielder [[Stig Tøfting]], German striker [[Fredi Bobic]] (on loan), and [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]-winning attacker [[Youri Djorkaeff]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=152}}</ref> Djorkaeff scored both goals in a 2–1 win over [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on 23 March and Bobic scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 win over Ipswich Town on 6 April; the victory over Ipswich proved to be essential as Bolton ended the season in 16th place on 40 points, ahead of Ipswich who were relegated with 36 points.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=153}}</ref>

Allardyce managed to sign another big name on a free transfer for the [[2002–03 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season|2002–03]] season, bringing in 28-year-old [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] captain [[Jay-Jay Okocha]], who four years previously had been purchased by [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] for £14&nbsp;million.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=156}}</ref> He also brought in Spanish central defender [[Iván Campo]] on loan from [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=157}}</ref> He sold 2001–02 top-scorer [[Michael Ricketts]] to Middlesbrough for £3.5&nbsp;million, bringing in [[Pierre-Yves André]] on loan as his replacement.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=161}}</ref> Bolton struggled all season but managed to avoid relegation with a final-day win over Middlesbrough.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bolton seal survival|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2978087.stm|access-date=2 April 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 May 2003}}</ref>

Looking to avoid another relegation battle, Allardyce made some signings in preparation for the [[2003–04 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season|2003–04]] season, the most significant of which were Brazilian defender [[Emerson Thome]], [[Greece national football team|Greece]] international [[Stelios Giannakopoulos]], and target-man striker [[Kevin Davies]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=164}}</ref> Allardyce's side finished eighth in the league and reached the League Cup final, in what was his first major domestic final appearance as a player or manager.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=167}}</ref> Bolton lost [[2004 Football League Cup Final|2–1]] to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the final, though Allardyce blamed referee [[Mike Riley (referee)|Mike Riley]] for not giving a late penalty for an alleged handball by [[Ugo Ehiogu]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=168}}</ref>

====Venture in Europe====
Now an established Premier League club, Bolton signed veteran internationals [[Gary Speed]] and [[Fernando Hierro]], aged 35 and 36 respectively.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=169}}</ref> Speed and Hierro went into midfield, while [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] international [[Radhi Jaïdi]] was played at centre-back after arriving on a free transfer from [[Espérance Sportive de Tunis|Espérance]]; he was played alongside another new arrival, [[Israel national football team|Israel]] defender [[Tal Ben Haim]], who was recommended by Allardyce's son Craig.<ref name="page 170">{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=170}}</ref> He also brought in [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] striker [[El Hadji Diouf]] on a season-long loan from Liverpool, whom he would eventually sign permanently for £3&nbsp;million.<ref name="page 170"/> After a good start to the season, Allardyce was offered the Newcastle United job, but turned it down and instead signed a new five-year contract with Bolton as he felt the Bolton squad to be more talented.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=171}}</ref> Bolton went on to finish in sixth place in [[2004–05 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season|2004–05]] to win qualification to the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] for the first time in the [[History of Bolton Wanderers F.C.|club's history]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=174}}</ref>

Bolton reached the Round of 32 in the UEFA Cup in [[2005–06 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season|2005–06]], beating [[PFC Lokomotiv Plovdiv|Lokomotiv Plovdiv]] ([[Bulgaria]]) in the First Round and successfully negotiating through the Group stage after beating [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit Saint Petersburg]] (Russia), and drawing with [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] (Spain), [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] ([[Turkey]]) and [[Vitória S.C.|Vitória Guimarães]] (Portugal), before losing to Marseille (France) in the knock-out stages.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=186}}</ref> Allardyce's success with Bolton resulted in [[the Football Association|the FA]] putting him on a short-list of four people to succeed [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] as [[England national football team|England]] [[England national football team manager|manager]] after the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], alongside [[Alan Curbishley]], [[Steve McClaren]] and [[Martin O'Neill]].<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=189}}</ref> He was interviewed for the position and was told by FA Chief Executive [[Brian Barwick]] that the final choice would be between him and McClaren however the FA eventually decided to give the job to McClaren.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=196}}</ref> Allardyce was also again offered the Newcastle job and was this time to keen to take it, but Newcastle chairman Freddie Shepard broke off contract negotiations after electing to appoint caretaker-manager [[Glenn Roeder]] on a full-time basis.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=199}}</ref> Allardyce's team seemed unaffected by speculation on his future or by their European exploits and ended the season in eighth position.

Keen to strengthen Bolton for a European push in the [[2006–07 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season|2006–07]] season, Allardyce signed France international striker [[Nicolas Anelka]] from [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football)|Fenerbahçe]] for a [[List of Bolton Wanderers F.C. records and statistics|club record]] £8&nbsp;million.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=200}}</ref> He also signed [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] defender [[Abdoulaye Méïté]] from Marseille, and in an unusual sequence of events made a £400,000 profit on [[Dietmar Hamann]], who changed his mind about joining Bolton and signed with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] a day after signing a pre-contract agreement with Bolton; Manchester City agreed to pay Bolton £400,000 in compensation.<ref>{{harvnb|Allardyce|2015|p=201}}</ref> Bolton had another good season: their 16 points from their first eight games was the last time for 14 years that two teams from outside the so-called 'big six' averaged at least two points per match in their first eight games (the other team being Portsmouth).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uk.yahoo.com/news/leicester-southampton-villa-hint-shake-081726891.html |title=Leicester, Southampton and Villa hint at shake-up at the top |agency=Reuters |first=Martyn |last=Herman |work=Yahoo!
