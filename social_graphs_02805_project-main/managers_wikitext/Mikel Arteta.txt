'''Mikel Arteta Amatriain''' (born 26 March 1982) is a Spanish professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Association football|player]] who is the manager of {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].

Arteta began his senior club career at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 1999, but limited playing time led to a loan move to [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] in 2001, where he won the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in his second season. Arteta joined [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in 2002 for £6 million and won the [[2002–03 Scottish Premier League|league]] and [[2002–03 Scottish League Cup|league cup]] in his debut season, scoring a 93rd-minute penalty on the final day. After a brief return to his hometown club [[Real Sociedad]], Arteta signed for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2005 and was named the club's [[List of Everton F.C. records and statistics#Evertonfc.com player awards|Player of the Season]] twice. He joined Arsenal in 2011 for £10 million and won two [[FA Cup]]s before retiring in 2016. Arteta represented [[Spain]] through several youth levels but never played for the senior national team.

Arteta was appointed as an assistant coach to [[Pep Guardiola]] at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 2016. He returned at Arsenal in a managerial capacity in 2019 and won the [[2019-20 FA Cup|FA Cup]] in his debut season. Arteta has since gone onto become Arsenal's [[List of Arsenal F.C. managers#Managers|seventh-longest serving manager]].

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Born in [[San Sebastián]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], Arteta began his football career at [[Antiguoko]] and befriended fellow midfielder [[Xabi Alonso]] as they played together every weekend.<ref name="Arteta&Alonso">{{cite news |date=19 November 2005 |title=Mikel Arteta: 'It's a long way from San Sebastian...' |work=The Independent |location=London |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/mikel-arteta-its-a-long-way-from-san-sebastian-515944.html |url-status=live |url-access=subscription |access-date=13 August 2010 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220514/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/mikel-arteta-its-a-long-way-from-san-sebastian-515944.html |archive-date=14 May 2022}}</ref> The two often played along the beaches and gutters of San Sebastián and dreamed of playing together at [[Real Sociedad]].<ref name="Arteta&Alonso" /> Arteta left San Sebastián aged 15 in July 1997, with Antiguoko teammates Jon Alvarez and Mikel Yanguas, to trial with [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s youth academy, [[La Masia]].<ref name=":Athletic1">{{Cite news |last=Campbell |first=Jordan |date=23 March 2023 |title=Mikel Arteta, the early years: 'Everyone knew he had a chance at Barca but Xavi was extraordinary' |work=The Athletic |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4302245/2023/03/23/mikel-arteta-barcelona-xavi-iniesta/ |url-access=subscription |access-date=24 March 2023}}</ref> The trio played three trial games and all earned professional contracts with the club.<ref name=":Athletic1" /> Housed in dormitories, the academy lifestyle was notoriously strict and Arteta's Antiguoko teammates would leave the academy shortly after arrival.<ref name=":Athletic1" /> It was in these dormitories where Arteta would become room-mates and friends with Barca legends [[Víctor Valdés]] and [[Andrés Iniesta]] as teenagers.<ref name=":BBCSport1">{{cite web |last1=Balague |first1=Guillem |title=At home with Arteta – childhood, career and family |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2qvqn03z4vo |website=BBC Sport |date=16 May 2024 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> He would also make friends with budding club legend [[Xavi (footballer, born 1980)|Xavi Hernandez]] during his tenure at La Masia.<ref name=":BBCSport1" /> Arteta met then-Barcelona captain and his future coaching mentor [[Pep Guardiola]] during this time, while learning the practices of their then-head coach [[Louis van Gaal]].<ref name=":Athletic1" />

Arteta trained regularly with Van Gaal's first team but was limited only to appearances in Spain's [[Segunda División B]] with [[FC Barcelona Atlètic|Barcelona B]].<ref name=":Athletic1" /> Following Van Gaal's departure from the club on 20 May 2000, incoming coach [[Lorenzo Serra Ferrer]] brought [[Emmanuel Petit]] and [[Gerard López|Gerard Lopez]] into Barcelona's midfield, pushing Arteta further back into a queue which already included Guardiola, [[Luis Enrique]], [[Phillip Cocu]], [[Iván de la Peña]], Xavi and Iniesta.<ref name=":Athletic1" /> La Masia teammate [[Jofre Mateu]] believed that Arteta wouldn't make it at Barcelona purely because of his competition, explaining in 2023, "Everyone knew he had a chance because of his quality but Xavi was extraordinary and Iniesta could play every position. I wasn't expecting him to be a Barcelona star because of the others."<ref name=":Athletic1" /> With administrative changes in La Masia during the [[2000–01 FC Barcelona season|2000−01 season]], Arteta and a number of his club mates quickly learnt that their futures were no longer with Barcelona.<ref name=":Athletic1" />

==== Loan to Paris Saint-Germain ====
Midway through the 2000−01 season, Arteta went to French club [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] on an 18-month loan.<ref name="Arteta&Alonso" /> He joined a star-studded team managed by [[Luis Fernandez]], a team which included the likes of [[Mauricio Pochettino]], [[Gabriel Heinze]], [[Jay-Jay Okocha]] and [[Nicolas Anelka]]. Arteta would also later play with [[Ronaldinho]] when the Brazilian moved to [[Paris]] in the summer of 2001.<ref name=":Athletic1" /> He made his senior debut on 10 February 2001 against [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] in the round of 32 of the [[2000–01 Coupe de France|2000−01 Coupe de France]].{{citation needed|date=November 2024}} Arteta started the match at the [[Parc des Princes]] and played the entire game in which PSG lost 4−0. On 17 February 2001, Arteta made his [[Ligue 1|French Division 1]] debut coming off the bench in the 34th minute for [[Vampeta]] in a 1−0 defeat against [[Le Classique|rivals]] [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], away at the [[Stade Vélodrome]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Olympique Marseille v Paris St Germain, 17 February 2001 |url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/olympique-marseille-v-paris-st-germain-17-february-2001-5040/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210517160559/https://www.11v11.com/matches/olympique-marseille-v-paris-st-germain-17-february-2001-5040/ |archive-date=17 May 2021 |access-date=25 March 2023 |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises}}</ref> Arteta was used by Fernández primarily as a playmaker during his time in Paris;<ref>{{Cite book |title=100 Most Popular Expatriate Footballers in Spain |publisher=Focus On |year=2018 |edition=4th |page=2056 |language=en |asin=B078C8FX6V}}</ref> he played 11 games in his [[2000–01 Paris Saint-Germain F.C. season|first season]] and he scored his first senior goal on 12 May 2001 against [[Lille OSC|Lille]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Paris St Germain v Lille, 12 May 2001 |url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/paris-st-germain-v-lille-12-may-2001-7119/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213003936/https://www.11v11.com/matches/paris-st-germain-v-lille-12-may-2001-7119/ |archive-date=13 December 2018 |access-date=25 March 2023 |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises}}</ref> During Arteta's [[2001–02 Paris Saint-Germain F.C. season|second season]] with PSG, he won the [[2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in the summer, watching both two-legged final games against [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]] from the bench.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Petillo |first=Mario |date=8 April 2021 |title=Il Brescia e l'Intertoto 2001: quando Mazzone sfidò il PSG di Pochettino |language=Italian |trans-title=Brescia and the Intertoto 2001: when Mazzone challenged Pochettino's PSG |work= |publisher=Goal Italy |url=https://www.goal.com/it/notizie/il-brescia-e-lintertoto-2001-quando-mazzone-sfido-il-psg-di-pochettino/7d8saf9p3vuw1lqrp8yonooir |url-status=live |access-date=25 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230325084413/https://www.goal.com/it/notizie/il-brescia-e-lintertoto-2001-quando-mazzone-sfido-il-psg-di-pochettino/7d8saf9p3vuw1lqrp8yonooir |archive-date=25 March 2023}}</ref> He played 53 games in total for PSG and scored five goals.{{citation needed|date=November 2024}} PSG wanted to keep Arteta at the end of the loan period, and did have first refusal on the player.<ref name="parisien">{{cite news |last1=Bruna |first1=Eric |last2=Opoczynski |first2=David |last3=Nedjari |first3=Karim |date=20 March 2002 |title=Les Glasgow Rangers subtilisent Arteta au PSG |language=fr |trans-title=Glasgow Rangers steal Arteta from PSG |newspaper=Le Parisien |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/les-glasgow-rangers-subtilisent-arteta-au-psg-20-03-2002-2002911582.php |url-status=live |access-date=14 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230224144040/https://www.leparisien.fr/sports/les-glasgow-rangers-subtilisent-arteta-au-psg-20-03-2002-2002911582.php |archive-date=24 February 2023}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news |last=Campbell |first=Jordan |date=24 March 2023 |title=Mikel Arteta at Rangers and his title-clinching penalty: 'He pulled rank on everyone' |work=The Athletic |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/1508695/2023/03/24/mikel-arteta-rangers-celtic-penalty/ |url-access=subscription |access-date=25 March 2023}}</ref> Instead, he returned to Barcelona after his loan spell.

=== Rangers ===
Arteta signed for Scottish club Rangers in March 2002 in a £6 million transfer deal.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rangers sign Barca boy Arteta |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/mar/19/newsstory.sport5 |work=The Guardian |access-date=26 April 2015 |date=19 March 2002}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> He enjoyed a successful first season in [[Glasgow]] and quickly established himself as a first-team regular. Highlights were scoring on his [[Old Firm]] debut,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/2295515.stm |title=Old Firm in thrilling draw |work=BBC Sport |access-date=21 December 2014}}</ref> and converting a late penalty on the final day of the [[2002–03 Scottish Premier League|2002–03 season]], which proved vital for [[goal difference]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/2932016.stm |title=Rangers win to clinch title |work=BBC Sport |date=25 May 2003 |access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref> as Rangers completed the [[Treble (association football)|domestic treble]] of the [[Scottish Premier League]] title, [[Scottish Cup]] and [[Scottish League Cup]].

Arteta started his [[2003–04 in Scottish football|second season]] with Rangers by scoring six goals in the first six games of the season<ref>{{Soccerbase season|24034|2003|name=Mikel Arteta|access-date=21 December 2014}}</ref> as the club qualified for the [[2003–04 UEFA Champions League#Group E|Champions League group stages]], although they did not qualify from that group and ended the campaign without a trophy. Arteta returned to Spain after two seasons in Glasgow; he later credited his spell at Rangers as helping him develop as a player, stating "Scottish football was tough, really tough. It was really physical, people got at you and I had to improve on that a lot. I think I did that to get to the level that the Premier League required of me."<ref>{{cite web |title=Mikel Arteta: Rangers move made me a top flight player |url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/clubs/rangers/293316-mikel-arteta-rangers-move-made-me-a-top-flight-player/ |publisher=STV Sport |access-date=26 April 2015 |date=12 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070016/http://sport.stv.tv/football/clubs/rangers/293316-mikel-arteta-rangers-move-made-me-a-top-flight-player/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>

=== Real Sociedad ===
He joined [[Real Sociedad]] for €5.2&nbsp;million in 2004 with the idea being that Arteta and [[Xabi Alonso]] could play together. However, Alonso left for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and Arteta failed to establish himself in the team,<ref name=Arteta&Alonso/> starting only three league matches in the half-season he spent back in San Sebastián.<ref>[https://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/j2026.html?temp=2004-05 Arteta: Matches 2004–05], BDFutbol</ref>

[[Everton F.C.|Everton]] manager [[David Moyes]] signed Arteta in the 2005 January transfer window on loan with a view to a permanent transfer. Seen as a replacement for Danish midfielder [[Thomas Gravesen]] who had moved to [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/e/everton/4176451.stm |title=Gravesen completes switch to Real |work=BBC Sport |date=14 January 2005 |access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref> Arteta played a vital part in helping Everton achieve the possibility of qualifying for the Champions League when they finished fourth in the [[2004–05 FA Premier League|Premier League]]; however, they were knocked out controversially by [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] in the [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds#Third qualifying round|last qualifying round]].<ref name=Arteta&Alonso/> He scored his first Everton goal in a 4–0 victory over [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Everton 4–0 Crystal Palace |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4403623.stm |access-date=23 April 2019 |work=BBC Sport |date=10 April 2005}}</ref> and signed a permanent five-year deal in July 2005 for a fee of £2&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |title=David Moyes: We can have a go at Arsenal |url=https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2020/march/06-march/david-moyes-we-can-have-go-arsenal |access-date=4 April 2020 |work=West Ham United |date=6 March 2020}}</ref>

The [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] season saw Arteta pick up both the [[Everton F.C.#Player of the Season|Everton Player of the Season]] and the ''Players' Player of the Season'' awards.<ref name=EFC/> Arteta's good form extended into 2006–07. As well as retaining his starting place, he frequently turned in man-of-the-match displays, and finished the season with nine goals from the 35 league games he played. Arteta was awarded the ''Player of the Season Award'' for the second consecutive year.<ref name=EFC/> He was also voted the Premier League's 'Midfielder of the Year' by the viewers of [[Sky Sports]], beating [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] to the award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/arteta-named-best-midfield.html |publisher=Everton F.C. |title=Midfielder of the year |access-date=17 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018084006/http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/arteta-named-best-midfield.html |archive-date=18 October 2007 }}</ref>

Arteta's creativity was an essential part of Everton's attacking play the following season,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and he had scored six goals by the end of January.<ref name="evertonfc.com">[http://www.evertonfc.com/player-profile/mikel-arteta Mikel Arteta / Everton Squad, Everton Players / evertonfc.com – The Official Website of Everton Football Club]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016192213/http://www.evertonfc.com/player-profile/mikel-arteta |date=16 October 2009 }}. Everton F.C. 28 March 1982. Retrieved 11 June 2012.</ref> That improved further a season later, with Arteta scoring nine times in the 2006–07 season and once again ending the season as the Player of the Year. He helped Everton secure a place in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] and was ranked by the ACTIM Index as the sixth best player in the Premier League, but it did not earn him a call-up into the full Spain squad.<ref name="evertonfc.com"/> During the summer of 2007, he signed a new five-year contract.<ref name="evertonfc.com"/>

Arteta added another accolade to his growing collection during the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08 season]], when he picked up the ''North West Footballer of the Year'' award. He then became the first Everton player in five years to receive the [[Liverpool Echo]]'s ''Sports Personality of the Year'' award in January 2008.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Arteta suffered a stomach injury in the second half of the season, and shortly before the final game of the campaign, he underwent surgery to rectify the problem.<ref name="evertonfc.com"/> He scored his first goal of the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09 season]] in the [[Premier League]] opener versus [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] with a free kick. He was named [[Captain (association football)|captain]] for a 2–2 draw with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], scoring a penalty in the game. In February, Arteta was carried off on a stretcher in a 0–0 draw with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] having injured a ligament in his knee, days after his first inclusion in the Spain national team squad. The injury kept him out for the rest of the 2008–09 season and the first five months of 2009–10. Over the course of the season, Arteta began to play in the centre of the field again, usually being partnered with a defensive midfielder. This gave him the freedom to dictate the tempo of the game and connect with Pienaar and Osman on the wing.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Arteta made his return from injury in January 2010 as a substitute in an [[FA Cup]] tie against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], before starting in a 2–1 home Premier League win against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. His first two goals of the season were scored in a 5–1 win over [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] in March 2010. In August that year, he signed a five-year contract extension with Everton.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2010/08/13/arteta-contract-photo-exclusive |publisher=Everton F.C. |title=Arteta Contract Photo Exclusive |date=13 August 2010 |access-date=13 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134129/http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2010/08/13/arteta-contract-photo-exclusive |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>

The [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11 season]] proved to be not as successful as expected for both the team and the player. After early goals in the season, against Manchester United in a thriller 3–3 comeback at [[Goodison Park]], and in a 2–0 win in the [[Merseyside derby]], Arteta suffered a loss of form that would be crucial in Everton's push for a European spot. He began to show again glimpses of creative power in the final part of the season, when he was played again on the wing, enjoying more freedom and space.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Upon departing Everton, Arteta said "I am 29 years old so I haven't got much time left to take a chance like this one. I have done my best for Everton."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/14744368 |title=Arteta defends move to Arsenal |work=BBC Sport |date=1 September 2011 |access-date=1 December 2011}}</ref> A few weeks later, he stated that the spirit in Everton's dressing room is the 'best in football'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/everton-fc/everton-fc-news/2011/10/07/mikel-arteta-spirit-in-everton-fc-s-dressing-room-is-the-best-in-football-100252-29554361/ |title=Arteta believes Everton team spirit is the best in football |work=Liverpool Echo |date=7 October 2011 |access-date=1 December 2011}}</ref>

Arteta initially started out playing as a number 10 in the Barcelona youth system, and was later shifted to the position of a "pivot" or defensive midfielder, as he was thought to be a player in the mould of [[Pep Guardiola]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/22/mikel-arteta-integral-pep-guardiolas-transformation-manchester/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/22/mikel-arteta-integral-pep-guardiolas-transformation-manchester/ |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Mikel Arteta is integral to Pep Guardiola's transformation of Manchester City - and the man he sees as his successor |work=The Telegraph |last1=Burt |first1=Jason |date=22 November 2019 |access-date=18 July 2020 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> He was rated as the sixth most effective player in the [[Premier League]] in [[2006–07 FA Premier League|2006–07]] by the official player ratings system the Actim Index.

==Coaching and managerial career==
===Manchester City===
Arteta had three options upon retirement. He was offered to lead the Arsenal Academy, by [[Arsène Wenger]], join [[Mauricio Pochettino]]'s (his teammate from [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|PSG]]) backroom staff at [[Tottenham Hotspur]] or join Pep Guardiola's coaching team at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. On 3 July 2016, Arteta was appointed an assistant coach at Manchester City,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mancity.com/news/first-team/first-team-news/2016/july/mikel-arteta-joined-guardiola|title=Mikel Arteta joins City's coaching staff|last=Clayton|first=David|website=www.mancity.com|language=en|access-date=20 December 2019}}</ref> alongside [[Brian Kidd]] and [[Domènec Torrent]], who operated as deputies to [[Pep Guardiola]].

Guardiola and Arteta first met at the [[La Masia|Barcelona academy]], although Guardiola was already established in the first team, being 11 years older than Arteta. Since then, the two kept in touch. Guardiola was convinced Arteta – who was an Arsenal player at the time – would make a good coach when he called him to get information on Chelsea, prior to their [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League#Semi-finals|2012 Champions League semi-finals against Barcelona]].

In 2015, when Guardiola was exiting [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Arteta, in his final year as a player, re-connected and decided to work together.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/1459938/2019/12/20/mikel-arteta-arsenal-manager-manchester-city-pep-guardiola/|title=Mikel Arteta lived alone with tactical diagrams on the walls: what lies behind the eyes of Arsenal's new manager|last=McNicholas|first=Daniel Taylor and David Ornstein and James|website=The Athletic|access-date=20 December 2019}}</ref> Arteta stood in as Man City manager in a 2–1 [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] loss against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] on 19 September 2018, because of Guardiola's touchline ban.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37502102/lyon-shock-sloppy-manchester-city-nabil-fekir-delivers-goods-big-stage|title=Lyon shock sloppy Manchester City as Nabil Fekir delivers the goods on the big stage|date=19 September 2018|publisher=ESPN|access-date=19 September 2018}}</ref> At Man City, Arteta won two [[Premier League]] titles, an [[FA Cup]], and two [[EFL Cup]]s.

==Style of management==
As a manager, Arteta was influenced by his time playing under [[Arsène Wenger]] and serving as an assistant to [[Pep Guardiola]], as well as by the philosophy instilled in him during his spell with the [[La Masia|Barcelona youth academy]]; he had also drawn from tactical elements used by [[José Mourinho]].<ref name="Coaches' Voice"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Mikel Arteta: The rejection and determination that made a manager |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/65646318 |access-date=9 June 2025 |work=BBC Sport |date=24 May 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mikel Arteta reveals Jose Mourinho 'more than influenced' his managerial style |url=https://www.90min.com/mikel-arteta-reveals-jose-mourinho-more-than-influenced-managerial-style |publisher=90min.com |access-date=9 June 2025 |date=24 September 2024}}</ref> As head coach of Arsenal, Arteta mainly uses a [[4–3–3]] or [[Formation (association football)#4–2–3–1|4–3–2–1 formation]], although he has also been known to use a [[3–4–3 formation]] on occasion.
