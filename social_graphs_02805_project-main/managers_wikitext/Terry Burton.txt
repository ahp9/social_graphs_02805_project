'''Terry Burton''' (born 8 November 1952 in [[Camden Town]], [[North London]]) is an English [[association football|football]] manager and coach, who was most recently assistant manager at [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. Burton started his career at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and was the captain of Arsenal's [[FA Youth Cup]] winning team in 1971, before later beginning his coaching career at the club and going on to have further backroom spells at [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].

==Playing career==
Burton's playing career started as an [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] apprentice where he captained the 1971 [[FA Youth Cup]] winning team.<ref name="bbc"/> He wasn't offered a professional contract and joined [[Folkestone F.C.|Folkestone]] during the summer of 1971. He went on to play for [[Epping Town F.C.|Epping Town]], [[Hayes F.C.|Hayes]] and [[Leyton F.C.|Leyton Wingate]] (as player-coach). Towards the end of the 1970s he coached football at Holloway School.

==Coaching career==

===Arsenal===
Burton returned to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] as youth team coach in 1979. During his spell at the club, he was noted for having brought through future Arsenal and England captain [[Tony Adams]], who was later linked with wanting to bring Burton to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] as his assistant having been appointed the club's manager in 2008.<ref name="guardian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jan/25/aaron-ramsey-arsenal-cardiff|title=Welsh Rambo a perfect Gunner|author=Amy Lawrence|work=The Observer|date=25 January 2009|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref><ref name="telegraph">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/portsmouth/3415839/Portsmouth-manager-Tony-Adams-looks-to-bring-Terry-Burton-to-Fratton-ParkFootball.html|title=Portsmouth manager Tony Adams turns to former Arsenal mentor Terry Burton|author=Emily Benammar|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=10 November 2008|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> Following [[Don Howe]]'s appointment as Arsenal manager, he was promoted to first team coach, then reserve team coach in 1986 when [[George Graham]] became Arsenal manager, though was released for the second time by the club in 1987.

===Wimbledon===
After three months managing non-league [[Wealdstone F.C.|Wealdstone]] Burton was appointed reserve team coach at [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]. He subsequently held the positions of Youth Team manager, Assistant Manager under [[Joe Kinnear]] (during which time the club achieved 3 top ten finishes in the Premier League and reached both the League Cup and FA Cup semi-finals), Technical Director and Academy Director at the club before he was temporarily charged with managing the first team after the Norwegian [[Egil Olsen]]'s dismissal with only two games remaining of the club's 1999–2000 [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] campaign, given the task of keeping Wimbledon in the Premier League. A last minute goal from [[John Hartson]] against [[Aston Villa]] at [[Selhurst Park]] in Burton's first game in charge gave the Dons hope of staying up as long as they matched the result of [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] against [[Liverpool]] in the final game of the year. A defeat at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on the final day of the season, and a shock 1–0 win at [[Valley Parade]] for Bradford meant that Wimbledon's fight against relegation was lost. Despite this, during pre-season Burton was given the role of first team manager permanently.

====Managerial career====
Wimbledon achieved respectable top-ten finishes in both of their first two seasons outside the top flight since 1985–86, playing a short passing game, rather than the long-ball the Dons were well known for, but never really made a serious promotion challenge. Although he was popular with the club's fans, Burton incurred the wrath of the chairman after speaking out against the club's proposed relocation to Milton Keynes, and he was promptly sacked just after the end of the 2001–02 season. He was replaced by goalkeeping coach [[Stuart Murdoch (football manager)|Stuart Murdoch]].

===Watford===
Burton spent two years with [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] as assistant manager to [[Ray Lewington]]. His role at [[Vicarage Road]] had begun during the summer of 2002, shortly after he was sacked as manager of [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]].

===Cardiff City===
Burton joined [[Cardiff City|Cardiff]] as assistant manager during the 2004–2005 season, during [[Lennie Lawrence]]'s spell at the club. He has been credited at Cardiff for having brought through [[Aaron Ramsey]], and helped recommend Ramsey to Arsenal manager [[Arsène Wenger]], having retained a longstanding connection to the club.<ref name="guardian"/> During transfer negotiations in the 2008–2009 season, Burton also advised that Ramsey join Arsenal, citing the similarity between the player and the club's overall style of play.<ref name="guardian"/> On 30 May 2011, [[Dave Jones (footballer, born 1956)|Dave Jones]] was sacked and a month later, Burton was placed on gardening leave under new boss, [[Malky Mackay]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Cardiff City reshuffle backroom staff |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/13939316 |work=BBC Sport |date=28 June 2011 |access-date=1 December 2013}}</ref>

===West Bromwich Albion===
