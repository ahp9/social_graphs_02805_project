'''Sir Alexander Chapman Ferguson''' (born 31 December 1941) is a Scottish former professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and [[Association football|player]], best known for managing [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] from 1986 to 2013. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time, having won more trophies than any other manager in the history of football.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=https://www.marca.com/en/football/international-football/2019/05/23/5ce5c24eca4741c7638b4567.html |title=Guardiola on his way to becoming the most successful coach of all time |publisher=Marca |last1=Rubio |first1=Alberto|last2=Clancy|first2=Conor|date=23 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Corless |first=Liam |date=2024-06-02 |title=The 15 best football managers of all time have been ranked in order |url=https://www.givemesport.com/football-best-managers-ever-ranked/ |access-date=2025-05-23 |website=GiveMeSport |language=en}}</ref> Ferguson is often credited for valuing youth during his time at Manchester United, particularly in the 1990s with the "[[Fergie's Fledglings#The_1990s_Fledglings|Class of '92]]", who contributed to making the club one of the most successful in the world.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news |date=2005-09-14 |title=Why youth is the key for Sir Alex |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/get_involved/4200614.stm |access-date=2022-05-06}}</ref>

Ferguson played as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for several Scottish clubs, including [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. While playing for Dunfermline, he was the top goalscorer in the Scottish league during the [[1965–66 in Scottish football|1965–66]] season. Towards the end of his playing career, he also worked as a coach, then started his managerial career with [[East Stirlingshire F.C.|East Stirlingshire]] and [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]. Ferguson then enjoyed a highly successful period as manager of [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], winning three [[List of Scottish football champions|Scottish league championships]], four [[Scottish Cup]]s and both the [[1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] and the [[UEFA Super Cup]] in [[1983 European Super Cup|1983]]. He briefly managed [[Scotland men's national football team|Scotland]] following the death of [[Jock Stein]], taking the team to the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]].

Ferguson was appointed [[List of Manchester United F.C. managers|manager]] of Manchester United in November 1986. During his 26 years with Manchester United, he won 38 trophies, including 13 [[Premier League]] titles, five [[FA Cup]]s, and two [[UEFA Champions League]] titles. He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[1999 Birthday Honours|1999 Queen's Birthday Honours]] list for his services to the game.<ref name=":2">{{cite news |title=Sir Alex's crowning glory |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/398955.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=20 July 1999 |access-date=6 November 2012}}</ref> Ferguson is the longest-serving manager of Manchester United, having overtaken Sir [[Matt Busby]]'s record on 19 December 2010. He retired from management at the end of the [[2012–13 Manchester United F.C. season|2012–13 season]], having won the Premier League in his final season.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Ferguson's playing career began as an amateur with [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], where he made his debut as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]], aged 16.<ref name=QPFC>{{cite web|url=http://www.qpfc.com/appearances/f/fergusonac.htm|title=Ferguson, Alexander Chapman|website=QPFC.com – A Historical Queen's Park FC Website|access-date=12 February 2018|archive-date=13 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213080020/http://www.qpfc.com/appearances/f/fergusonac.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> He described his first match as a "nightmare",<ref name="nightmare">Crick, p. 33</ref> but scored Queen's Park's goal in a 2–1 defeat against [[Stranraer F.C.|Stranraer]]. Perhaps his most notable game for Queen's Park was the 7–1 defeat away to [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] on Boxing Day 1959 when ex-England international [[Ivor Broadis]] scored four of the Queen of the South goals. Ferguson was the solitary Queen's Park goalscorer.<ref name=":11">{{cite web |url=http://qosfc.com/new_legendsview.aspx?playerid=1035 |title=Details of Queen of the South 7 v 1 Queens Park including Ferguson's recollection in the Ivor Broadis career profile |publisher=Qosfc.com |access-date=4 October 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120713020053/http://qosfc.com/new_legendsview.aspx?playerid=1035 |archive-date=13 July 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Despite scoring 20 [[goal (sport)|goals]] in his 31 games for Queen's Park, he could not command a regular place in the side and moved to [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] in 1960. Ferguson was on a part-time contract with St Johnstone, and he combined working in a Govan shipyard with training at night in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=herald>{{cite news |last=Rowat |first=Alison |title=Sir Alex Ferguson: The truth about Rangers and me - Aberdeen legend speaks out in new film |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19330685.sir-alex-ferguson-truth-rangers/ |newspaper=The Herald |date=27 May 2021 |access-date=27 May 2021}}</ref> Although he regularly scored goals for St Johnstone, he was unable to command a consistent place in their team.

[[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline]] signed him the following summer (1964), and Ferguson became a full-time professional footballer. In the following season ([[1964–65 in Scottish football|1964–65]]) Dunfermline were strong challengers for the [[List of Scottish football champions|Scottish league title]] and reached the [[1965 Scottish Cup final|Scottish Cup final]], but Ferguson was dropped for the final after a poor performance in a league game against St Johnstone. Dunfermline lost the final 3–2 to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], then failed to win the League by one point. The [[1965–66 in Scottish football|1965–66]] season saw Ferguson notch up 45 goals in 51 games for Dunfermline. Along with [[Joe McBride (footballer, born 1938)|Joe McBride]] of Celtic, he was the top goalscorer in the Scottish league with 31 goals.<ref name="top goalscorer">{{cite web |title=Scotland&nbsp;– List of Topscorers |url=https://www.rsssf.org/tabless/scottops.html |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |date=12 June 2009 |access-date=30 October 2009}}</ref>

Ferguson then joined Rangers for £65,000, which was a record fee for a transfer between two Scottish clubs.<ref name=topplayers/> He performed well in Europe during his two seasons with the club, scoring six goals in nine appearances in the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] including two against [[1.FC Köln]] in the [[1967–68 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1967–68]] competition, and an important strike against [[Athletic Bilbao]] in the [[1968–69 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1968–69 edition]] which helped Rangers into the semi-finals,<ref name=":13">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/mar/14/manchester-united-athletic-bilbao|title=Sir Alex Ferguson looks for feat of escapology to beat Athletic Bilbao|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 March 2012|access-date=23 February 2018}}</ref> but on both occasions they were knocked out by English opposition. He was blamed for a goal conceded in the [[1968–69 Scottish Cup#Final|1969 Scottish Cup final]],<ref name="blame">Crick, p. 82</ref> in a match in which he was designated to mark Celtic [[Captain (association football)|captain]], [[Billy McNeill]], and was subsequently forced to play for the club's junior side instead of for the first team.<ref name="junior">Crick, p. 83</ref> According to his brother, Ferguson was so upset by the experience that he threw his losers' medal away.<ref name="losersmedal">Crick, p. 86</ref>

There have been claims that he suffered [[Rangers F.C. signing policy|discrimination at Rangers]] due to his marriage to a Catholic, Cathy Holding.<ref name=":14">{{cite book|first=Harry|last=Reid|year=2005|title=The Final Whistle?|publisher=Birlinn|page=223|isbn=1-84158-362-6}}</ref> Ferguson said in a 2021 documentary film  about his life and career (''[[Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In]]'') that he "assumed" that his exclusion from the first team after the 1969 cup final was due to her religion.<ref name=herald/> His autobiography noted that Rangers had known of his wife's religion when he joined the club.<ref name=":15">Ferguson, pp. 106–107</ref> In March 2021, he added that when he was signed, a Rangers director had questioned whether the Fergusons had been married in a (Catholic) [[chapel]], and that the director had replied "oh, that's okay" when told they had married in a [[registry office]].<ref name=":16">{{cite news |last= |first= |date= |title=Sir Alex Ferguson |url=https://nationalfootballmuseum.com/halloffame/sir-alex-ferguson/ |access-date=27 May 2021 |newspaper=Glasgow Times}}</ref> Ferguson left Rangers reluctantly, as he had grown up locally and had dreamed of succeeding there.<ref name=it2003/> He was upset by how newspapers would refer to him as an "ex-Rangers player" after he had left, and rarely attended gatherings of their former players.<ref name = it2003>{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/ferguson-denies-sentiment-until-blue-in-the-face-1.385734 |title=Ferguson denies sentiment until blue in the face |first=Daniel |last=Taylor |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |date=22 October 2003 |access-date=27 May 2021}}</ref>

The following October, [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] wanted to sign Ferguson,<ref name=signforest>Crick, p. 85</ref> but his wife was not keen on moving to England at that time, so he went to [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] instead. He remained at Brockville for four years, gaining more league appearances than he had elsewhere; in recognition of his experience he was promoted to player-coach, but when [[John Prentice (footballer born 1926)|John Prentice]] became manager he removed Ferguson's coaching responsibilities. Ferguson's time at Falkirk was soured by this, and he responded by requesting a transfer and moved to [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]], where he finished his playing career in 1974.<ref>{{cite book|title=The wit and wisdom of Sir Alex Ferguson|year=2013|publisher=Biteback Publishing|last=Riley|first=Chris|isbn=978-1-84954-627-0|location=London |oclc=852756978 }}</ref>

===International===
Ferguson's only involvement with the [[Scotland men's national football team|Scotland national team]] was during an overseas tour in 1967. For many years none of the tour matches were recognised by the [[Scottish Football Association]] as full internationals, and so Ferguson was deemed to have never played for Scotland. A ''[[BBC Sport]]'' article in June 2020 identified him as one of the best Scottish players to have never played a full international.<ref name=topplayers>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/53132189 |title=Scotland: Top players never to be capped by their country |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=25 June 2020 |access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref> The SFA announced in October 2021 that some of the tour matches would be reclassified as full internationals, which meant that Ferguson was belatedly awarded an international cap.<ref name="1967 reclassified" />

==Managerial career==

===East Stirlingshire===
In June 1974, Ferguson was appointed manager of [[East Stirlingshire F.C.|East Stirlingshire]], at the comparatively young age of 32. It was a part-time job that paid £40 per week, and the club did not have a single [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] at the time.<ref name="boss108-9">Crick, pp. 108–9</ref> He gained a reputation as a disciplinarian, with club forward [[Bobby McCulley]] later saying he had "never been afraid of anyone before but Ferguson was a frightening bastard from the start."<ref name="bastard">{{cite news|title=A leader of men is what he does best|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=23 November 2004|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/nov/23/newsstory.sport|access-date=9 March 2007|first1=Sid|last1=Lowe|first2=Matt|last2=Scott|first3=Daniel|last3=Taylor|first4=Jon|last4=Brodkin}}</ref>

===St Mirren===
In October 1974, Ferguson was invited to manage [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]. While they were below [[East Stirlingshire F.C.|East Stirlingshire]] in the league, they were a bigger club and although Ferguson felt a degree of loyalty towards East Stirlingshire, he decided to join St Mirren after taking advice from [[Jock Stein]].<ref name="boss117">Crick, p. 117</ref>

Ferguson was manager of St Mirren from 1974 until 1978, producing a remarkable transformation of a team in the lower half of the old [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]] watched by crowds of just over 1,000, to [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] champions in [[1976–77 in Scottish football|1977]], discovering talent like [[Billy Stark]], [[Tony Fitzpatrick (footballer)|Tony Fitzpatrick]], [[Lex Richardson]], [[Frank McGarvey]], Bobby Reid and [[Peter Weir (footballer)|Peter Weir]] while playing superb attacking football.<ref name="Sunday Herald St Mirren article">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_19990530/ai_n13939368 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107114145/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_19990530/ai_n13939368 |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 January 2008 |title=Sunday Herald St Mirren article |access-date=9 November 2007 |first=Billy |last=Adams |date=30 May 1999 |work=The Sunday Herald }}</ref> The average age of the league winning team was 19 and the captain, Fitzpatrick, was 20.<ref name="FA article">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/Features/Postings/2004/05/GafferTapes_SirAlexFerguson.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20050406154845/http://www.thefa.com/Features/Postings/2004/05/GafferTapes_SirAlexFerguson.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 April 2005|title=Sir Alex lifts the lid|date=4 May 2004|access-date=9 November 2007}}</ref>

St Mirren have the distinction of being the only club ever to sack Ferguson. He claimed wrongful dismissal against the club at an industrial tribunal but lost and was given no leave to appeal. According to a ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' article on 30 May 1999, the official version is that Ferguson was sacked for various breaches of contract, including unauthorised payments to players.<ref name="Sunday Herald St Mirren article"/> He was counter-accused of intimidating behaviour towards his office secretary because he wanted players to get some expenses tax free. He did not speak to her for six weeks, confiscated her keys and communicated only through a 17-year-old assistant. The tribunal concluded that Ferguson was "particularly petty" and "immature".<ref name="Guardian bullying article">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jan/12/swimming|title=Guardian bullying article|access-date=11 November 2007|location=London|date=12 January 2006|work=The Guardian|first=Nicky|last=Campbell}}</ref> It was claimed during the tribunal by St Mirren chairman, Willie Todd, that Ferguson had "no managerial ability".<ref>{{cite web |title=Sir Alex Ferguson: dates that defined an icon |url=https://www.fifa.com/news/sir-alex-ferguson-dates-that-defined-icon-2075842 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326001153/https://www.fifa.com/news/sir-alex-ferguson-dates-that-defined-icon-2075842 |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 March 2019 |website=FIFA.com |access-date=26 March 2019 |date=8 May 2013}}</ref>

In 2008, ''[[The Guardian]]'' published an interview with Todd (then aged 87), who had sacked Ferguson many years earlier. Todd said that the fundamental reason for the dismissal was a breach of contract relating to Ferguson having agreed to join Aberdeen. Ferguson told journalist Jim Rodger of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' that he had asked at least one member of the squad to go to Aberdeen with him. He told the St Mirren staff he was leaving. Todd expressed regret over what happened but blamed Aberdeen for not approaching his club to discuss compensation.<ref>{{cite news|title=31.05.1978: Alex Ferguson is fired by St Mirren|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/31/manchesterunited.stmirren|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=31 May 2008|access-date=29 December 2008}}</ref>

In 1977, Ferguson turned down the manager's job at Aberdeen. The role went to Billy McNeill, who returned to Celtic after only a year, leaving the role available for Ferguson once again.<ref>{{cite news |first=Harry |last=Reid |title=The goal that Alex Ferguson has been chasing all his life |work=Glasgow Herald |page=9 |date=11 April 1983 |access-date=8 January 2014 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19830411&id=GsRAAAAAIBAJ&pg=3291,1799200 }}</ref>

===Aberdeen===

====Late 1970s====
Ferguson joined Aberdeen as manager in June 1978. Although Aberdeen were one of Scotland's major clubs they had won the league only once, in [[1954–55 in Scottish football|1955]] under [[Dave Halliday]]. The team had been playing well, however, and had not lost a league match since the previous December, having finished second in the league the previous season.<ref name="boss159">Crick, p. 159</ref> Ferguson had now been a manager for four years, but was still not much older than some of the players and had trouble winning the respect of some of the older ones such as [[Joe Harper]].<ref name="boss171">Crick, p. 171</ref> The season did not go especially well, with Aberdeen reaching the semi-final of the [[Scottish Cup]] and the [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (March)|Scottish League Cup Final]], but losing both matches and [[1978–79 Scottish Premier Division|finishing fourth in the league]].

Aberdeen lost the [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (December)|1979–80 Scottish League Cup Final]], this time to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] after a replay. Ferguson took the blame for the defeat, saying he should have made changes to the team for the replay.<ref name="boss174">Crick, p. 174</ref>

====1980s and silverware====
Aberdeen had started the [[1979–80 Scottish Football League|1979–80 season]] poorly but their form improved dramatically in the new year and they won the Scottish league that season with a 5–0 win on the final day. It was the first time in 15 years that the league had not been won by either Rangers or Celtic. Ferguson now felt that he had the respect of his players, later saying: "That was the achievement which united us. I finally had the players believing in me".<ref name="boss175">Crick, p. 175</ref>

He was still a strict disciplinarian, though, and his players nicknamed him "Furious Fergie".<ref name="FuriousFergie">{{cite web |last=Haugstad |first=Thore |url=https://timeontheball.net/2017/06/16/furious-fergie/ |title=Furious Fergie: The early years of Sir Alex Ferguson |date=16 June 2017 |access-date=15 December 2020 |work=Time On The Ball |archive-date=5 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201205021924/http://timeontheball.net/2017/06/16/furious-fergie/ |url-status=usurped }}</ref> He fined one of his players, [[John Hewitt (footballer)|John Hewitt]], for overtaking him on a public road,<ref name="boss179">Crick, p. 179</ref> and kicked a tea urn at the players at half time after a poor first half.<ref name="boss180">Crick, p. 180</ref> He was dissatisfied with the atmosphere at Aberdeen matches, and deliberately created a "[[siege mentality]]" by accusing the Scottish media of being biased towards the Glasgow clubs, to motivate the team.<ref name="boss191">Crick, p. 191</ref> The team continued their success with a Scottish Cup win in [[1982 Scottish Cup final|1982]].

====European success and Scottish national side====
Ferguson led Aberdeen to even greater success the following season, 1982–83. They had qualified for the [[1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] as a result of winning the Scottish Cup the previous season, and impressively knocked out [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Reynolds |title=Magnificent Dons eclipse German stars |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19830303&id=mMFAAAAAIBAJ&pg=3582,722075 |newspaper=The Herald |date=3 March 1983 |access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Reynolds |title=Aberdeen emerge as the best of British |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19830317&printsec=frontpage |newspaper=The Herald |date=17 March 1983 |access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref> who had beaten [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] 4–1 in the previous round.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Lacey |title=Tottenham run on reserve |newspaper=The Guardian |page=22 |date=21 October 1982}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Lacey |title=Spurs lost in Munich fog |newspaper=The Guardian |page=26 |date=4 November 1982}}</ref> According to [[Willie Miller]], this gave them the confidence to believe that they could go on to win the competition,<ref name="boss201">Crick, p. 201</ref> which they did, with a 2–1 victory over [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] in the [[1983 European Cup Winners' Cup final|final]] on 11 May 1983.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Reynolds |title=Dons the Real European masters |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19860512&id=mcRAAAAAIBAJ&pg=4082,2406962 |newspaper=The Herald |date=12 May 1983 |access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref> Aberdeen became only the third Scottish team to win a European trophy and Ferguson now felt that "he'd done something worthwhile with his life".<ref name="boss203">Crick, p. 203</ref> This was followed up with victory in the [[1983 European Super Cup|European Super Cup]] in December 1983, when [[Hamburger SV]], the [[1983 European Cup final|reigning European Cup]] champions, were beaten 2–0 over two legs.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Reynolds |title=Aberdeen are set for superstardom |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19831123&id=O_s9AAAAIBAJ&pg=3873,4955762 |newspaper=The Herald |date=23 November 1983 |access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Reynolds |title=Aberdeen's super heroes take the glory |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19831221&id=8sFAAAAAIBAJ&pg=4085,4146762 |newspaper=The Herald |date=21 December 1983 |access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref> Aberdeen had also performed well in the league that season, and retained the Scottish Cup with a [[1983 Scottish Cup final|1–0 victory]] over Rangers,<ref>{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Reynolds |title=Don't put the blame on Russell – Greig |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19830523&printsec=frontpage |newspaper=The Herald |date=23 May 1983 |access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref> but Ferguson was not happy with his team's play in that match and upset the players by describing theirs as a "disgraceful performance" in a televised interview after the match, a statement he later retracted.<ref name="boss204">Crick, p. 204</ref>

After a sub-standard start to the [[1983–84 in Scottish football|1983–84 season]], Aberdeen's form improved and the team won the Scottish league and retained the Scottish Cup. Ferguson was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[1985 New Year Honours]],<ref name="OBE">{{London Gazette |issue=49969 |date=31 December 1984 |page=9 |supp=y }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/561724.stm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629104858/http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/561724.stm|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 June 2012|title=Lewis heads sporting honours|access-date=18 June 2007|date=12 December 1999|work=BBC News}}</ref> and was offered the managers' jobs at Rangers and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] during the season.<ref>{{cite web |last=Murray |first=Ewan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/10/sir-alex-ferguson-arsenal-manager |title=Sir Alex Ferguson rejected 1986 chance to become Arsenal manager |work=The Guardian |date=10 May 2011 |access-date=4 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Ley |first=John |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/8505871/Manchester-United-Sir-Alex-Ferguson-turned-down-the-opportunity-to-manage-Arsenal.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/8505871/Manchester-United-Sir-Alex-Ferguson-turned-down-the-opportunity-to-manage-Arsenal.html |archive-date=10 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Manchester United Sir Alex Ferguson turned down the opportunity to manage Arsenal |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 May 2011 |access-date=25 June 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Reynolds |first=Jim |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/why-i-didn-t-go-to-rangers-sir-alex-ferguson-on-advocaat-s-successor-the-scotland-job-and-the-old-firm-in-the-premiership-1.200147 |title=Why I didn't go to Rangers:Sir Alex Ferguson on Advocaat's successor, the Scotland job, and the Old Firm in the Premiership |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |date=2 February 2001 |access-date=25 June 2014}}</ref> Aberdeen retained their league title in the 1984–85 season. In [[1985–86 in Scottish football|1985–86]], Aberdeen won both domestic cups, but finished fourth in the league. Ferguson had been appointed to the club's board of directors early in 1986, but that April he told [[Dick Donald]], their chairman, that he intended to leave that summer.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Ferguson had been part of the coaching staff for the [[Scotland men's national football team|Scottish national side]] during qualifying for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]], but manager [[Jock Stein]] had [[1985 Wales v Scotland football match|collapsed and died on 10 September 1985]] – at the end of the game in which Scotland qualified from their group for a play-off against [[Australia men's national soccer team|Australia]]. Ferguson promptly agreed to take charge of the Scottish national side against the Australians and subsequently at the World Cup. To allow him to fulfil his international duties he appointed [[Archie Knox]] as his co-manager at Aberdeen. However, after Scotland failed to progress past the group stages of the World Cup, Ferguson stepped down as national team manager on 15 June 1986.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YNJAAAAAIBAJ&pg=6630,3393659|title=Fergie Steps Down|date=16 June 1986|work=Evening Times|access-date=10 June 2011}}</ref>

Around this time, Tottenham Hotspur offered Ferguson the chance to take over from [[Peter Shreeves]] as manager, but he rejected this offer and the job went to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]'s [[David Pleat]] instead. There was also an offer for Ferguson to replace [[Don Howe]] as Arsenal manager, but he rejected this offer as well, and fellow Scot [[George Graham (footballer, born 1944)|George Graham]] took the post instead.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/8092670.stm|title=Ferguson 'almost became Arsenal boss'|access-date=10 June 2009|work=BBC News|date=10 June 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090613050103/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/8092670.stm| archive-date= 13 June 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> That summer, there had been speculation that he would take over from [[Ron Atkinson]] at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], who had slumped to fourth in the English top flight after a ten-match winning start.<ref name=":13" />

It was not the first time that Ferguson had been linked with a move to England. In February 1982, Wolverhampton Wanderers had approached him about succeeding [[John Barnwell]] as manager as they were heading for relegation from the First Division.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tributes to former Wolves chief Harry Marshall|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2010/09/30/tributes-to-former-wolves-chief-harry-marshall|work=Express & Star|access-date=8 May 2011|date=30 September 2010}}</ref> He rejected this offer, perhaps concerned about the club's financial stability, as they were more than £2&nbsp;million in debt at the time and narrowly avoided going out of business. At the end of the 1984–85 season, it was reported that Ferguson was being considered for the [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] manager's job after the retirement of [[Joe Fagan]] was announced, but the job was quickly accepted by Liverpool striker [[Kenny Dalglish]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YLZAAAAAIBAJ&pg=5732,6946410|title=Dalglish in frame to replace Fagan as manager|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=30 May 1985|page=20|via=Google News}}</ref>

Although Ferguson remained at Aberdeen over the summer, he did eventually join Manchester United when Atkinson was sacked in November 1986.<ref>{{cite news|last=Paul|first=Ian|title=Ferguson agrees to Old Trafford move|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=96RAAAAAIBAJ&pg=4349%2C1816052|access-date=26 March 2019|work=The Glasgow Herald|date=7 November 1986|page=32}}</ref>

===Manchester United===

====Appointment and first FA Cup title====
Ferguson was appointed manager at [[Old Trafford]] on 6 November 1986.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021 |title=35 years since Sir Alex became United boss |url=https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/sir-alex-ferguson-35-years-since-legendary-man-utd-manager-appointed-6-november-2021}}</ref> He was initially worried that many of the players, such as [[Norman Whiteside]], [[Paul McGrath (footballer)|Paul McGrath]] and [[Bryan Robson]] were drinking too much and was "depressed" by their level of fitness, but he managed to increase the players' discipline and United climbed up the table to finish the season in 11th place, having been 21st (second from bottom) when he took over.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Herbert |first=Ian |date=2016 |title=Sir Alex Ferguson 'massively exaggerated' Manchester United drinking culture, says Ron Atkinson |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/sir-alex-ferguson-s-manchester-united-drinking-culture-claim-was-a-massive-exaggeration-says-ron-atkinson-a7308871.html}}</ref>

His first game in charge was a 2–0 defeat at [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] on 8 November, followed seven days later by a goalless draw at newly promoted [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], and then his first win (1–0 at home to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]) on 22 November.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Marshall |first=Adam |date=2021 |title=35 years since Sir Alex's first United game |url=https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/35th-anniversary-of-sir-alex-ferguson-first-game-as-man-utd-manager-against-oxford}}</ref> Results steadily improved as the season went on, and by the time they recorded what would be their only away win of the league campaign at title challengers and rivals Liverpool on [[Boxing Day]], it was clear that United were on the road to recovery.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web |date=2023 |title=Manchester United football club match record: 1987 |url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/manchester-united/tab/matches/season/1987/}}</ref> The year 1987 began on a high note with a 4–1 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and United gradually pulled together in the second half of the season, with relatively occasional defeats on the way, and finished 11th in the final table. Ferguson's mother Elizabeth died of lung cancer, aged 64, three weeks after his appointment. Ferguson hired Archie Knox, his assistant at Aberdeen, in the same role at Manchester United in 1986.<ref name=":7" />

In the 1987–88 season, Ferguson made several major signings, including [[Steve Bruce]], [[Viv Anderson]] and [[Brian McClair]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024 |title=Steve Bruce |url=https://www.manutd.com/en/players-and-staff/detail/steve-bruce}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Viv Anderson Manchester United Signed and Framed Photograph |url=https://vivanderson.co.uk/product/viv-anderson-manchester-united-signed-and-framed-photograph/ |access-date=2024-10-17 |website=Viv Anderson |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Brian McClair Signed Manchester United Picture |url=https://www.superstarspeakers.co.uk/product-page/brian-mcclair-signed-manchester-united-picture-1 |access-date=2024-10-17 |website=Superstar Speakers |language=en}}</ref> The new players made a positive contribution to a United team who finished in second place, nine points behind Liverpool. Liverpool's points lead, however, had been in double digits for most of the season and while United had lost only five league games all season, they drew 12 games, leaving some way to go before United could match their northwestern rivals.{{citation needed|date=November 2024}}

During the season, United played two friendly matches in Bermuda against the [[Bermuda national football team|Bermuda national team]] and the Somerset Cricket Club.<ref name=Bermuda>{{cite web |url=http://footysphere.com/post/13169778853/alex-ferguson-bermuda-man-utd |title=Manchester United Tour of Bermuda 1987 |work=footysphere.com |access-date=23 July 2016 |archive-date=16 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416105542/http://footysphere.com/post/13169778853/alex-ferguson-bermuda-man-utd |url-status=dead}}</ref> In the match against Somerset, both Ferguson himself and his assistant Archie Knox took to the field, with Knox even getting on the scoresheet. The match was Ferguson's only appearance for the Manchester United first team.<ref name=Bermuda/>

United were expected to do well when [[Mark Hughes]] returned to the club two years after leaving for [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], alongside [[Jim Leighton]] from [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]]; but the [[1988–89 Manchester United F.C. season|1988–89 season]] was a disappointment for them, finishing 11th in the league and losing 1–0 at home to Nottingham Forest in the [[1988–89 FA Cup#Sixth round proper|FA Cup sixth round]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hill |first=Courtney |date=2023 |title=Transfer Tales: How Hughes returned to United |url=https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/transfer-tales-on-mark-hughes-and-his-return-to-man-utd}}</ref> They had begun the season slowly, going on a nine-match winless run throughout October and November (with one defeat and eight draws) before a run of generally good results took them to third place and the fringes of the title challenge by mid February. However, another run of disappointing results in the final quarter of the season saw them fall down to mid-table.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-10-07 |title=Manchester United - Fixtures & Results 1988/1989 |url=https://www.worldfootball.net/teams/te1268/manchester-united/all-matches/ |access-date=2024-10-17 |website=worldfootball.net |language=en}}</ref>

For the [[1989–90 Manchester United F.C. season|1989–90 season]], Ferguson further boosted his squad by paying large sums of money for midfielders [[Neil Webb]], [[Mike Phelan]], and [[Paul Ince]], as well as defender [[Gary Pallister]] and winger [[Danny Wallace (footballer)|Danny Wallace]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Team |first=Editorial |date=2023 |title=Remembering Ince's United achievements |url=https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/paul-ince-extract-from-30-years-of-premier-league-book-ahead-of-reading-tie}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024 |title=Gary Pallister |url=https://www.manutd.com/en/players-and-staff/detail/gary-pallister}}</ref> The season began well with a 4–1 win over defending champions Arsenal on the opening day, but United's league form quickly turned sour. In September, United suffered a humiliating 5–1 away defeat against [[Manchester derby|fierce rivals]] [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Following this and an early season run of six defeats and two draws in eight games, a banner declaring, "Three years of excuses and it's still crap&nbsp;... ta-ra Fergie." was displayed at Old Trafford, and many journalists and supporters called for Ferguson to be sacked.<ref name="3years">{{cite news|title=Arise Sir Alex?|work=BBC News|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/05/99/uniteds_treble_triumph/354282.stm|access-date=3 December 2005|date=27 May 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Sir Alex Ferguson's 20 years at Manchester United|work=BBC Sport|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/6113634.stm|access-date=11 August 2011|date=6 November 2006}}</ref> Ferguson later described December 1989 as "the darkest period [he had] ever suffered in the game", as United ended the decade just outside the relegation zone.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ferguson hungry for more success|work=BBC News|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/8062015.stm|access-date=11 August 2011|date=22 May 2009|first=David|last=Ornstein}}</ref><ref name="jc27">{{cite book|first1=Alex|last1=Ferguson|first2=Peter|last2=Fitton|title=Just Champion!|publisher=Manchester United Football Club plc|year=1993|isbn=0-9520509-1-9|page=27}}</ref>

Although United's league form improved greatly in [[1990–91 Manchester United F.C. season|1990–91]], they were still inconsistent and finished sixth. There were some excellent performances that season, including a 6–2 demolition of Arsenal at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]], but results like an early 2–1 loss at newly promoted [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], a 4–0 September hammering by Liverpool at Anfield, and a 2–0 home defeat by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in early March (the game where 17-year-old talented prospect [[Ryan Giggs]] made his senior debut) showed that United still had some way to go.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-10-07 |title=Manchester United - Fixtures & Results 1990/1991 |url=https://www.worldfootball.net/teams/te1268/manchester-united/all-matches/ |access-date=2024-10-15 |website=worldfootball.net |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Diller |first=Kyle |title=Manchester United History: 1990-99 |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1180672-manchester-united-history-1990-99 |access-date=2024-10-15 |website=Bleacher Report |language=en}}</ref>

The [[1991–92 Manchester United F.C. season|1991–92 season]] did not live up to Ferguson's expectations and, in Ferguson's words, "many in the media felt that [his] mistakes had contributed to the misery".<ref name="mml311">Ferguson, p. 311</ref> United won the [[1992 Football League Cup final|League Cup]] and [[1991 European Super Cup|European Super Cup]];<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024 |title=Manchester United football club match record: 1992 |url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/manchester-united/tab/matches/season/1992/}}</ref> both for the first time, but lost out on the [[1991–92 Football League#First Division 2|league title]] to rivals [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] after leading the table for much of the season. A shortage of goals and being held to draws by teams they had been expected to beat in the second half of the campaign had proved to be the undoing of a United side who had performed so well in the first half of the season. Ferguson felt that his failure to secure the signing of [[Mick Harford]] from [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] had cost United the league, and that he needed "an extra dimension" to the team if they were to win the league the following season.<ref name="mml320">Ferguson, p. 320</ref>

During the 1992 close season, Ferguson went on the hunt for a new striker. He first attempted to sign [[Alan Shearer]] from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], but lost out to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Redmond |first=Robert |date=2018-09-23 |title=The exact reason why Alan Shearer didn't join Manchester United has been revealed |url=https://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/alan-shearer-man-united-137764 |access-date=2024-10-15 |website=SportsJOE.ie |language=en-US}}</ref> He also made at least one approach for the Sheffield Wednesday striker [[David Hirst (footballer)|David Hirst]], but manager [[Trevor Francis]] rejected all offers and the player stayed put. In the end, he paid £1&nbsp;million for 23-year-old [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] striker [[Dion Dublin]] – his only major signing of the summer.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=George |date=2024-02-20 |title=I was told I wasn't allowed to join Utd - what I did next is my biggest regret |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-transfer-ferguson-news-25402113 |access-date=2024-10-15 |website=Manchester Evening News |language=en}}</ref>

After a slow start to the [[1992–93 Manchester United F.C. season|1992–93 season]] by sitting 10th at the beginning of November, it looked as though United would miss out on the [[1992–93 FA Premier League|league]] title yet again. However, after the purchase of French striker [[Eric Cantona]] from Leeds for £1.2&nbsp;million, the future of Manchester United, and Ferguson's position as manager, began to look bright.<ref>{{Cite web |title=30 years ago: The phone calls that took Cantona to Man Utd |url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/59999 |access-date=2024-10-15 |website=www.premierleague.com |language=en}}</ref> Cantona formed a strong partnership with Mark Hughes. On 10 April 1993, United were second in the league when they faced Sheffield Wednesday at home. United were losing with four minutes to go before [[Steve Bruce]] equalised. After seven minutes of injury time – which was subsequently dubbed "Fergie Time", alluding to extra minutes allegedly being granted to Ferguson's teams to get a goal – Bruce scored the 97th-minute winner, with Ferguson [[goal celebration|celebrating the goal]] by running from his dugout on to the touch line, while assistant Brian Kidd ran on to the field.<ref name="Fergie Time">{{cite news |title=From the Vault: Manchester United, 'Fergie Time' and Steve Bruce's headers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/10/vault-steve-bruce-headers-manchester-united |access-date=15 October 2018 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Seen as being a decisive victory, it put United top of the league, where they remained. Winning the title ended United's 26-year wait for a league title, and also made them the first [[List of English football champions#Premier League (1992–present)|Premier League champions]]. United finished with a ten-point margin over runners-up [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], whose 1–0 defeat at [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] on 2 May 1993 had given United the title.

====1993–95: Double win and loss====
The [[1993–94 Manchester United F.C. season|1993–94 season]] brought more success. Ferguson added Nottingham Forest's 22-year-old midfielder [[Roy Keane]] to the ranks for a British record fee of £3.75&nbsp;million as a long term replacement for Bryan Robson, who was nearing the end of his career.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/23/roy-keane-career-highs-lows |title=The highs and lows of Roy Keane's career |date=23 April 2009 |access-date=13 July 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}</ref> United led the [[1993–94 Premier League]] table virtually from start to finish.<ref name=":8" /> Ferguson was the first winner of the [[Premier League Manager of the Month]] award, introduced for the start of the 1993–94 season, when he collected the accolade for August 1993.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ferguson's incredible stats as he enters Hall of Fame |url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/3123421 |access-date=2024-10-19 |website=www.premierleague.com |language=en}}</ref> Cantona was top scorer with 25 goals in all competitions despite being [[Foul (association football)|sent off]] twice in the space of five days in March 1994. United also reached the League Cup final but lost 3–1 to Aston Villa, managed by Ferguson's predecessor, Ron Atkinson. In the FA Cup final, Manchester United achieved an impressive 4–0 scoreline against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], winning Ferguson his second [[Double (association football)#England|League and Cup Double]], following his Scottish Premier Division and Scottish Cup titles with Aberdeen in 1984–85, though the League Cup final defeat meant that he had not yet achieved a repeat of the treble that he had achieved with Aberdeen in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Squad of Manchester United 1993-94 Premier League {{!}} BDFutbol |url=https://www.bdfutbol.com/en/t/t1993-942019.html#google_vignette |access-date=2024-10-15 |website=www.bdfutbol.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Agenda {{!}} Lowry |url=https://thelowry.com/whats-on/manchester-united-double-winners/ |access-date=2024-10-15 |website=thelowry.com}}</ref><ref name=":8">{{Cite web |date=2020-03-25 |title=Manchester United 1993/94 – Stand Out Seasons |url=https://prostinternational.com/2020/03/25/manchester-united-1993-94-stand-out-seasons/ |access-date=2024-10-15 |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Cantona assaulted a Crystal Palace supporter in a game at [[Selhurst Park]], and it seemed likely he would leave English football. An eight-month ban saw Cantona miss the final four months of the season. He also received a 14-day prison sentence for the offence but the sentence was quashed on appeal and replaced by a 120-hour community service order.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Smyth |first=Rob |date=2020-01-25 |title=Eric Cantona and 'the hooligan': the impact of the kung-fu kick 25 years on |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/25/eric-cantona-kung-fu-kick-hooligan-25-years-later |access-date=2024-10-15 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> United paid a British record fee of £7&nbsp;million for Newcastle United's prolific striker [[Andy Cole]], with young winger [[Keith Gillespie]] heading to the north-east in exchange.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The inside story of the transfer: When Newcastle sold Andy Cole to Man United{{!}} All Football |url=https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/All/The-inside-story-of-the-transfer-When-Newcastle-sold-Andy-Cole-to-Man-United/2176485 |access-date=2024-10-15 |website=AllfootballOfficial |language=en}}</ref> The season also saw the breakthrough of young players [[Gary Neville]], [[Nicky Butt]] and [[Paul Scholes]], who provided excellent cover for the long periods that United were left without some of their more experienced stars. However, the championship slipped out of Manchester United's grasp as they drew 1–1 with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on the final day of the season, when a win would have given them a third successive league title.

====1995–98====
Ferguson was heavily criticised in the summer of 1995 when three of United's star players were allowed to leave and replacements were not bought.

In December 1998, Kidd left his role as assistant to become the manager of Blackburn Rovers. Ferguson instructed [[Eric Harrison]] and [[Les Kershaw]] to find suitable replacements, "in terms of coaching ability and work ethic." Both recommended [[Steve McClaren]], the assistant to [[Jim Smith (footballer, born 1940)|Jim Smith]] at [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. McClaren was Ferguson's initial choice and appointed him in February 1999.

Ferguson felt United's bid to regain the Premier League began indifferently because of their commitments to other competitions. He was willing to "pay for the progress" made in the Champions League; the team finished second in their Champions League "group of death", behind Bayern Munich and ahead of Barcelona. United's win against Liverpool in the FA Cup fourth round was a portent for the remainder of the season.

In the final weeks of the league season, Arsenal emerged as a credible challenger to United.

United's progression in the Champions League was promising compared to previous seasons. The team eliminated Inter Milan at the quarter-final stage and faced [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] in the last four of the competition.<ref name=":9" /> A late goal scored by Giggs in the first leg earned the team a 1–1 draw, but in spite of conceding an away goal, Ferguson was adamant of United's chances of reaching the final: "...&nbsp;something tells me we are going to win.

Days after the FA Cup final, United travelled to Barcelona, the setting for the [[1999 UEFA Champions League final|UEFA Champions League final]]. Ferguson contemplated his team selection against Bayern Munich; suspensions to Scholes and Keane ruled both players out of the match.<ref name="mdf"/> Beckham was positioned in centre midfield, while Giggs moved to the right wing and Blomqvist started on the left – changes the manager felt would prevent the opposition from playing narrow.<ref name="mdf"/> United conceded in the first six minutes of the final, from a [[Mario Basler]]'s free kick.

Ferguson, interviewed moments after, said, "I can't believe it. Football, bloody hell.

Schmeichel's decision to leave United after eight seasons prompted Ferguson to bring in replacements: [[Mark Bosnich]] from Aston Villa and Italian [[Massimo Taibi]].

In the [[2000–01 Manchester United F.C. season|2000–01 season]], United retained the league title for a third season, becoming only the fourth side in history to do so.

Several players were sent away for surgery in this period, a "minor gamble" Ferguson took in the hope they would return energised.<ref name=":12" /> Defeats, such as the one to Manchester City at Maine Road in November 2002, forced United to change their playing style. The team "moved the ball forward more and quicker rather than concentrating on possession ratios", and the coaching staff tried accommodating [[Diego Forlán]] with Ruud van Nistelrooy, before settling with Paul Scholes. United's league form improved as the season went on despite defeat by Liverpool in the [[2003 Football League Cup Final]] and they overhauled Arsenal to win the Premier League for an eighth time in May 2003.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2992107.stm |title=Ten weeks that turned the title |work=BBC Sport |date=4 May 2003 |access-date=6 January 2014 |last=Fletcher |first=Paul}}</ref> The team were eliminated in the Champions League quarter-final to Real Madrid over two legs; Ferguson described the second match, a 4–3 win at Old Trafford as "epic".{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

In December 2003, Rio Ferdinand was banned from playing football for eight months after he failed to present himself at a drugs test.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3333091.stm |title=Ferdinand banned for eight months |work=BBC Sport |date=19 December 2003 |access-date=6 January 2014}}</ref> Ferguson in his autobiography ten years later blamed the drug testers, who "...didn't do their job. They didn't go looking for Rio". The absence of Ferdinand hampered United's defence of the Premier League in the [[2003–04 Manchester United F.C. season|2003–04 season]]; the team finished third behind Arsenal's "[[The Invincibles (football)|Invincibles]]" and Chelsea. In Europe, they experienced defeat at the hands of eventual winners [[FC Porto|Porto]]. Ferguson felt it was possible "not because of the performance of the players but because of the referee", who disallowed a legitimate Scholes goal that would have been enough to progress. United ended the campaign as FA Cup winners, beating [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] 3–0 in the [[2004 FA Cup final|2004 final]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/may/24/match.manchesterunited |title=United triumph by taking the job seriously |first=Kevin |last=McCarra |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=24 May 2004 |access-date=24 May 2004}}</ref>

At the beginning of the [[2004–05 Manchester United F.C. season|2004–05 season]], teenage striker [[Wayne Rooney]] (the world's most expensive teenager at more than £20&nbsp;million) and Argentine defender [[Gabriel Heinze]] joined United while Cristiano Ronaldo continued where he had left off the previous season by putting in more match-winning performances.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rice |first=Simon |date=2017 |title=Wayne Rooney: What they said when he signed for Manchester United in 2004 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news/what-they-said-when-rooney-signed-for-manchester-united-10-years-ago-9700594.html}}</ref> But the lack of a striker after Ruud van Nistelrooy spent most of the season injured saw the club finish third for the third time in four seasons. In the [[2004–05 FA Cup]], they lost on [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]] to Arsenal in the final. A second-round exit from the Champions League at the hands of Milan and a semi-final exit from the League Cup at the hands of eventual winners Chelsea (who also clinched the Premier League title) meant that 2004–05 was a rare instance of a trophyless season for United. During the season, Ferguson managed his 1,000th game in charge of United in a 2–1 home win against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/nov/23/newsstory.sport16 |title=Man Utd 2 – 1 Lyon |date=23 November 2004 |access-date=22 March 2014 |work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4032819.stm |title=Man Utd 2–1 Lyon |date=23 November 2004 |access-date=22 March 2014 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>

Ferguson's preparations for the [[2005–06 Manchester United F.C. season|2005–06 season]] were disrupted by a high-profile dispute with major shareholder [[John Magnier]], over the ownership of the racehorse [[Rock of Gibraltar (horse)|Rock of Gibraltar]]. When Magnier and business partner [[J. P. McManus]] agreed to sell their shares to American business tycoon [[Malcolm Glazer]], it cleared the way for Glazer to acquire full control of the club. This sparked violent protests from United fans,<ref>{{cite news|title=Fans rage at Glazer takeover move|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/4541093.stm|access-date=8 May 2013|publisher=BBC|date=13 May 2005}}</ref> and disrupted Ferguson's plans to strengthen the team in the transfer market. In spite of this, United looked to solve their goalkeeping and midfield problems. For this, they signed the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]] goalkeeper [[Edwin van der Sar]] from [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[South Korea national football team|Korean]] star [[Park Ji-sung]] from PSV.

The season was one of transition. On 18 November, Roy Keane officially left the club, his contract ended by mutual consent. United failed to qualify for the knock-out phase of the UEFA Champions League. In the January transfer window, Serbian defender [[Nemanja Vidić]] and French full-back [[Patrice Evra]] were signed, and the side finished in second place in the league, behind runaway winners Chelsea. Winning the League Cup was a consolation prize for lack of success elsewhere. Ruud van Nistelrooy's future at Old Trafford was in doubt after not starting in the League Cup final, and he departed at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news |last=McNulty |first=Phil |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/5223740.stm |title=Ferguson's Ruud dilemma |date=28 July 2006 |access-date=10 April 2014 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>

Before the start of the new season, Ferguson received much criticism, particular in the guise of an article in ''The Guardian'' titled "Shredding his legacy at every turn".<ref>{{cite news |last=Smyth |first=Rob |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jul/31/sport.comment |title=Shredding his legacy at every turn |date=31 July 2006 |access-date=8 August 2014 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>

====Retirement====
On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he had decided to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22447018|title=Sir Alex Ferguson to retire as Manchester United manager|work=BBC Sport |date=8 May 2013|access-date=8 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11667/8698530/Sir-Alex-Ferguson-to-retire-this-summer-Manchester-United-confirm|title=Sir Alex Ferguson to retire this summer, Manchester United confirm|publisher=Sky Sports|date=8 May 2013|access-date=8 May 2013}}</ref> ''The Guardian'' announced it was the "end of an era",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/08/alex-ferguson-manchester-united|work=The Guardian|title=End of an era as Alex Ferguson calls time at Manchester United|first=Barney|last=Ronay|date=8 May 2013|access-date=8 May 2013}}</ref> while [[UEFA]] president [[Michel Platini]] referred to Ferguson as "a true visionary".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/platini-ferguson-true-visionary-120600808--sow.html|publisher=Yahoo!|title=Platini: Ferguson a true visionary|first=Stefan|last=Coerts|access-date=8 May 2013|archive-date=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807040157/http://sports.yahoo.com/news/platini-ferguson-true-visionary-120600808--sow.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Former Manchester United players Paul Ince and Bryan Robson agreed that Ferguson would be "a hard act to follow".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/sportvideo/footballvideo/10044569/Sir-Alex-Ferguson-resigns-Football-greats-pay-tribute.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509021624/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/sportvideo/footballvideo/10044569/Sir-Alex-Ferguson-resigns-Football-greats-pay-tribute.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 May 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=8 May 2013|date=8 May 2013|title=Sir Alex Ferguson resigns: Football greats pay tribute}}</ref> Manchester United co-chairman [[Joel Glazer]] said, "His determination to succeed and dedication to the club have been truly remarkable."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/sports/sir-alex-ferguson-to-retire|work = Fox Sports|access-date=8 May 2013|date=8 May 2013 |title=Sir Alex Ferguson to retire}}</ref> Ferguson revealed that he had in fact decided that he was going to retire back in December 2012 and that it had been very difficult not to reveal his plans.<ref>{{cite news |title=Man United boss Sir Alex Ferguson's Old Trafford farewell |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22485088 |url-status=dead |work=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2013 |access-date=13 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614010735/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22485088 |archive-date=14 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Ferguson's announcement of his decision to retire saw United's shares fall 5% on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Sir Alex Ferguson retires: Man Utd shares fall in New York |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22455508 |work=BBC News |date=8 May 2013 |access-date=8 May 2013}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===Gordon Strachan===
[[Gordon Strachan]] was a key player for Ferguson at Aberdeen, but their relationship broke down when Strachan signed an agreement with German club [[1. FC Köln|FC Köln]] without telling Ferguson.<ref name="Fergie v Strachan"/> Ferguson said that he believed although "there was a cunning streak in Strachan, I had never imagined that he could pull such a stroke on me".<ref name="Fergie v Strachan"/> Strachan did not sign for Köln, but instead moved to Manchester United in the summer of 1984.<ref name="Fergie v Strachan"/> Strachan liked the move because he felt that Ron Atkinson treated him as an adult, unlike Ferguson.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/5228964.stm |title=Strachan keen to end Fergie rift |work=BBC Sport |date=30 July 2006 |access-date=18 October 2015}}</ref> Strachan was still with the club when Ferguson was appointed manager in November 1986.<ref name="Fergie v Strachan"/> Ferguson thought that Strachan did not play for United with the same confidence he had in Scotland and subsequently sold him to Leeds United in 1989.<ref name="Fergie v Strachan"/> Strachan enjoyed significant success with Leeds as a veteran player, helping them win the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92]] English league championship in a title race with Ferguson's United.<ref name="Fergie v Strachan"/>

Their relationship continued to be frosty as Strachan moved into management himself.<ref name="Fergie v Strachan"/> In his 1999 autobiography, Ferguson stated that Strachan "could not be trusted an inch – I would not want to expose my back to him in a hurry".<ref name="Fergie v Strachan">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/5335578.stm|title=Fergie v Strachan|work=BBC Sport |date=12 September 2006|access-date=18 October 2015|first=Simon|last=Austin}}</ref> Strachan's reaction to the attack, in his own autobiography, ''My Life in Football'', was one of being "surprised and disappointed", although he suspected that Ferguson had helped to relegate Strachan's [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in 2001 by fielding a weakened Manchester United team in a match against Derby County.<ref name="Fergie v Strachan"/> By 2006 they appeared to have "declared something of a truce",<ref name="Fergie v Strachan"/> ahead of Champions League matches between United and Strachan's Celtic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/2389068/strachan-no-fergie-feud |title=Strachan: No Fergie feud |first=Simon |last=Fudge |access-date=18 October 2015 |work=Sky Sports |publisher=BSkyB}}</ref>

===David Beckham===
In February 2003, Ferguson was involved in a dressing room argument with Manchester United player [[David Beckham]].<ref name="factfilemmedia" /> Ferguson allegedly kicked a football boot in frustration, which hit Beckham in the face and caused a minor injury.<ref name = "boot">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/sep/01/newsstory.sport3 |title=Beckham went for boss in boot brawl |work=The Guardian |first=Dominic |last=Fifield |date=1 September 2003 |access-date=1 March 2019}}</ref> Ferguson apologised to Beckham, who was transferred to [[Real Madrid]] later that year.<ref name = "boot"/>

===Champions League draw fixing===

===Rock of Gibraltar===
In 2003, Ferguson launched legal action against the then major Manchester United shareholder [[John Magnier]] over stud rights for race horse [[Rock of Gibraltar (horse)|Rock of Gibraltar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingandsports.com.au/breeding/rsNewsArt.asp?NID=30626|title=Sir Alex Ferguson takes His case to Court|publisher=Racing and Sports|date=20 November 2003|access-date=14 December 2009|archive-date=23 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823073417/http://www.racingandsports.com.au/breeding/rsNewsArt.asp?NID=30626|url-status=dead}}</ref> Magnier counter-sued Ferguson<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/magniers-legal-action-damages-hopes-of-a-deal-568624.html|title=Magnier's legal action damages hopes of a deal|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=3 February 2004|access-date=14 December 2009|first=Nick|last=Harris| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100122120947/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/magniers-legal-action-damages-hopes-of-a-deal-568624.html| archive-date= 22 January 2010 | url-status= dead}}</ref> by filing a "Motion to Comply" requiring Ferguson to substantiate his claim for half of Rock of Gibraltar's stud fees.

===BBC===
Ferguson refused to give interviews to the [[BBC]] after a documentary called ''Fergie and Son'' was shown on [[BBC Three]] on 27 May 2004.<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC THREE investigation raises new questions for Manchester United |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/05_may/25/fergie_son.shtml |publisher=BBC Press office |date=25 May 2004 |access-date=8 December 2013}}</ref> According to an article in ''[[The Independent]]'', the documentary had "portrayed his agent son, Jason, as somebody who exploited his father's influence and position to his own ends in the transfer market". The same newspaper article made it clear that Jason was never found guilty of any wrongdoing, and it quoted Alex Ferguson as saying: {{blockquote|They [the BBC] did a story about my son that was whole lot of nonsense.

===Referees===

Ferguson has received numerous punishments for abusing and publicly criticising match officials when he has perceived them to be at fault:

===="Fergie Time"====
It has also been suggested that Ferguson's intimidation of referees resulted in so-called "Fergie Time": that is, unusually generous [[Association football#Duration and tie-breaking methods|injury time]] being added in matches where Manchester United were behind.
