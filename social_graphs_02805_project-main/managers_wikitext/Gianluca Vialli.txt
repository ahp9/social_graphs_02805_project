'''Gianluca Vialli''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|OMRI]]}} ({{IPA|it|dʒanˈluːka ˈvjalli}}; 9 July 1964 – 5 January 2023) was an Italian [[Association football|football]] player and [[Manager (association football)|manager]] who played as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]].

In England, he won the [[1997 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]], [[1998 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]], [[1998 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|UEFA Cup Winners Cup]] and [[1998 UEFA Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup]]. He is one of nine footballers to have won the three main European club competitions and the only forward to have done so; he is also the only player in European footballing history to hold both winners and runners-up medals in all three mainstream [[UEFA]] club competitions, including two winners medals for the now-defunct [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]].

Vialli then took up an offer to manage [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club Watford in 2001–02.

==International career==
Vialli was a member of Italy's under-21 team for both the [[1984 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|1984]] and [[1986 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]]s where the Azzurrini finished third and second respectively.

In 1985, Vialli made his debut for the Italy senior team in a friendly match against [[Poland national football team|Poland]].

Vialli scored his first goal for Italy in a UEFA Euro 1988 [[UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying|qualifier]] against [[Malta national football team|Malta]] in 1986. He was included in Italy's squad for the finals of the Euro 1988 competition and scored the winning goal against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the group stage. Although Italy were knocked out by [[Soviet Union national football team|the Soviet Union]] in the semi-final after losing 0–2, Vialli was named in [[UEFA]]'s [[UEFA European Football Championship Teams of the Tournament#1988 West Germany|team of the tournament]].<ref name="1988 team of the tournament">{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/euro2024/news/0253-0d7d771ae77b-33dd16358404-1000--euro-1988-team-of-the-tournament/|title=1988 team of the tournament|publisher=UEFA|date=19 September 2011|access-date=5 June 2015}}</ref>

==Style of play==
Considered one of the best and most consistent Italian strikers of his generation, Vialli was a complete, dynamic, determined, and versatile [[Forward (association football)|forward]], who was capable of playing anywhere along the front line; throughout his career, he was played on the [[Winger (association football)|wing]], or in a deeper, [[Second striker|supporting role]], although his preferred position was in the [[Centre-forward|centre]] as a main striker, where he could best take advantage of his offensive movement and opportunism inside the box, as well as his keen eye for goal.<ref name="Fratelli d'Italia">{{cite news|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1987/09/12/fratelli-italia.html|title=Fratelli d'Italia|work=La Repubblica|language=it|date=12 September 1987|access-date=2 March 2017}}</ref><ref name="I PUPILLI DI VUJADIN">{{cite news|url=http://archivio.lastampa.it/m/articolo?id=d75936073cc4f9918b68be97710c64bb79d00b1c|title=I PUPILLI DI VUJADIN DOMANI AVVERSARI ALL'OLIMPICO IN LAZIO-CHELSEA|work=La Stampa|pages=28|language=it|author1=LAURENZI GIANCARLO|date=6 December 1999|access-date=2 March 2017|archive-date=3 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803010803/http://archivio.lastampa.it/m/articolo?id=d75936073cc4f9918b68be97710c64bb79d00b1c|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calciomercato.com/news/50-anni-10-stelle-la-classifica-di-marino-rivera-e-scirea-davant-744510|title=50 ANNI, 10 STELLE: la classifica di Marino, Rivera e Scirea davanti a Baggio|publisher=Calciomercato.com|language=it|author1=Pierpaolo Marino|date=26 March 2016|access-date=6 March 2017}}</ref> A prolific goalscorer, Vialli was known for his shooting power and accuracy with both feet as well as his head, which allowed him to finish off chances both inside and outside the penalty area.<ref name=tuttojuve/>

In 2006, Vialli released ''The Italian Job: A Journey to the Heart of Two Great Footballing Cultures'', co-written with his close friend and football journalist, [[Gabriele Marcotti]]. Written over a period of two and a half years from November 2003 until early 2006, the book discusses the differences between English and Italian football. He also attributes his tendency to play as a wide attacker to playing on a field that was short and wide as a young boy.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Gianluca Vialli|title=Gianluca Vialli: Only a game for English kids|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/2327497/Gianluca-Vialli-Only-a-game-for-English-kids.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/2327497/Gianluca-Vialli-Only-a-game-for-English-kids.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=22 May 2015|date=4 December 2007}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Vialli donated the proceeds of the book to the "Fondazione Vialli e Mauro per la ricerca e lo sport", which is a charitable foundation he founded together with former player [[Massimo Mauro]] to raise funds for research into cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ([[ALS]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionevialliemauro.org/en/about-us/|title=FONDAZIONE VIALLI E MAURO PER LA RICERCA E LO SPORT ONLUS|website=www.fondazionevialliemauro.org|access-date=22 May 2015}}</ref>

From the late 2000s Vialli worked as a TV football commentator for Sky Italia.<ref name="Il calcio è femmina: fedele in Inghilterra, vanitosa da noi"/> In 2007, he was linked with a move to the manager's position at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], following the club takeover by [[Flavio Briatore]] and [[Bernie Ecclestone]] and the dismissal of [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]] as manager, but ultimately declined any interest in the job.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://football.uk.reuters.com/uk/news/5F93CE56-7116-11DC-855C-53921312EA23.php |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070621082048/http://football.uk.reuters.com/uk/news/5F93CE56-7116-11DC-855C-53921312EA23.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 June 2007 |title=Vialli distances himself from QPR job |work=[[Reuters]] |date=2 October 2007 |access-date=10 September 2013 }}</ref> During [[UEFA Euro 2012]], he appeared as a pundit for the [[BBC]]'s coverage of the tournament.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/euro-2012-tv-review-bbc-1108989 |title=Euro 2012 TV review: BBC in need of an overhaul after tournament to forget |work=Daily Mirror |last=Shelley |first=Jim |date=1 July 2012 |access-date=21 May 2015 }}</ref>
