'''Christopher William Gerard Hughton''' (born 11 December 1958) is a professional [[Association football|football]] manager and former player. Born in England, he represented the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]]. He was most recently head coach of the [[Ghana national football team|Ghana national team]].

After making his professional debut aged 20, Hughton spent most of his playing career with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left-back]], leaving in 1990 after 13 years. After relatively brief spells with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]], he retired from playing in 1993 at the age of 34. He earned 53 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] representing the Republic of Ireland, scoring one goal and starting in all three of Ireland's games at [[UEFA Euro 1988]] in [[West Germany]].

From 1993 to 2007, Hughton served as coach and then assistant manager for Tottenham. He joined [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] as first team coach in 2008, and, following their relegation, became [[caretaker manager]]. He led Newcastle back to the [[Premier League]] in his first season in charge, along the way breaking a number of records and securing the permanent managerial position. He was dismissed as manager by [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]] the following December, with his side 12th in the table. Hughton managed [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] for a single season, leading them to fourth place in the league, before joining [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in June 2012. Norwich dismissed him in April 2014 following a run of poor results.

Following his departure from Norwich, Hughton became manager of [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] in December 2014. Three years later in 2017, he led the club to promotion to the Premier League for the first time in its history. He avoided relegation for two successive seasons before being dismissed in May 2019 due to a run of poor form. Hughton was appointed as manager of [[Nottingham Forest]] in October 2020, before being dismissed in September 2021 after a poor start to the season. He acted as technical advisor to the [[Ghana national football team|Ghana national team]] for the period of their [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – CAF third round|World Cup qualifiers]] in March 2022.

In February 2023, he was promoted to the position of head coach of Ghana following the resignation of [[Otto Addo]] after the failure of the Black Stars team at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. However, following Ghana's group-stage exit at the [[2023 Africa Cup of Nations]], Hughton was relieved of his duties as head coach.

=== Newcastle United ===

==== Caretaker spell ====
During the off-season of 2009, owner [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]] announced he was selling the club, and Hughton was again left with the job of caretaker manager when the club failed to further secure the services of [[Alan Shearer]]. This was followed by a statement from Llambias: "[[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]] feels it would be unwise to appoint a team manager when the club is for sale," leaving Hughton in charge for the start of the [[2009–10 Newcastle United F.C. season|2009–10 season]]. Hughton's first two games in charge of the new season saw inspired performances in a 1–1 draw with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] away from home and a memorable 3–0 win against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] at home, which ended in [[Shola Ameobi]] getting his first ever hat trick. He continued Newcastle's unbeaten start of the new season with a 1–0 victory over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] which also featured his first transfer signing of the season [[Danny Simpson]]. Hughton also signed [[Peter Løvenkrands]] and [[Fabrice Pancrate]] on free transfers and completed the loan signings of [[Zurab Khizanishvili]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_5565231,00.html |title= Magpies land Khizanishvili |publisher=Sky Sports |date= 17 September 2009|access-date=10 December 2010 }}</ref> and [[Marlon Harewood]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Marlon Harewood completes loan move to Newcastle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/25/marlon-harewood-newcastle-aston-villa-football|access-date=7 June 2012|newspaper=www.guardian.co.uk|date=25 September 2009|location=London}}</ref>

==== Permanent role ====
[[Image:Chris Hughton v Ipswich.jpg|thumb|upright|Hughton managing Newcastle United in 2010]]
A positive start to the 2009–10 season saw Hughton win successive Manager of the Month awards for August and September and then again in November, resulting in the board naming him as the new permanent manager of the club, after two stints as caretaker.<ref>{{ cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/28/newcastle-mike-ashley-chris-hughton|title=Mike Ashley takes Newcastle off market as Chris Hughton is appointed manager|date=28 October 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Callow, James|author2=Taylor, Louise|access-date=6 April 2010|location=London}}</ref> Hughton's league start to his managerial career was the best in Newcastle's history. In January, Newcastle signed [[Mike Williamson (footballer)|Mike Williamson]], [[Wayne Routledge]] and [[Leon Best]] in permanent transfers and [[Fitz Hall]] and [[Patrick van Aanholt]] on loan. On 5 April 2010, Newcastle, under Hughton's control, confirmed their promotion back to the [[Premier League]] prior to a match against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], after [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] failed to win their match against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. They then went on to win the game 2–1 with a Peter Løvenkrands penalty and a [[bicycle kick]]-goal from [[Kevin Nolan]] to earn them a place back in the Premier League after just one season away.<ref>{{ cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/championship/newcastleunited/7556968/Newcastle-United-2-Sheffield-United-1-match-report.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406204223/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/championship/newcastleunited/7556968/Newcastle-United-2-Sheffield-United-1-match-report.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 April 2010|title=Newcastle United 2 Sheffield United 1: match report|date=6 April 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Rob|last=Stewart|access-date=6 April 2010|location=London}}</ref> Newcastle then went on to clinch the Championship title on 19 April 2010 after a 2–0 victory over [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], winning 30, drawing 12 and losing just 4 of their 46 matches. Newcastle were unbeaten at home for the entire 2009–10 season including both cup competitions, clinching promotion in record time.

During pre-season for the [[2010–11 Newcastle United F.C. season|2010–11 season]], Hughton signed [[Sol Campbell]] and [[Dan Gosling]] for free whilst getting [[James Perch]] for an undisclosed fee. His first home win on return to the Premier League came on 22 August, when Newcastle thrashed [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] 6–0, with three goals from [[Andy Carroll]], two goals from [[Kevin Nolan]] and one from [[Joey Barton]].<ref>{{ cite news|url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~2131092,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825083120/http://www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0%2C%2C12306~2131092%2C00.html |archive-date=25 August 2010 |title=Newcastle United 6–0 Aston Villa:match report |date=22 August 2010 |work=Premier League News |access-date=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Hughton received praise for his calm management style to stabilise the club, shrewd signings and guiding Newcastle back to the Premier League.

Following a 3–1 defeat at West Brom in December, Hughton became the first Premier League manager of the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11]] season to lose his job, as he was dismissed by managing director Derek Llambias. The decision was badly received by the players and the supporters, with veteran defender Sol Campbell claiming that the decision "makes no sense", and local commentator and ex-player [[John Anderson (Irish footballer)|John Anderson]] saying he was "devastated and angry".<ref>{{ cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/9261212.stm|title=Boss Chris Hughton sacked by Newcastle United|date=6 December 2010|work=BBC Sport|access-date=6 December 2010 }}</ref> The dismissal was also condemned by Lord [[Alan Sugar]],<ref>{{ cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/9266194.stm|title=Chris Hughton not treated 'decently' by Mike Ashley – Lord Alan Sugar|date=7 December 2010|work=BBC Sport|access-date=7 December 2010 }}</ref> [[Colin Calderwood]]<ref>{{ cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/9262152.stm|title=Colin Calderwood shocked by Chris Hughton sacking|date=6 December 2010|work=BBC Sport|access-date=7 December 2010 }}</ref> and Alan Shearer.<ref>{{ cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/9266069.stm|title=Alan Shearer dismayed at Newcastle firing Chris Hughton|date=7 December 2010|work=BBC Sport|access-date=7 December 2010 }}</ref> The club stated that "an individual with more managerial experience [was] needed to take the club forward".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20101206/united-part-company-with-hughton_2281670_2237950|title=United Part Company With Hughton|work=nufc.co.uk|access-date=6 December 2010 }}</ref> Peter Fraser of [[Sky Sports]] said that Hughton "brought calmness, dignity and respect to the Magpies' dugout",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11979_6557504,00.html|title=Paying the price|last=Fraser|first=Peter|date=6 December 2010|work=SkySports|access-date=6 December 2010 }}</ref> while the [[BBC]]'s Phil McNulty's opinion was that "Newcastle's followers have been loyal and grateful to Hughton" and that "Ashley will no doubt face further accusations that he is out of touch with football's realities".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philmcnulty/2010/12/hughton_sacking_shames_newcast.html|title=Hughton sacking shames Newcastle|last=McNulty|first=Phil|date=6 December 2010|work=BBC Sport|access-date=6 December 2010 }}</ref> Before the match against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 11 December, campaigners from [[United For Newcastle]] organised a protest outside [[St James' Park]] as an opportunity for supporters to thank Hughton and to show their anger towards Ashley's decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/UtdForNewcastle|title=United For Newcastle organise protest for Hughton}}</ref>

===Norwich City===
At the end of the [[2011–12 Birmingham City F.C. season|2011–12 season]], Birmingham gave [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] permission to talk to Hughton about their vacant managerial post, and he signed for ''the Canaries'' on 7 June 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18356657 |title=Chris Hughton appointed as new Norwich City manager |work=BBC Sport |date=7 June 2012}}</ref> His first league game in charge was against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], where Norwich lost 5–0,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19221586 |title=Fulham 5-0 Norwich |work=BBC Sport |date=18 August 2012}}</ref> although this result was followed by memorable league victories against both Arsenal<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19939648 |title=Norwich 1-0 Arsenal|work=BBC Sport |date=20 October 2012}}</ref> and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20278530 |title=Norwich 1-0 Manchester United |work=BBC Sport |date=17 November 2012}}</ref> as well as a [[2012–13 Football League Cup|League Cup]] victory against Tottenham Hotspur.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20053702 |title=Norwich 2-1 Tottenham |work=BBC Sport |date=31 October 2012}}</ref> Norwich, however, experienced bad form throughout the winter and towards the end of the season.

Norwich experienced a turbulent period throughout the [[2013–14 Norwich City F.C. season|2013–14 season]] with the club winning only 10 games, with eight of those victories coming in league and two in the [[2013–14 Football League Cup|Football League Cup]] as at March 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Clarke |first=Patrick |date=6 April 2014 |title=Chris Hughton Fired as Manager of Norwich City |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2019475-chris-hughton-fired-as-manager-of-norwich-city |access-date=14 February 2023 |website=Bleacher Report |language=}}</ref> On 6 April 2014, Norwich announced they had "parted company" with Hughton with immediate effect.

By April 2017 with three games left to go, Hughton had guided Brighton to the top of the [[2016–17 EFL Championship]] earning the club automatic promotion to the [[Premier League]] after a 2–1 win at home to Wigan.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39549523|work=BBC Sport|title=Brighton & Hove Albion 2-1 Wigan Athletic|last=Smee|first=Gary|date=17 April 2017|access-date=13 May 2019}}</ref> Brighton and Hughton lost their next two games to Norwich City and Bristol City. The final game of that campaign saw Brighton draw away at Aston Villa 1–1 which allowed Newcastle United to jump above them by one point and missing out on crowning the club champions of the Championship.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39760417 |title=Aston Villa 1 – 1 Brighton & Hove Albion |work=BBC Sport |date=7 May 2017 |access-date=13 May 2019}}</ref>

On 9 March 2018, Hughton won [[Premier League Manager of the Month]] award for February and became the first black manager to win the prize.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chris Hughton is Premier League's first black manager of the month |url=https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/chris-hughton-is-premier-leagues-first-black-manager-of-the-month-pkrlldwk2 |access-date=2 September 2020 |work=[[The Times]] |date=10 March 2018}}</ref> He guided Brighton to 15th place in their first season in the Premier League, securing their status in the division with a 1–0 home victory against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43916611|title=Brighton & Hove Albion 1–0 Manchester United|work=BBC Sport|date=4 May 2018|access-date=13 May 2019}}</ref>

On 13 May 2019, despite leading the club to safety again with a 17th place finish, Hughton was sacked by Brighton following a run of only three wins in 23 games in the Premier League, leaving the club and only two points clear of relegation at the end of the 2018–19 season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.goal.com/en-in/news/brighton-sack-hughton-after-narrow-escape-from-premier/1xd3d10os3he21c9pws2xm0q0l|title=Chris Hughton sacked|work=Goal.com|access-date=13 May 2019}}</ref>

On 6 October 2020, Hughton was appointed manager of [[EFL Championship]] club [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], following [[Sabri Lamouchi]]'s dismissal earlier in the day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/06/nottingham-forest-sack-sabri-lamouchi-as-manager-after-terrible-start-to-season|title=Nottingham Forest hire Chris Hughton following sacking of Sabri Lamouchi|website=The Guardian|date=6 October 2020|access-date=6 October 2020}}</ref> Hughton's first game as Forest manager was a 1–0 win away at [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 17 October 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Blackburn Rovers vs Nottingham Forest on 17 Oct 20 - Match Centre - Nottingham Forest|url=https://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/matches/fixtures/first-team/202021/october/blackburn-rovers-vs-nottingham-forest-on-17-oct-20/#report|access-date=2020-10-17|website=www.nottinghamforest.co.uk}}</ref> After taking over a Forest side that were bottom of the Championship table with zero points, Hughton guided Forest to a 17th place position in his first season in charge, finishing nine points above the relegation zone.

Ahead of the [[2021–22 Nottingham Forest F.C. season|new season]], Hughton was faced with the task of rebuilding his Forest side into a team capable of challenging for promotion.
