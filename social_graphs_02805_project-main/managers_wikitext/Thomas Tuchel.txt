Tuchel became head coach at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2021 and [[2021 UEFA Champions League final|won the Champions League]] in his debut season, being named [[The Best FIFA Football Coach]].

==Playing career==
Born in [[Krumbach, Bavaria]], Tuchel starred as a member of his local club, TSV Krumbach, coached by his father, Rudolf.<ref name="BBC Sport">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/57272646|title=Thomas Tuchel's career path: From Krumbach to the Champions League final|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=28 May 2021|archive-date=2 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602213919/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/57272646|url-status=live}}</ref> Tuchel moved to the [[FC Augsburg]] academy in 1988, however, he never appeared for the first team, being released at age 19.

Tuchel played eight games during the 1992–93 season.

The composition of the squad was seen in Tuchel's tactical approach at Mainz, as despite possessing technically inferior players, he instructed them to utilise long distribution and focus on pressing off the ball, typically overloading one portion of the opposition half in order to create less space to generate counter-attacking opportunities, as relentless high-pressure would create chances by dispossessing or forcing errors from the opposition.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=Tactics Explained {{!}} Why Everton Should've Hired Thomas Tuchel| date=9 November 2017 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El6fafnwCRI|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210515101036/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El6fafnwCRI|archive-date=15 May 2021|access-date=4 November 2018|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> An initial disciplinarian, Tuchel reportedly forbade his players to leave the canteen while others were still eating, deeming it ill-mannered.<ref name="McCambridge">{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/thomas-tuchel-the-rise-and-rage-of-the-chelsea-manager-by-those-who-know-him|title=Thomas Tuchel: the rise and rage of Pep Guardiola's conqueror – by those who know the Chelsea manager|first=Ed|last=McCambridge|publisher=FourFourTwo|date=24 September 2021|access-date=13 May 2022|archive-date=30 May 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220530230633/https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/thomas-tuchel-the-rise-and-rage-of-the-chelsea-manager-by-those-who-know-him|url-status=live}}</ref> Tuchel's tactics based on pressing and positional play led Mainz to a ninth-placed finish in [[2009–10 Bundesliga|his first season as manager]].<ref name="2009–10 league table">{{cite web|title=1.

Tuchel is known for his implementation of innovative training methods.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Honigstein|first=Raphael|date=7 April 2016|title=Thomas Tuchel: the brilliance of Klopp's shape-shifting successor at Dortmund|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/07/thomas-tuchel-borussia-dortmund-jurgen-klopp|access-date=9 January 2022|website=[[The Guardian]]|archive-date=16 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210116134218/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/07/thomas-tuchel-borussia-dortmund-jurgen-klopp|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://footballbh.net/2019/02/14/champions-league-manchester-united-psg-tactical-analysis-statistics/|title=How Thomas Tuchel out-smarted Solskjaer's Manchester United|date=14 February 2019|website=Football Bloody Hell|access-date=6 January 2021|archive-date=2 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210202013117/https://footballbh.net/2019/02/14/champions-league-manchester-united-psg-tactical-analysis-statistics/|url-status=live |last1=Sinuraya |first1=Petrick }}</ref> During his tenures at Mainz and Dortmund, Tuchel made players take touches with their knees, cut the corners off the training pitch in an effort to force accurate passing and movement, and obliged his players to hold tennis balls during defensive drills to keep unnecessary fouling in check.<ref name="auto"/> Training was reportedly made so difficult and mentally exhausting that actual games felt easy in comparison.<ref name="The Athletic"/>

A stringent analyst, Tuchel once paused a documentary on [[Pep Guardiola]] for two hours on the Mainz bus to study a graph which showed Barcelona's passing patterns.<ref name="Johnson">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/2621058/2021/05/29/thomas-tuchel-the-innovator-who-took-chelsea-to-champions-league-glory/|title=Thomas Tuchel, the innovator who took Chelsea to Champions League glory|first=Simon|last=Johnson|date=29 May 2021|website=The Athletic|access-date=14 May 2022|archive-date=13 May 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220513235449/https://theathletic.com/2621058/2021/05/29/thomas-tuchel-the-innovator-who-took-chelsea-to-champions-league-glory/|url-status=live}}</ref> Tuchel has borrowed training methods from other sports, including archery and kick-boxing; he once made his Mainz team spend close to a month training with a handball club. According to [[Jan Kirchhoff]], Tuchel also emphasised psychological training, regularly sharing extracts from newspaper articles or books with his players to challenge their thinking.<ref name="Johnson"/> An initial disciplinarian, Tuchel implemented bans on eating refined carbohydrates, replacing it with wholemeal pasta and light sauces at his clubs. He changed this approach after being appointed at PSG.<ref name="Johnson"/>

Sources close to Chelsea noted Tuchel's training sessions at the club featured a light tone, with a wide range of drills including smaller footballs or using hands instead of feet in some games.<ref>{{cite web|last=Magowan|first=Alistair|date=16 March 2021|title=Thomas Tuchel: Can Chelsea boss find goals after restoring Blues harmony?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56410225|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210317073632/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56410225|archive-date=17 March 2021|access-date=17 March 2021|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> He also used staggered recovery, such as lighter sessions after big games or rest days altogether. According to [[Andreas Christensen]], in days leading up to games, training intensity typically increased, with focus on possession over tactical discussion, such as practising three v two passing drills.<ref name="Johnson"/> As England manager, Tuchel was criticised by some media figures for not attending more [[Premier League]] matches when considering player selection, prompting Tuchel to defend his methods, saying, "I watch five matches on a wide-angle screen.

===Tactics===
Labelled a "tactical chameleon", Tuchel's tactical knowledge and flexibility has seen wide praise.

Writing for ''[[The Athletic]]'', Liam Twomey and Sebastian Stafford-Bloor said Tuchel's Mainz side prioritised adaptability in their approach, changing formation or tactical set-up multiple times each game to negate the particular strengths of their opponent. Speaking on this, Tuchel remarked, "We broke all [established] tactical rules [and assumptions] not for the sake of it, but because we were inferior in all aspects [at Mainz] and were forced to".<ref name="The Athletic"/> During his time at Dortmund, Tuchel often used the 4–1–4–1 and 4–2–3–1 formations; with the former, he made his team force overloads in space out wide, while with the latter, he looked to create overloads in pockets of space in between the lines of the opposition.<ref name=":0" /> He also made the club more ball-dominant, as average possession by the team increased almost 9% following his appointment.<ref name="Thomas Tuchel's coaching playbook"/>

At Paris Saint-Germain, Tuchel primarily played a [[Formation (association football)|4–3–3]] with plenty of flair to emphasise the attacking capabilities of wide forwards Neymar and Mbappé (although he used up to ten different formations while at the club).<ref name="auto2"/> During the 2018–19 season, the forward line, with Neymar and Mbappé flanking central target man Cavani, regularly dropped into the half-space or into wide areas.<ref name="Tifo Football">{{cite web|date=10 February 2019|title=Tuchel's PSG Are More Than Just Big-Name Players|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_VO6yH43_Q|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108193656/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_VO6yH43_Q|archive-date=8 November 2020|access-date=2 September 2020|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Tifo Football}}</ref> The team's full-backs would also push up alongside the midfield in order to attain positional overloads, and players were encouraged to find space between the lines of defence and midfield to disorganise the opposition.<ref>{{cite web|date=9 March 2021|title=Tactics Explained: Pochettino's PSG|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elaTzZT3QyY|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210314051732/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elaTzZT3QyY|archive-date=14 March 2021|access-date=10 March 2021|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Tifo Football}}</ref> Simultaneously, this would disrupt attempts to man-mark Neymar and Mbappé and create open space behind the defensive line for the pair to run into.<ref name="Tifo Football"/>{{Self-published inline|date=November 2025}}

Writing for ''The Athletic'',  Thom Harris and Mark Carey stated Tuchel's ideas hinge on controlling possession in midfield and overloading the centre of the pitch with technical players who can both retain the ball and press quickly when it is lost.<ref name="Thomas Tuchel's coaching playbook"/> For example, at PSG, the team's midfield would see the deepest defensive midfielder stick close to the central defenders, who would often be joined by another midfielder acting as a deep-lying [[playmaker]]. These roles were occupied by Marquinhos and [[Marco Verratti]], respectively. The last remaining midfielder would push forward to stagger attacks and disrupt defensive structure by overloading one side of the opponent's defensive area, setting an overload passing trap.<ref name="Tifo Football"/> During the 2018–19 and 2019–20 seasons, Di María and Paredes were commonly associated with this role. The team also heavily used ''[[Gegenpressing]]'',<ref>{{cite web|date=15 October 2015|title=Jurgen Klopp's tactics: What Dortmund tells us about Liverpool|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/15117/10027207/jurgen-klopp8217s-tactics-what-dortmund-tells-us-about-liverpool|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227234740/https://www.skysports.com/football/news/15117/10027207/jurgen-klopp8217s-tactics-what-dortmund-tells-us-about-liverpool|archive-date=27 December 2018|access-date=27 December 2018|website=Sky Sports}}</ref> a tactic where, after losing possession of the ball, the team would immediately attempt to win it back rather than regroup. PSG would thus corral the opponent to one side before switching play quickly to exploit the weaker side.<ref name="Tifo Football"/> Tuchel has also been noted for using [[Marking (association football)#Man-to-man marking|man-marking]], tasking Herrera to do so on [[Thiago Alcântara|Thiago]] in the 2020 Champions League final.<ref>{{cite web|date=21 August 2020|title=Bayern Munich vs PSG: Tactical Preview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od8RrEdUt-I|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200822130200/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od8RrEdUt-I|archive-date=22 August 2020|access-date=21 August 2020|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Tifo Football}}</ref>

In the 2018–19 season, following injuries to Neymar, Verratti, and Rabiot, Tuchel sometimes successfully departed from the 4–3–3. In a 4–1 home win against Rennes in January 2019,<ref>{{cite web|date=27 January 2019|title=Unbeaten PSG stroll to win over Rennes|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46926944|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210207100257/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46926944|archive-date=7 February 2021|access-date=2 September 2020|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> PSG lined up in a [[Formation (association football)#4–2–2–2 (magic rectangle)|4–2–2–2]] formation; in possession, one defensive midfielder would drop between the central defenders to create a back three while the fullbacks pushed forward.<ref name="Tifo Football"/> This meant the other midfielder would act as a [[Defender (association football)#Sweeper (libero)|sweeping]] defensive presence while the four forwards would stay high and wide, dropping in sporadically to create vertical passing options to break the defensive line. In defence, PSG would retreat to a [[Formation (association football)#5–3–2|5–3–2]] formation and readjust to a [[Formation (association football)#4–4–2|4–4–2]] to ''gegenpress''.<ref name="Tifo Football"/>

At Chelsea, Tuchel was known for making frequent player alterations in his early tenure; he made 39 changes to the starting lineup in 10 Premier League games between January and March 2021. He mostly preferred a [[Formation (association football)#3–4–1–2|3–4–2–1]] with ball progression and width largely coming from the wingbacks, a position mainly played by [[Reece James (footballer, born 1999)|Reece James]] and [[Ben Chilwell]],<ref name="Thomas Tuchel's coaching playbook"/> while also restoring the ostracised [[Antonio Rüdiger]] to a first-team regular, deploying him as a left centre-back in a back three, despite Rüdiger being right-footed: the width provided by the wing-backs enables the rest of the attack to stay narrow ahead of two deeper midfield players to press or counterpress, relying on athletic central defenders (like Rüdiger) to cover any breakdowns.<ref name="Thomas Tuchel's coaching playbook"/> This approach made Chelsea the third-highest scorers from high regains – after Liverpool and Brighton – in the 2021–22 season.<ref name="Thomas Tuchel's coaching playbook"/> The team's general play with the ball was slower and emphasised calm possession in the opposition half to prevent counterattacks: in the same season, only Manchester City conceded fewer goals, shots on target and non-penalty expected goals.<ref name="Thomas Tuchel's coaching playbook"/>

At Bayern Munich, Tuchel reversed this approach: he used a 4-2-3-1 with his full-backs deeper instead of upfield to provide an option in wide areas; Bayern progressed the ball out wide through their wingers. He used an advancing double pivot of [[Joshua Kimmich]] and [[Leon Goretzka]] to overload opposition spaces when building up to enable progression through the pitch thirds.<ref name="Thomas Tuchel's coaching playbook"/> The central defenders would regularly stretch wide to allow a pivot player or the goalkeeper to step between them and enable greater coverage of the pitch to progress the ball.<ref name="Thomas Tuchel's coaching playbook"/> This approach yielded a European-best 1.6 expected goal (xG) difference per game, which measures both the quality of chances created and conceded by a team.<ref name="Thomas Tuchel's coaching playbook"/> However, according to Mark Carey of ''The Athletic'', Tuchel's approach at Bayern struggled when facing low-block teams who denied Bayern space to create, while also stating the team was vulnerable on the counter-attack if they committed more players forward: the club registered three shock defeats with 65% ball possession that season and conceded 10 goals via counter-attacks, the fifth-highest in the league.<ref name="Thomas Tuchel's coaching playbook"/> Carey also labelled the club's relative better performance in the Champions League that season to the team's approach working against clubs willing to attack them, as opposed to those who sat back. He also said Tuchel succeeded in making "subtle [tactical] tweaks in crucial moments" to win games at Bayern.<ref name="Thomas Tuchel's coaching playbook"/>

===Reception===
Klopp, his contemporary, commenting on Tuchel's "exceptional" rise through the ranks remarked, "He's an outstanding coach and an outstanding manager".<ref>{{cite web |title=Jurgen Klopp exclusive interview: Liverpool boss on his career, Wembley record and Thomas Tuchel ahead of Carabao Cup final against Chelsea |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/12549480/jurgen-klopp-exclusive-interview-liverpool-boss-on-his-career-wembley-record-and-thomas-tuchel-ahead-of-carabao-cup-final-against-chelsea |archive-url=https://archive.today/20220226060738/https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/12549480/jurgen-klopp-exclusive-interview-liverpool-boss-on-his-career-wembley-record-and-thomas-tuchel-ahead-of-carabao-cup-final-against-chelsea |date=25 Feb 2022 |archive-date=26 February 2022 |work=Sky Sports }}</ref> Guardiola also expressed his admiration for Tuchel's footballing philosophy, saying, "He's so creative.

I enjoy watching his teams, the way he plays [and] his approach".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/chelsea/news/hes-so-creative-pep-guardiola-hails-chelsea-manager-thomas-tuchel |date=14 Jan 2022 |title='He's So Creative' - Pep Guardiola Hails Chelsea Manager Thomas Tuchel |archive-url=https://archive.today/20220313090006/https://www.si.com/soccer/chelsea/news/hes-so-creative-pep-guardiola-hails-chelsea-manager-thomas-tuchel |archive-date=13 March 2022 |last=Hemming |first=Jago |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]]}}</ref> Hansi Kleitsch, the head coach of the various youth teams at [[VfB Stuttgart]] when Tuchel was an assistant coach, said, "[Tuchel] was able to dissect an opponent, he had X-ray vision. His match plans always worked out".<ref name="The Athletic"/>

Tuchel is known for his aptitude and positive response to new footballing trends and ideas: after leaving Mainz, Tuchel visited [[Matthew Benham]], owner of then-Championship club [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]], to learn about statistical models. Tuchel also sought out online tactical blogs instead of established coaches to inform his footballing ideas: he later hired [[René Marić]] of ''Spielverlagerung'' at Borussia Dortmund to compile scouting reports.<ref name="The Athletic"/> At Borussia Dortmund, he introduced the concept of "differential learning" patented by sport scientist Wolfgang Schollhorn, which informs that player skill is not honed by repetition but by confronting an ever-changing set of problems which demands constant adjustments.<ref name="The Athletic"/>

In November 2021, Barney Ronay wrote in ''The Guardian'' that "Tuchel's acuity, his tendency in pre- and post-match TV appearances to blurt out original thoughts, to riff on the spot, turning this thing around in his hand, seeing its edges" is a microcosm of his footballing approach. Roney also said that Tuchel demonstrates "restless intelligence, [an] obsession with detail, with football as a play of shapes and numbers and ideas".<ref>{{cite web |title=Ralf Rangnick's arrival is a response to Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea revolution |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/nov/26/ralf-rangnicks-arrival-is-a-response-to-thomas-tuchels-chelsea-revolution |date=26 Nov 2021 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20211128104915/https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/nov/26/ralf-rangnicks-arrival-is-a-response-to-thomas-tuchels-chelsea-revolution |archive-date=28 November 2021 |last=Ronay |first=Barney |work=The Guardian}}</ref> [[Gonzalo Castro]], who played under Tuchel, said, "[Tuchel] organises everything precisely, down to the last millimetre".<ref name="McCambridge"/> Tuchel is known as a fierce motivator. At Mainz, during a bike tour up a mountain, Tuchel buried the club badge and told the youth team that if they reached the 2009 U-19 Bundesliga final, he would retrieve it; according to under-19 player [[Konstantin Fring]], "We all had goosebumps. We would have killed someone for him [when he retrieved it]. We wanted to win so much. And we did".<ref name="Johnson" /> Tuchel went on to retrieve the badge.

[[Nikolče Noveski]], who played under Tuchel and Klopp, said that "for Klopp, creating a positive atmosphere was key. Thomas was more interested in the finer details; his preparation for games was unparalleled... He is a perfectionist, isn't afraid to challenge people and can be direct despite potential conflict".<ref name="McCambridge"/> Speaking on his management style, [[Marcus Bettinelli]] noted Tuchel emphasises personableness with playing and non-playing staff, saying, "...whether you're the chef, the bin man or gardener [you can] feel the atmosphere. He likes to ask how your family are, how you're doing. It's small things like that [which] help you feel comfortable".<ref name="Simon Johnson"/> Chelsea captain [[César Azpilicueta]] said that Tuchel's man management was key in bringing success for Chelsea.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cesar Azpilicueta reveals how Thomas Tuchel turned Chelsea into Champions League winners |url=https://www.90min.com/posts/cesar-azpilicueta-how-thomas-tuchel-turned-chelsea-champions-league-winners |date=10 Apr 2023 |archive-date=10 April 2023 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20230410220216/https://www.90min.com/posts/cesar-azpilicueta-how-thomas-tuchel-turned-chelsea-champions-league-winners |website=90min.com |first=Tody |last=Cudworth }}</ref> Sources close to Chelsea noted Tuchel's strong communication skills with players and light tone;<ref name="happy">{{Cite news|date=7 May 2021|title=Thomas Tuchel: Chelsea boss in the happiest phase of his professional career ahead of Man City clash|work=Sky Sports|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/12299979/tuchel-happiest-i-have-been-professionally|url-status=live|access-date=9 January 2022|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210508064919/https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/12299979/tuchel-happiest-i-have-been-professionally|archive-date=8 May 2021}}</ref> to assimilate with the playing squad, Tuchel regularly organised external team outings and activities, including cooking them ''[[weisswurst|Weißwürste]]'' and [[pretzels]].<ref name="Simon Johnson"/> As England manager, Tuchel regularly texted potential call-ups, with discussions ranging the player's recent matches and performances to offering support during a difficult run of form.<ref name="auto5"/>
