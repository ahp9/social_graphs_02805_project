'''William McIntosh Davies''' (born 31 May 1964) is a Scottish professional [[Association football|footballer]] and [[Manager (association football)|manager]] who is currently interim manager of [[Scottish Championship]] club [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Greenock Morton]]. 

He won the [[2007 Football League Championship play-off Final|2007 Championship play-offs]] with Derby County, finished as runners-up in the [[2005 Football League Championship play-off Final|2005 play-offs]] with [[Preston North End]], and reached the semi-finals in [[Football League Championship play-offs#2006|2006]] (Preston), [[Football League Championship play-offs#2010|2010]] and [[Football League Championship play-offs#2011|2011]] (both with Nottingham Forest).

==Playing career==
As a schoolboy, Davies was associated with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and he was offered a contract by then manager [[Dave Sexton]].

Davies started his professional playing career at the Scottish club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. He made his debut aged {{age in years and days|1964|5|31|1981|9|23}} against [[Brechin City F.C.|Brechin City]] on 23 September 1981, but rarely featured for the first team in his six years at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]].<ref>[https://www.fitbastats.com/rangers/player.php?playerid=1408 (Rangers player) Davies, Billy], FitbaStats</ref> He then had spells with Swedish teams [[Jönköpings Södra IF|Jönköping]]<ref>[https://www.sodrasajten.se/sasongen-1986/ Säsongen 1986] [1986 Season], Södrasajten (in Swedish)</ref> and [[IF Elfsborg|Elfsborg]]. Davies went on to play for [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] before he finished his playing career with [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] in his native Scotland.<ref name=wellnet>[http://www.motherwellnet.com/database/player-archive/d/billy-davies/ Billy Davies (player)], MotherWELLnet</ref>

==Management career==
===Motherwell===
Davies went on to player-coach and then manage Motherwell, helping them first avoid relegation with few games remaining in his first season in charge. In the next season he took them to the brink of European football. The subsequent season was less successful, due mainly to the club's financial situation. The club sold nine first-team players in the off-season and Davies resigned on 18 September 2001 after poor form saw Motherwell gain just three points from seven matches at the start of the [[2001–02 in Scottish football|2001–02 season]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Motherwell part with Davies |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/1550317.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 September 2001 |access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.motherwellnet.com/database/manager-archive/billy-davies/ Billy Davies (manager)], MotherWELLnet</ref>

===Preston North End===
Davies moved south to England and took on the role of assistant manager to former [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] national coach [[Craig Brown (footballer born 1940)|Craig Brown]] at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. Following Brown's departure on 29 August 2004, Davies was installed as caretaker manager<ref>{{cite news |title=Brown leaves Preston post |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/preston/3609772.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 August 2004 |access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref> before being given the job permanently on 27 September.<ref>{{cite news |title=Davies lands Preston job |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/preston/3693252.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 September 2004 |access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref>

Davies took Preston to the brink of the [[Premier League]] via the play-offs in May 2005 but lost in the final. Despite a difficult start to the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06 season]], a 25-game unbeaten run meant Preston went on to qualify for the play-offs for a second successive season although the side again failed to win promotion as they were knocked out by [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] after losing the semi-final second leg, after he famously left [[Elland Road]] following the first leg issuing the quote "Job done" to the media, only to lose at home and be knocked out.<ref name=fbh/>

Davies's success at [[Deepdale]] saw him linked with a number of other jobs. He was interviewed for the position at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] when it was announced that [[Alan Curbishley]] would be stepping down after 15 years as manager but Davies was unsuccessful and the job went to [[Iain Dowie]] instead.<ref>{{cite news|date=25 May 2006|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/preston/5016344.stm|title=Charlton opt against Davies moves|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=9 September 2007}}</ref> Davies then accepted an offer to manage Preston's Championship rivals [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 2 June 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=Davies unveiled as new Derby boss |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/5040106.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 June 2006 |access-date=9 September 2007}}</ref>

===Derby County===
In Davies's first season as Derby manager he led them to third place in the league and won the play-offs after defeating [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the semi-finals and then [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at [[Wembley Stadium]], ending Derby's five-year absence from the top flight – the scorer of the winning goal, [[Stephen Pearson]], was a former youth player from Davies's time at Motherwell.<ref>[https://www.motherwelltimes.co.uk/sport/football/davies-reveals-joy-pearsons-progress-2175276 Davies reveals the joy of Pearson's progress], Motherwell Times, 22 February 2016</ref> Davies signed a one-year extension to his contract. Derby struggled in the Premier League, gaining only six points from 14 games. After criticising Derby's board for lack of investment, Davies left [[Pride Park Stadium|Pride Park]] by mutual consent on 26 November 2007 with the club bottom of the league.<ref>{{cite news |title=Derby split with manager Davies |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/7112846.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 November 2007 |access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref> Some critics believed that Davies was a victim of his own success after overachieving in his first season at Pride Park,<ref>{{Cite news|publisher=BBC Derby|title=Billy Davies leaves Derby County|date=27 November 2007|access-date=2 December 2007|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/content/articles/2007/11/26/davies_departure_2007_feature.shtml}}</ref> while others cited his apparent tactical inefficiencies at top flight level,<ref name=fbh>[https://footballbh.net/2019/06/21/billy-davies-a-constant-battle-to-conform/ Billy Davies: A Constant Battle to Conform], Football Bloody Hell, 21 June 2019</ref> poor big money signings (including £3m [[Claude Davis]])<ref>{{Cite news |title= Gerald Mortimer: No sad farewell to Davis |date=2 September 2009 |access-date=3 September 2009 |url= http://www.therams.co.uk/news/Gerald-Mortimer-sad-farewell-Davis/article-1301648-detail/article.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090905062823/http://www.therams.co.uk/news/Gerald-Mortimer-sad-farewell-Davis/article-1301648-detail/article.html |archive-date=5 September 2009 |url-status=dead |work=therams.co.uk |publisher=Northcliffe Media}}</ref> and suggested Davies had engineered his own departure, in the form of an outspoken rant against the board<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=The Observer |title=Davies rages at Derby dilemma |date=25 November 2007 |access-date=3 September 2009 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/25/match.chelsea |location=London |first=Jamie |last=Jackson}}</ref> so as to avoid having a relegation on his CV.

Davies was later linked with the managerial positions of the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]] after [[Alex McLeish]] stepped down to take charge of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]<ref>{{cite news |date=27 November 2007 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/7115967.stm |title= McAllister rules out Scotland job |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date= 9 February 2009}}</ref> (Davies would eventually decide against the post),<ref>{{cite news |title=Davies out of race for Scots job |url= https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7186059.stm |publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 January 2008 |access-date=15 January 2008}}</ref> [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] (after [[Gary Megson]] left to manage [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]), as well as [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] and [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]]. Davies was also considered a candidate to become assistant manager to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] boss [[David Moyes]], a role which came vacant when [[Alan Irvine (footballer born 1958)|Alan Irvine]] left to take charge of Davies's old club Preston.<ref>{{cite news|date=8 March 2008|url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/article.php?id=82267|title=Ex-Derby boss Davies in line for Everton job|access-date=8 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312151420/http://www.tribalfootball.com/article.php?id=82267|archive-date=12 March 2008|work=tribalfootball.com}}</ref>

===Nottingham Forest===
On 31 December 2008, it was announced by [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] that the club was in negotiations with Davies to succeed the recently dismissed [[Colin Calderwood]].<ref>{{cite web|date=31 December 2008 |url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10308~1504698,00.html |title=Official Statement |publisher=Nottingham Forest F.C. |access-date=31 December 2008 |work=nottinghamforest.co.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102231753/http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10308~1504698%2C00.html |archive-date=2 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Davies was appointed as their manager on 1 January 2009, officially taking over on 5 January.<ref name="Davies appointed Forest manager">{{cite news |title=Davies appointed Forest manager |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/nottm_forest/7805993.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 January 2009 |access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref>

In the summer of 2009 Davies made several additions to his squad and spent around £4m. Despite having six first-team strikers, the season did not get off to the best start, with Forest playing well but failing to get the results many thought their performances deserved. However Forest embarked upon an 18-match unbeaten run starting at the end of September and including 10 wins, five of which came successively, to climb the table rapidly into a play-off position at the end of November.<ref>{{cite news|date=4 December 2009 |url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10308~1894505,00.html |title=Remaining Focussed |publisher=Nottingham Forest F.C. |access-date=4 December 2009 |work=nottinghamforest.co.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211151732/http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10308~1894505%2C00.html |archive-date=11 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Davies was nominated for the manager of the month award for October after guiding Forest to three successive wins and a draw, but he missed out to Dave Jones of [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].<ref>{{cite news|date=4 November 2009|url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/latestnews/20091104/manager-of-the-month-nominations_2245681_1846344|title=Manager of the Month Nominations|access-date=4 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412085855/http://www.football-league.co.uk/latestnews/20091104/manager-of-the-month-nominations_2245681_1846344|archive-date=12 April 2010|url-status=dead|work=football-league.co.uk|publisher=The Football League}}</ref> Following failure in the play-offs for the second season running,<ref name=fbh/> on 12 June 2011 Davies was dismissed as manager of Nottingham Forest.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nottingham Forest talk to McClaren after sacking Davies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/13644012|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 June 2011|access-date=9 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Billy Davies Contract Terminated |url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10308~2375078,00.html |publisher=Nottingham Forest F.C. |work=nottinghamforest.co.uk |date=12 June 2011 |access-date=9 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113010554/http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10308~2375078%2C00.html |archive-date=13 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Return to Nottingham Forest===
On 7 February 2013, Davies returned to Nottingham Forest as manager, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal, 20 months after being dismissed by the previous Forest board.<ref>{{cite news|title=Davies appointed Forest Manager|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21343978|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 February 2013|access-date=7 February 2013}}</ref> Davies took charge of his first match since coming back on 16 February 2013, a 1–1 draw against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] at the City Ground.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nottingham Forest 1–1 Bolton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21448151|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 February 2013|access-date=17 February 2013}}</ref> The first victory of his second spell came three days later, a 6–1 win at home against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Nott'm Forest 6–1 Huddersfield|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21448640|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 February 2013|access-date=19 February 2013}}</ref> This was followed by his first away game at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] where Forest won 2–0.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21482679 | title=Charlton 0-2 Nottm Forest | publisher=BBC Sport | date=24 February 2013 | access-date=31 May 2013}}</ref> Under Davies they won six games in a row, including a 2–1 away win against second placed [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], placing them fifth in The Championship table and in a play-off position.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nottingham Forest 2012/13 Fixture List|url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/fixtures-results/fixtures-list/|publisher=Nottingham Forest|date=17 March 2013|access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref> Forest were unable to sustain their form and eventually finished eighth after losing 2–3 to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on 4 May 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nott'm Forest 2 – 3 Leicester City|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22320604|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=29 May 2013|first=Owen|last=Phillips}}</ref>
On 18 October 2013, Davies signed a four-year contract extension at the [[City Ground]]. The chairman and club owner, [[Fawaz Al-Hasawi]] said "This is a fantastic day for Nottingham Forest. I look forward with great excitement to working alongside him for many years to come as we aim to bring success back to this magnificent club."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24588026 | title=Billy Davies: Nottingham Forest boss signs four-year contract | publisher=BBC Sport | date=18 October 2013 | access-date=25 March 2014}}</ref>

After an eight-game winless run left Nottingham Forest one place and two points outside of the [[Football League Championship play-offs|play-off]] positions, and having seen his side lose 5–0 to local rivals Derby County two days earlier, Davies was dismissed on 24 March 2014. A statement on Forest's website read simply: "Nottingham Forest Football Club have confirmed the termination of manager Billy Davies' employment."<ref name="bdsacked2014">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/26712368 | title=Billy Davies: Nottingham Forest sack manager | publisher=BBC Sport | access-date=25 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Club statement|url=http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/news/article/club-statement-240314-1440481.aspx|publisher=Nottingham forest|access-date=24 March 2014}}</ref>

Louise Taylor of ''[[The Guardian]]'' pointed to Davies' "paranoia", "self-destructive insecurities" and "obsession with conspiracy theories and old grudges" as the reasons behind his downfall, suggesting that he had "shattered" his reputation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/24/billy-davies-nippy-sweetie-nottingham-forest | title=Billy Davies left to reconsider his style by Nottingham Forest sack | work=The Guardian|location=London | date=24 March 2014 | access-date=25 March 2014}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'''s John Percy, who was one of a number of reporters who were "accused of being in league with his former employers" for questioning decisions Davies made, said that Davies was "destined for failure" because he was "obsessed" with conspiracies and hidden agendas. He pointed to the "huge funds" Davies was given to get Forest promoted and suggested that he "could have got away with" the "unsavoury" behaviour, had Forest been winning.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/championship/10718866/Billy-Davies-was-destined-for-failure-at-Nottingham-Forest-after-a-year-of-drama-fallouts-and-media-blackouts.html | title=Billy Davies was destined for failure at Nottingham Forest after a year of drama, fallouts and media blackouts | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=24 March 2014 | access-date=25 March 2014}}</ref> John Payne of ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|The Metro]]'' said that Davies owed the Forest fans an apology for his behaviour after failing to acknowledge them at the end of the defeat to Derby and "insulted fans' intelligence" by refusing to answer straight questions on the rare occasion he gave press interviews.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/03/23/say-sorry-why-billy-davies-owes-every-single-nottingham-forest-fan-an-apology-4674271/ | title=Say sorry!
