'''Michael Richard Adams''' (born 8 November 1961) is an English former professional [[association football|footballer]] and football [[Manager (association football)|manager]]. As a player, he was a [[Full-back (football)|full back]], and made a total of 438 league appearances in a 19-year professional career in the [[English Football League]], including five years with [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] at the highest level. He began his managerial career as [[Player-coach|player-manager]] for [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 1996 and has led several teams at varying levels with mixed success, being named Manager of the Season twice, and earning four [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]]s for the teams he has managed.

Born in [[Sheffield]], Adams was part of the [[Youth system|youth team]] at [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] from the age of twelve until released in 1977. He turned professional at the Third Division team [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in 1979, where he established himself in the first team, winning a move in 1983 to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] who were in the First Division. He spent four years at Coventry before being sold on to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in 1987. Southampton bought him for [[Pound sterling|£]]250,000 in 1989, where he enjoyed five years of top-flight football. He was [[Loan (sports)|loan]]ed out to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 1994 before he signed with Fulham later in the year. Appointed as Fulham's player-manager in March 1996, he led the club out of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in [[1996–97 Fulham F.C. season|1996–97]] and was named as the Third Division Manager of the Season. Sacked by Fulham despite his success, he walked out on [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] after less than two weeks in charge and instead took charge at [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in November 1997. He was sacked after the club were [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] at the end of the season. At this point, he ended his playing career.

He joined [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] as assistant manager, taking charge for one [[Premier League]] game in a [[caretaker manager|caretaker]] capacity. He returned to management with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] in April 1999. He led the club to the Third Division title in [[2000–01 Nottingham Forest F.C. season|2000–01]], winning the division's Manager of the Season award for a second time. He then moved to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] as an assistant before finally being named the club's manager in April 2002. He took the club to the Premier League as [[Football League First Division|First Division]] runners-up in [[2002–03 Leicester City F.C. season|2002–03]]. However, he tendered his resignation in October 2004, failing to keep the club in the top flight. He took charge at former club Coventry City in January 2005, though he lost his job in January 2007. He returned to Brighton in May 2008, though his second spell in charge would only last nine months. He was appointed manager of [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in June 2009 before departing for Sheffield United in December 2010. He failed to prevent United from being relegated into [[EFL League One|League One]] and was sacked in May 2011; this enabled him to return to Port Vale as manager. Despite starting the season in [[Administration (British football)|administration]], he led Vale to promotion into League One in 2012–13. He resigned as Vale manager in September 2014 and took charge at [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] the following month. He left Tranmere with the club bottom of the Football League in April 2015. He managed Irish side [[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]] for three months starting in August 2015. After leaving management in 2015, he started his football consultancy business.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Adams was born in [[Sheffield]], [[Yorkshire]], and was an associate schoolboy with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] from the age of twelve,<ref name="su" /> where his boyhood idol was [[Tony Currie (footballer)|Tony Currie]].<ref name="cn" /> He was a favourite of manager [[Jimmy Sirrel]]. However, Adams was released from the [[Youth system|youth team]] set-up a few months after [[Harry Haslam (footballer, born 1921)|Harry Haslam]] replaced Sirrel as [[Manager (association football)|manager]]  in September 1977.<ref name="su">{{cite web|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Adams-goes-roots-Blades-return/story-12577022-detail/story.html|title=Port Vale: Adams goes back to his roots with a Blades return|last=Shaw|first=Steve|date=11 August 2009|work=[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel]]|access-date=17 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116141046/http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Adams-goes-roots-Blades-return/story-12577022-detail/story.html|archive-date=16 January 2014}}</ref>

===Gillingham===
United's youth team [[Coach (sport)|coach]] John Short also left the club and became a coach at [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], and so Adams then travelled {{convert|240|mi}} out from home to join Gillingham as an apprentice in August 1978.<ref name="up close">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2004/08/19/micky_adams_in_depth_interview_feature.shtml|title=Micky Adams up close|date=19 August 2004|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2 October 2011}}</ref> During his time as an apprentice he won four caps for the [[England national under-17 football team|England youth team]], and competed in a tournament in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref name="up close" /> He went on to sign as a professional at Gillingham in November 1979. Due to his natural pace, Adams started his playing career as a [[Outside forward|left-winger]] before manager [[Keith Peacock]] converted him into a left-back after he was found to lack the [[Association football tactics and skills|technical skill]] necessary to beat opponents.<ref name = "ITN">{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last1= Holley |first1= Duncan |last2= Chalk|first2= Gary | publisher=Hagiology Publishing | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-9534474-3-5|page=472}}</ref> Coming through the club's ranks at the same time as [[Steve Bruce]], Adams later cited [[Bill Collins (footballer, born 1920)|Buster Collins]] as a major influence upon his career.<ref name="Buster">{{cite news|title=Adams and Bruce were Buster's premier pupils |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |access-date=27 September 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2004/03/07/sfnpb207.xml |date=6 March 2004 |first=Patrick |last=Barclay |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118132027/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fsport%2F2004%2F03%2F07%2Fsfnpb207.xml |archive-date=18 November 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In [[1982–83 Gillingham F.C. season|1982–83]] he was named in the [[Professional Footballers' Association|PFA]]'s Third Division [[PFA Team of the Year|Team of the Year]].<ref name="pfa">{{Cite book | last = Lynch | title = The Official P.F.A.

===Coventry City and Leeds United===
After 103 appearances for [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] Gillingham he moved on to top-flight [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in 1983 for a fee approaching [[Pound sterling|£]]85,000.<ref>{{cite book | first=Roger|last= Triggs | title=The Men Who Made Gillingham Football Club| publisher=Tempus Publishing Ltd | year=2001| isbn=978-0-7524-2243-5|page=38}}</ref> He struggled with injury during his time at [[Highfield Road]], and was never popular with the fans.<ref name="up close" /> [[Keith Houchen]] also recalled that he did not get along with manager [[John Sillett]] and was prone to sulking when left out of the team.<ref>Strange, Jonathan. ''A Tenner and Box of Kippers: The Story of Keith Houchen'' p. 104 (Stadia, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-7524-3796-5}})</ref> Despite this he managed to play over 100 games for City over four years before [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] manager [[Billy Bremner]] took him to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] for a £110,000 fee. Near the end of his first season at Leeds, he played in the club's [[FA Cup semi-finals|FA Cup Semi-final]] defeat to former club Coventry at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]], as Coventry won 3–2 in [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/OnThisWeek/0,,10269~1030058,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515214638/http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/OnThisWeek/0%2C%2C10269~1030058%2C00.html |archive-date=15 May 2012 |title=Hillsborough History |publisher=ccfc.co.uk. |date=26 May 2007 |access-date=17 November 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Leeds suffered further heartbreak in 1987 by losing the [[1987 Football League Second Division play-off final|play-off final]] to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], again after extra time.

===Southampton===
His return to [[Football League First Division|First Division]] football came in March 1989 when [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] offered Leeds £250,000 for his services.<ref name="Sentinel">{{cite web|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Micky-Adams-career-far/story-12582327-detail/story.html|title=Micky Adams career so far|date=4 June 2009|work=The Sentinel|access-date=17 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610220817/http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Micky-Adams-career-far/story-12582327-detail/story.html|archive-date=10 June 2015}}</ref> Adams made his debut for the "Saints" on 25 March 1989, taking [[Derek Statham]]'s place at left-back in a 3–1 defeat by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Adams retained his place for the next seven games before losing out to [[Gerry Forrest]] for the last few matches of the season.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |page=206}}</ref> Adams played the first seven matches of [[1989–90 Southampton F.C. season|the 1989–90 season]] before losing his place through injury to [[Francis Benali]], who then began to form a useful full-back partnership with [[Jason Dodd]]. In April 1990, Adams was recalled alongside new signing [[Oleksiy Cherednyk]], and they played out the remainder of the season together.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |page=213}}</ref>

Adams began to establish himself as the first-choice left-back at the start of [[1990–91 Southampton F.C. season|the 1990–91 season]], partnered first by Cherednyk and then Dodd, and finally by [[Barry Horne (footballer)|Barry Horne]] on the right.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |page=219}}</ref> Once he had overcome the niggling injuries of his first two seasons at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]], Adams' consistency began to ensure that the left-back position was more or less his own, with his energetic forays along the [[touchline]] helping to give the side an extra cutting edge.<ref name = "ITN"/> His first goals for the Saints came in [[1991–92 Southampton F.C. season|the 1991–92 season]] against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |page=223}}</ref> Against West Ham on 14 April 1992, he scored the only goal with a far-post [[Volley (association football)|volley]] in the 88th minute after [[Matt Le Tissier]] had created space to whip over a [[Cross (association football)|cross]]: the goal was described as "a moment of true class in an otherwise ordinary game".<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |page=222}}</ref>

During [[1992–93 Southampton F.C. season|the inaugural season]] of the [[Premier League]], Adams missed only four games, making 38 appearances with four goals, with his right-wing partner now being [[Jeff Kenna]], with manager [[Ian Branfoot]] playing Dodd and Benali further forward.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |page=228}}</ref> He was [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] for dissent on 19 August 1992 against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] at [[Loftus Road]], during the second game of the season.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |page=224}}</ref> The [[1993–94 Southampton F.C. season|1993–94]] Premiership season was Adams' last in the top flight; he started the season as the preferred choice at left-back before losing out to [[Simon Charlton]]. He featured in 19 out of 42 league games that season as Southampton finished 18th and narrowly avoided [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]]. His final game for Southampton came in a 1–0 defeat at home to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], immediately following which Branfoot was sacked as manager to be replaced by [[Alan Ball Jr.|Alan Ball]].<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |page=235}}</ref>

====Stoke City (loan) ====
Adams never played under Ball and was [[Loan (sports)|loan]]ed out to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in March 1994 until the end of the season.<ref name = "ITN"/> He scored three goals in ten games for the "Potters" but did not join the club permanently as the management staff refused to allow him to help out as a coach at the club's academy.<ref name="up close" /> In his five years with Southampton, Adams made 174 first-team appearances, scoring seven goals.<ref name = "ITN"/>

===Fulham===
In July 1994, he joined [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on a [[Free transfer (association football)|free transfer]] where he was reunited with Ian Branfoot in preparation for the "Cottagers" [[1994–95 Fulham F.C. season|1994–95 season]]. Fulham had just been relegated to Division Three (the bottom tier of the professional league) for the first time in their history. He signed up with the club with the understanding that Branfoot would teach him the ropes of coaching.<ref name="up close" /> They finished seventh in the league that season, but due to a restructuring of the league, which saw one less promotion place in the three lower divisions, Fulham missed out on a [[English Football League play-offs|play-off]] place. When Branfoot became general manager in March 1996, Adams was appointed [[Player-coach|player-manager]] of a Fulham side on course for their lowest-ever finish – 17th in Division Three.

==Managerial career==
Before going into management, the "straight-talking Yorkshireman"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/lmatv/interview-3786.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310112322/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/lmatv/interview-3786.html|archive-date=10 March 2012|title=Adams aims to upset the odds|date=21 July 2003|work=[[League Managers Association|LMA]] |access-date=7 November 2009}}</ref> had already demonstrated his ability to spot talented youngsters.

===Fulham===
Having successfully coached Fulham's [[reserve team]] in the Capital League, Adams moved into management, taking over from Ian Branfoot in March 1996 with the London club languishing in 91st place in the league pyramid.<ref name="up close" /><ref>{{cite web

===Swansea to Brentford to Nottingham===
Shortly after his dismissal from Fulham, Adams quickly returned to management with [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in Division Three but left after 13 days and three matches in charge. Adams claimed that the money he had been promised to strengthen the team had not been forthcoming.<ref>{{cite news|title=You're fired: The shortest managerial reigns|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/youre-fired-michael-appleton-and-the-shortest-managerial-reigns-1869031.html?action=gallery&ino=14|work=The Independent|location=London|date=21 September 2011|access-date=17 November 2013|archive-date=9 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509124806/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/youre-fired-michael-appleton-and-the-shortest-managerial-reigns-1869031.html?action=gallery&ino=14|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Before 1997 was out, Adams took his third job of the [[1997–98 Brentford F.C. season|1997–98 season]] when he was named manager of [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]]. The club had suffered a slump in league form after losing the previous season's Division Two [[1997 Football League Second Division play-off final|play-off final]], and were struggling near the foot of the table. He signed striker [[Andy Scott (footballer, born 1972)|Andy Scott]] from Sheffield United for a fee of £75,000,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Port-Vale-Scott-ready-lock-horns-boss/story-13438795-detail/story.html|title=Port Vale: Scott ready to lock horns with former boss|date=30 September 2011|work=The Sentinel|access-date=17 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610232221/http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Port-Vale-Scott-ready-lock-horns-boss/story-13438795-detail/story.html|archive-date=10 June 2015}}</ref> as well as signing [[Glenn Cockerill]] as player/assistant manager, [[Warren Aspinall]] and [[Loan (sports)|loanee]] [[Nigel Gleghorn]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Big Brentford Book Of The Nineties|last1=Croxford|first1=Mark|last2=Lane|first2=David|last3=Waterman|first3=Greville|publisher=Legends Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781906796723|location=Sunbury, Middlesex|pages=261}}</ref> However, injuries began to mount, with [[Ijah Anderson]], [[Derek Bryan (footballer)|Derek Bryan]] and [[Ricky Reina]] all sidelined.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Big Brentford Book Of The Nineties|last1=Croxford|first1=Mark|last2=Lane|first2=David|last3=Waterman|first3=Greville|publisher=Legends Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781906796723|location=Sunbury, Middlesex|pages=262}}</ref> Adams was named as [[Football League Second Division Manager of the Month|Second Division Manager of the Month]] for March after overseeing three wins and two draws.<ref name="motma">{{Cite book|title=The Big Brentford Book Of The Nineties|last1=Croxford|first1=Mark|last2=Lane|first2=David|last3=Waterman|first3=Greville|publisher=Legends Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781906796723|location=Sunbury, Middlesex|pages=264}}</ref> Despite Adams' efforts, Brentford were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to Division Three on the last day of the season, and the club was bought out by [[Ron Noades]], who installed himself as the new Brentford manager.<ref name="CT" />

After taking a break from the game, Adams joined [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] as assistant manager under [[Dave Bassett]]. Bassett was dismissed in January 1999, and so Adams took charge as [[caretaker manager]] for a single Premiership match before [[Ron Atkinson]] was appointed as Bassett's replacement.<ref>{{cite news|title=Adams set to hand reins to Ron|first=Russell|last=Thomas|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jan/11/match.sport11|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=11 January 1999|access-date=17 November 2013}}</ref>

===Brighton & Hove Albion===
Adams returned to management in April 1999 with Division Three team [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]. The club were in the middle of a financial crisis, which had seen the board sell the [[Goldstone Ground]] to stay afloat; on the [[Football pitch|pitch]] the club were facing a battle for their league status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-312.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310112456/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-312.html|archive-date=10 March 2012|title=High flying Seagulls delight Adams |date=15 March 2001|work=LMA|access-date=7 November 2009}}</ref> His first full season as manager was a matter of consolidation as the club finished a respectable 11th, whilst Adams signed talent such as star striker [[Bobby Zamora]].

In his second season as manager, [[2000–01 Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. season|2000–01]], Adams guided Brighton to promotion as Division Three champions after spending five seasons in the league's basement division.

He was named Third Division Manager of the season for a second time, also picking up the [[Football League Third Division Manager of the Month|Third Division Manager of the Month]] award in September 2000.

Adams was clear about his ambitions of managing at a higher level, stating his disappointment at not being offered the management positions at either Southampton or West Ham United in the summer of 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-711.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310112523/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-711.html|archive-date=10 March 2012|title=Adams sad to miss Premier interviews|date=16 July 2001|work=LMA|access-date=7 November 2009}}</ref> He did leave "Seagulls" in October 2001, though by then he had already set the foundations for Brighton to achieve a second-successive promotion as Division Two champions in [[2001–02 Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. season|2001–02]].
