'''Nathan Jason Jones''' (born 28 May 1973) is a Welsh professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] who is the manager of {{English football updater|CharltoA}} club [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. He is also a former [[Association football|player]] who played as a [[left-back]] and a [[midfielder]].

Jones began his career with [[Football Conference]] club [[Merthyr Tydfil F.C.|Merthyr Tydfil]] before joining [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in the summer of 1995. He became homesick at Luton so took an opportunity to move to Spain with [[CD Badajoz|Badajoz]] and then [[CD Numancia|Numancia]] and returned to England with [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] in 1997. Jones spent three seasons at [[Roots Hall]] which included a brief loan spell with [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]] in 1999. He moved on to [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] in 2000 and was part of the team that won three promotions in five years. He joined [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] in 2005 where he spent seven seasons in [[EFL League One|League One]] making over 200 appearances.

Whilst at Yeovil, Jones began taking his coaching badges, spending time as first-team coach of [[Yeovil Town L.F.C.|Yeovil Town Ladies]] and later player-assistant manager of the first team. He left Yeovil in 2012 and joined Charlton Athletic as their [[Charlton Athletic F.C. Under-23s and Academy|under-21 professional development]] coach, a role which he held for one season. He returned to Brighton as a member of the coaching staff to [[Óscar García (footballer, born 1973)|Óscar García]], [[Sami Hyypiä]] and [[Chris Hughton]]. Jones left Brighton in January 2016 to take over as manager of [[EFL League Two|League Two]] club Luton Town. He guided Luton to the [[2017 English Football League play-offs|League Two play-offs]] in [[2016–17 Luton Town F.C. season|2016–17]] losing out to [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], but earned promotion to League One in [[2017–18 Luton Town F.C. season|2017–18]] finishing in second place.

With Luton on course for a second consecutive promotion, Jones left in January 2019 for Championship club [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]. His time at Stoke was ultimately unsuccessful, with him being dismissed in November 2019. Jones returned to Luton in May 2020, subsequently saving the club from relegation following the restart of the season after the [[COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom|UK's COVID-19 lockdown]], and guiding them to a playoff place in the [[2021–22 Luton Town F.C. season|2021–22 season]]. In November 2022, he left Luton for a second time and joined [[Premier League]] club [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], but lasted just three months in the role before he was sacked. In February 2024, Jones was appointed manager of Charlton Athletic.
