'''Ruben Filipe Marques Amorim''' ({{IPA|pt-PT|ˈʁuβɛn fɨˈlipɨ ˈmaɾkɨʃ ɐmuˈɾĩ|lang}}; born 27 January 1985) is a Portuguese [[Professional association football|professional football]] [[Manager (association football)|manager]] and former player who is currently head coach of [[Premier League]] club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].

As a footballer, Amorim played as a [[midfielder]]. He spent most of his professional career with [[C.F. Os Belenenses|Belenenses]] and [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], signing with the latter in 2008 and going on to win ten major titles, including three [[Primeira Liga|league titles]], one [[Taça de Portugal]], five [[Taça da Liga|Taças da Liga]] and one [[Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira]]. He represented [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in two [[FIFA World Cup]]s, earning a total of 14 [[Cap (sport)|caps]].

After retiring as a player in 2017, Amorim began his coaching career at [[Casa Pia A.C.|Casa Pia]] in 2018, before resigning that same year amid a dispute with the [[Portuguese Football Federation]] (FPF). He was then appointed head coach at Braga's reserve team, popularly known as [[S.C. Braga B|Braga B]], before taking charge of the [[S.C. Braga|Braga]] senior side in December 2019, winning the [[2019–20 Taça da Liga|2020 Taça da Liga]].

In March 2020, Amorim was appointed manager of [[Sporting CP]], becoming then the [[Transfer (association football)#Managers|third most expensive manager ever]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=8 September 2022 |title=The most expensive fees paid for football managers |url=https://www.90min.com/posts/the-most-expensive-fees-paid-for-football-managers |access-date=31 October 2024 |website=90min.com }}</ref> In his [[2020–21 Sporting CP season|first season]], Amorim guided the club to a [[Double (association football)#Portugal|double]] by winning both the Taça da Liga and the Primeira Liga,<ref name="LC2"/> ending the latter's 19-year league title drought. These achievements won him the [[2020–21 Primeira Liga#Annual awards|Primeira Liga's Manager of the Year]] award for the [[2020–21 Primeira Liga|2020–21 season]]. He later led them to another Primeira Liga title in the [[2023–24 Primeira Liga|2023–24 season]], being named for the second time Primeira Liga's Manager of the Year. He left the club for Manchester United in late 2024.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Amorim began his career with [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], playing in the youth team alongside [[Bruno Simão]] and [[Pedro Russiano]].<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cy8npw24w3vo|title=The story of Ruben Amorim: Man Utd's new manager branded the 'second Special One'|date=2 November 2024|website=BBC Sport}}</ref>

===Belenenses===
After being released by Benfica, Amorim went on trial with [[C.F. Os Belenenses|Belenenses]] at the suggestion of Simao, playing with a broken arm.<ref name="auto"/>

Amorim made his debut in the [[Primeira Liga]] on 14 December 2003, playing one minute for Belenenses in a 2–0 home win against [[F.C. Alverca|Alverca]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/belenenses/detalhe/belenenses-frente-ao-alverca.html|title=Belenenses frente ao Alverca|trans-title=Belenenses against Alverca|newspaper=[[Record (Portuguese newspaper)|Record]]|language=pt|date=15 December 2003|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref> He played in the [[2007 Portuguese Cup final]] for the club.<ref name="auto"/>

===Benfica===
In late April 2008, Amorim signed a four-year deal with Benfica after his Belenenses contract [[Free agent|expired]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://ionline.sapo.pt/441036|title=Ruben Amorim. Ai Jesus que lá vou eu|trans-title=Ruben Amorim. Oh Jesus here I go|newspaper=[[i (Portuguese newspaper)|i]]|language=pt|date=29 December 2011|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref> During [[2008–09 Primeira Liga|his first season]] he was a regular starter, scoring his first goal on 23 November in a 2–0 away victory over [[Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F.|Académica de Coimbra]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.jn.pt/desporto/interior/benfica-vence-0-2-a-academica-1048847.html|title=Benfica vence (0–2) a Académica|trans-title=Benfica beat (0–2) Académica|newspaper=[[Jornal de Notícias]]|language=pt|date=23 November 2008|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref>

Competing with new signings [[Javi García]] and [[Ramires]], Amorim appeared less in [[2009–10 Primeira Liga|2009–10]], but still featured prominently (24 matches with ten starts) as the side won the league – and the [[2009–10 Taça da Liga|League Cup]] – after a five-year drought. When healthy, he was again regularly used by manager [[Jorge Jesus]] in the [[2010–11 Primeira Liga|2010–11 season]]. On 19 January 2011, however, after undergoing surgery on both knees, he was sidelined for several months.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/01ed-0ea1e5694220-65e930a0262e-1000--knee-surgery-robs-benfica-of-ruben-amorim/|title=Knee surgery robs Benfica of Rúben Amorim|publisher=UEFA|date=19 January 2011|access-date=24 April 2011}}</ref>

In early October 2011, whilst on duty with the [[Portugal national football team|national team]], Amorim criticised Jesus' preferences – Benfica played most of their games without a single Portuguese player.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/benfica/detalhe/olhos-nos-olhos-719906.html|title=Ruben Amorim: "Fico feliz por Paulo Bento não pensar como Jesus"|trans-title=Ruben Amorim: "I'm happy Paulo Bento does not think as Jesus"|newspaper=Record|language=pt|date=3 October 2011|access-date=29 January 2018|archive-date=30 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130091502/http://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/benfica/detalhe/olhos-nos-olhos-719906.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Increasingly disgusted with his plight, in December, he refused to train with the bench players – after warming up for several minutes only to not be used – following a game against [[Rio Ave F.C.|Rio Ave]], being subjected to the club's disciplinary proceedings;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/benfica/ruben-amorim-benfica/1312473-1456.html|title=Benfica: Ruben Amorim é caso disciplinar|trans-title=Benfica: Ruben Amorim a disciplinary case|publisher=Maisfutebol|language=pt|date=28 December 2011|access-date=4 January 2012|archive-date=30 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190930230606/https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/benfica/ruben-amorim-benfica/1312473-1456.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ionline.pt/desporto/benfica-ruben-amorim-novo-ausente-treino-depois-incidente-disciplinar|title=Benfica.

In [[2013–14 S.L. Benfica season|2013–14]], Amorim returned to the [[Estádio da Luz]] and played 37 matches across all competitions, helping to win an unprecedent [[Treble (association football)|treble]] of [[2013–14 Primeira Liga|league]], [[2013–14 Taça de Portugal|Taça de Portugal]] and [[2013–14 Taça da Liga|Taça da Liga]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=por/news/newsid=2107634.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520031322/http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=por/news/newsid=2107634.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 May 2014|title=Benfica lift cup to seal historic treble|publisher=UEFA|date=18 May 2014|access-date=23 February 2015}}</ref> At the beginning of [[2014–15 S.L.

Amorim's only remaining hope to salvage the season came in the [[UEFA Europa League]], where on 21 May, he led United to the [[2025 UEFA Europa League final|final]] against [[Tottenham Hotspur]], where the winner would earn a place in the following season's [[UEFA Champions League]], while the loser would be left without European football entirely. At the match, United were defeated 1–0, compounding a disappointing season that saw them lose to Tottenham Hotspur for the fourth time that season. With no trophies, no European qualification, and a string of heavy defeats, Amorim's first season ended in failure, being widely condemned by the media as one of the worst campaigns in Manchester United's history.<ref>{{Cite web |last=history |first=Manchester United have officially reached one of the lowest points in their modern |title=Manchester United End One of the Worst Seasons in Their History with Europa League Final Defeat |url=https://www.beinsports.com/en-us/soccer/uefa-europa-league/articles-video/manchester-united-end-one-of-the-worst-seasons-in-their-history-with-europa-league-final-defeat-2025-05-21 |access-date=2025-05-22 |website=beIN SPORTS |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Man Utd and Tottenham set up 'titanic battle to salvage season' |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjdzkzd4p8yo |website=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 May 2025|access-date=10 May 2025}}</ref>

Amorim's approach is rooted in a belief that a squad must function as more than a sum of its parts; it must breathe as one. He treats his players as people first, athletes second. At Sporting, his leadership style fostered a sense of camaraderie that went beyond the locker room; it extended into the lives of his players.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Phoenix and the Theatre: Ruben Amorim's Quest to Revive United's Soul |url=https://breakingthelines.com/tactical-analysis/the-phoenix-and-the-theatre-ruben-amorims-quest-to-revive-uniteds-soul/|access-date=3 November 2024 |website=Breaking the Lines |date=2 November 2024 |language=pt}}</ref>

Amorim considers [[Jorge Jesus]] as his teacher, mentor, and one of his main influences. Amorim played under Jesus for close to a decade at Belenenses and Benfica. He also considers [[José Mourinho]] as one of his biggest mentors and has displayed an admiration for [[Pep Guardiola]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/ckgz0l6wnz3t?page=5|title=What type of football does Amorim play?|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=30 October 2024|access-date=31 October 2024}}</ref> Amorim himself said, "There are coaches who have a way of watching the game that I like, like Guardiola, but for me, the role model is Mourinho, because I watch the ball in a way that's more similar to [Mourinho], that is, he analyses the opponents very well and sets his team up, not just with a certain style of play but thinking a lot about how to adapt to win."<ref name="Amorimcoach">{{cite news|url=https://www.givemesport.com/ruben-amorim-coaching-career/|title=Ruben Amorim's Managerial Career So Far|publisher=GiveMeSport|date=29 October 2024|access-date=31 October 2024}}</ref>

During his tenure with Sporting CP beginning in March 2020, Amorim primarily played a [[Formation (association football)#3–4–3|3–4–3]], a system he adopted during his tenure at Casa Pia and Braga, with two midfielders, usually [[João Palhinha]] and [[Matheus Nunes]], and later, [[Morten Hjulmand]] and [[Hidemasa Morita]] in the following seasons, being responsible for protecting the defense, and emphasise the attacking capabilities of the wing-backs, like [[Pedro Porro]] and [[Nuno Mendes (footballer, born 2002)|Nuno Mendes]] at first, and later [[Geny Catamo]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=7 April 2024 |title=REPORTAGEM A BOLA Uma viagem às origens de Catamo: "É um milagre o que Amorim está a conseguir dele" {{!}} Abola.pt |url=https://www.abola.pt/futebol/noticias/uma-viagem-as-origens-de-catamo-e-um-milagre-o-que-amorim-esta-a-conseguir-dele-2023112021350687871 |access-date=10 April 2024 |website=Abola.pt |language=pt}}</ref><ref name="Tactics1"/><ref name="Tactics2">{{cite news|url=https://totalfootballanalysis.com/article/ruben-amorim-sporting-cp|title=Ruben Amorim: Sporting CP|publisher=Total Football Analysis|date=9 April 2021|access-date=9 April 2021}}</ref> When defending in a low block, Sporting's players stay behind the line of the box in order to keep a compact shape, prevent any potential shots from the edge of the box, and limit attacking opportunities. Amorim's team utilises an intense pressing style and attempts to win the ball back in the final third.<ref name="Tactics1"/><ref name="Tactics2"/>

Amorim's team use interchanging movements to distract the opposing defenders and create space for the attackers to exploit.<ref name=Tactics1/><ref name=Tactics2/> They focus on exploiting the wings and half-spaces (with players like [[Pedro Gonçalves]] playing inside with [[Pablo Sarabia]] and [[Nuno Santos (footballer, born 1995)|Nuno Santos]] sticking to the left side of the attack).<ref name=Tactics1/><ref name=Tactics2/> The [[Squad number (association football)|number 9]], firstly [[Paulinho (footballer, born November 1992)|Paulinho]] and then [[Viktor Gyökeres|Gyökeres]] after the signing of the Swede in 2023, is the only player who tends to act in terms of pressing the ball and slowing the progression of the opposition, looking to create a space in the defensive line of the opposition that can be quickly attacked, in order to allow the man in possession initially to look for a vertical passing option. Amorim has also a 3–4–3 diamond formation with three mobile defenders; plus one more covering space – becoming, in effect, a defensive midfielder, two "controlling" midfielders with responsibilities to feed the attack-minded players, one second striker, two touchline-hugging wingers and one versatile centre forward.<ref name=Tactics1/><ref name=Tactics2/>

===Reception===
Amorim is often credited with rejuvenating Sporting CP by promoting young talents, instilling a winning mentality, and developing a versatile and cohesive style of play.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newsofbahrain.com/sports/104680.html|title=Ruben Amorim set to Reignite Manchester United's glory days as new manager in historic deal|publisher=The Daily Tribune|date=31 October 2024|access-date=31 October 2024}}</ref> José Mourinho insisted that "Amorim would never change his approach regardless of the opposition and his tactics provide depth for the wingers and the striker", leading to describe Amorim's style as "always intense".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.gbnews.com/sport/football/jose-mourinho-ruben-amorim-man-utd-appointment|title=The Red Devils are set to bring in the 39-year-old as a replacement for Erik ten Hag|publisher=Britain New's Channel|date=31 October 2024|access-date=31 October 2024}}</ref>

Former Estoril head coach stated that Amorim's teams reflect his work ethic, with "he is always trying to improve his players [...] works with young talent but also with experienced players as well and what they all have in common is that they fight [...] I think he wins a lot with his communication, his message is clear and it is easy to understand. The players connect with him easily. Even on the outside, for the reporters and the public, it is really simple and really concrete".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/13243650/ruben-amorim-to-man-utd-why-sporting-coach-who-took-team-to-first-title-in-19-years-is-ready-for-the-premier-league|title=Ruben Amorim to Man Utd?

In April 2023, Manchester United player and fellow compratriot [[Bruno Fernandes]] praised Amorim's management style, believing that his skill set is adaptable to leagues outside of Portugal and had all the qualities "to be able to succeed in English, French, or Spanish football".<ref name="Amorimcoach"/> Amorim was described by [[Guillem Balagué]] of ''[[BBC Sport]]'' as a coach who's "still adding layers of knowledge to his methods but he still believes football only makes sense if those watching are thrilled by it".<ref name="Amorimcoach"/>
