'''Paul Whitehead Sturrock''' (born 10 October 1956) is a Scottish former [[association football|football]] coach and former player.

As a player, Sturrock spent his entire senior career with Dundee United, making more than five hundred appearances between 1974 and 1989. He won the [[Scottish Football League]] title with United in [[1982–83 Scottish Premier Division|1982–83]] and the [[Scottish League Cup]] twice, in [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (December)|1979]] and [[1980 Scottish League Cup Final|1980]]. He was named the [[SFWA Footballer of the Year]] in 1982. At international level, Sturrock played twenty times for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and appeared at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cups]].
  
Sturrock's managerial career began with [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] in 1993, where he went on to win the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] title in [[1996–97 Scottish First Division|1996–97]] before returning to Dundee United as manager. Since 2000, Sturrock has worked as a manager in English football, initially with [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] where he helped the club to win two promotions before moving on to a brief spell with [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. He has subsequently also managed [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] and [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] as well as returning to Plymouth for a second spell. He became [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] manager in April 2015, but left the club eight months later. According to an analysis by the ''[[Financial Times]]'' he was among the country's best ever managers, even though he has mostly managed clubs at Championship level and below.<ref name = "kuper"/>

He is known by fans as ''Luggy''<ref name=GOS/> (from the [[Scots language]] word ''lugs'', Eng: ''ears''). Sturrock announced in July 2008 that he was suffering from a mild form of [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cockcroft|first=Lucy|title=Plymouth Argyle manager Paul Sturrock is battling Parkinson's Disease |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2465455/Plymouth-Argyle-manager-Paul-Sturrock-is-battling-Parkinsons-Disease.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=25 March 2013|date=25 July 2008}}</ref> His son, [[Blair Sturrock|Blair]], was also a professional footballer.

== Early life ==
Sturrock was born in [[Ellon, Aberdeenshire]], and grew up in [[Pitlochry]], [[Perthshire]], where he was educated at the local primary and secondary schools and played for amateur side Grandtully Vale. In 1972, he joined [[Vale of Atholl F.C.|Vale of Atholl]] of the Perthshire Amateur First Division (where he returned as coach in his latter days with Dundee United), and in the 1972–73 season he scored approximately 100 goals. He then moved on to [[Bankfoot Athletic F.C.|Bankfoot Athletic]], and in the 1973–74 season he scored 53 goals as they finished 2nd in the Scottish Junior FA First Division. He had trials with Morton and St Johnstone, but was signed for [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] by then manager [[Jim McLean]] on 1 July 1974.

== Club career==
Sturrock made his debut in the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] match v [[SC Jiul Petroşani|Juil Petrosani]] of Romania on 18 September 1974 and his league debut on 28 December 1974 as a substitute against [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]].

In his first season at [[Tannadice]] he made nine League appearances and came on from the substitutes' bench for three more and in the process he scored six goals. His first goal for Dundee United was one of two he scored in a 2–2 draw with [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at Tannadice on 5 April 1975. Dundee United finished fourth in the League that year. In the following season, he made 18 League appearances, eight as sub, and scored three times. He was also played as a substitute in two of the three [[Scottish Cup]] ties and was on from the start in five out of six League Cup games and scored once. He also started in three of the four [[UEFA Cup]] games netting one in that competition, too.

[[1976–77 in Scottish football|1976–77]] not only saw Dundee United consolidate their Premier League position but throughout the campaign Sturrock was an ever-present, playing in all 36 League games and scoring 15 times. Adding that total to one each in the Scottish Cup and League Cup he was top scorer at the Club that year. He played in United's only [[Scottish Cup]] tie, a 4–1 defeat at St Mirren. He also appeared four times plus once as sub out of the six League Cup ties. In a short-lived [[Anglo Scottish Cup]] campaign he was brought on as sub in one leg of the tie against Aberdeen.

In [[1982–83 in Scottish football|1982–83]], Dundee United won the Scottish League Championship, losing only four League games during the season. Sturrock contributed to this success with eight goals in his 28 appearances. He also set up [[Ralph Milne]] for his fourth-minute opener against Dundee in the final League game. The Scottish Cup that year had been yet another early exit at the hands of [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]. Sturrock scored seven in the nine games he turned out in on the way to a League Cup quarter-final exit. He also played in seven of the eight games and scored once in a UEFA Cup run that ended with an exit in [[Prague]].

His playing career came to an end in 1989, with his final goal for United occurring on 8 April 1989 in a 2-1 victory against local rivals [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]].<ref name="DunUtdOTD1p58">{{cite book |last1=Poole |first1=Mark |title=Dundee United On This Day |date=2020 |publisher=Pitch Publishing |location=Worthing |isbn=9781785316180 |page=58}}</ref> Over the course of his playing career from 1974 to 1989, he made 385 league appearances for the club and scored 109 goals. When considering all competitions, he amassed a total of 171 goals in 576 games, which places him as the second-highest goal scorer in Dundee United's history. Following his playing career, Sturrock remained at Tannadice for the next five years in a coaching role. After twenty years of continuous service, he eventually departed the club in 1993.

In addition, Sturrock finished runner-up to [[Alan Rough]] for the [[SFWA Footballer of the Year|Scottish Writers]]' award in 1981.<ref>{{ cite web | url = https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000540/19810505/307/0018 | title = _ ALAN ROUGH IS THE "PLAYER OF THE YEAR | newspaper = The Scotsman | date = 5 May 1981 | access-date = 5 May 2023 | url-access=subscription | via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]}}</ref>

== International career ==
Sturrock made his first appearance for the [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland under-21 team]] on 12 October 1976, in a goalless draw with [[Czechoslovakia national under-21 football team|Czechoslovakia]]. Four months later, he scored in a 3–2 win against [[Wales national under-21 football team|Wales under-21s]] on 9 February 1977.

Sturrock made his full international debut for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] on 16 May 1981, and on 8 November 1981, he scored his first goal for Scotland in the 2–1 World Cup qualifier defeat against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[Lisbon]]. Sturrock won 20 [[cap (football)|cap]]s for his country, scoring three goals. He was a non-playing member of the Scotland squad for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] finals in Spain and appeared twice in Mexico in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]].

== Managerial career ==
In a 2012 study by Stefan Szymanski, economics professor at the [[University of Michigan]], Sturrock was rated as one of the best managers in English football.<ref name = "kuper">{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/f340caae-47cd-11e1-b646-00144feabdc0 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221210/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/f340caae-47cd-11e1-b646-00144feabdc0.html |archive-date=10 December 2022 |url-status=live |title=Football's best managers |first=Simon |last=Kuper |work=Financial Times |date=27 January 2012 |access-date=3 May 2016 |url-access=subscription }}</ref>

=== St Johnstone ===
In 1993, Sturrock became the manager of [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Premier Division]] team [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]]. The team were relegated to the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] at the end of the [[1993–94 Scottish Premier Division|1993–94]] season. It took a while for Sturrock to improve the club's fortunes, as they lost 4–0 to [[Stenhousemuir F.C.|Stenhousemuir]] in the [[1994–95 Scottish Cup]], and he then collapsed in the dugout at [[Tannadice Park|Tannadice]] while managing St Johnstone against Dundee United during the [[1995–96 in Scottish football|1995–96]] season.<ref name = collapse>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/67415980 |title=Sir Alex Ferguson rang Paul Sturrock in hospital corridor after heart failure |website=BBC Sport |date=15 November 2023 |accessdate=17 November 2023}}</ref> While he was recovering in hospital from the collapse, Sturrock was called by his former international manager [[Alex Ferguson]].<ref name = collapse/> Ferguson warned Sturrock that he was "trying to make bad players into good players" and to just get rid of the "bad pros" in his squad.<ref name = collapse/> Sturrock guided Saints to promotion back to the Premier Division in [[1996–97 in Scottish football|1996–97]],<ref name = collapse/> winning the [[1996–97 Scottish First Division|First Division]] by 20 points. In their first season back in the Premier Division, St Johnstone finished in fifth place in [[1997–98 Scottish Premier Division|1997–98]].

=== Dundee United ===
In September 1998 Sturrock was appointed manager at Dundee United. He made a bright start to his time as manager at Tannadice, where he was feted by the fans for his excellent spell as a player. His United team failed to recover from the sale of top scorer [[Billy Dodds]] in December 1999, when they were lying third in the table. The team scored few goals following Dodds's departure, and Sturrock resigned after two games of the [[2000–01 in Scottish football|2000–01]] season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/history6.asp|title=Club History|publisher=Dundee United FC|access-date=25 March 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921170058/http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/history6.asp|archive-date=21 September 2012}}</ref>

=== Plymouth Argyle ===
In October 2000 Sturrock joined [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], a club which had reached the lowest ebb in its history, struggling in the English [[Football League Third Division]].<ref name=GOS>{{cite web|last=Prior|first=Peggy|title=Paul Sturrock 2000–2004|url=http://www.greensonscreen.co.uk/managers.asp?name=PaulSturrock|work=Argyle Managers|publisher=Greens on Screen|access-date=25 March 2013|archive-date=4 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804073608/http://www.greensonscreen.co.uk/managers.asp?name=PaulSturrock|url-status=dead}}</ref> A shake-up at boardroom level took place, Sturrock began to build his own squad. The following season, he guided them to the Third Division title breaking numerous records in the process, including a club and league points total of 102. In October 2003, Sturrock had successfully taken Argyle back to the top of the [[Football League Second Division]] and left when Plymouth had just 12 games to play in what would prove to be another season when they would finish as divisional champions and return to the [[Football League Championship]], formerly known as the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. As a result of his success at [[Home Park]] he was named as the manager of Argyle's Team of the Century in a [[BBC Devon]] poll.<ref>{{cite web
|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/sport/2004/may/plymouth_team_of_century.shtml  |title=Plymouth Argyle's Team of the Century |publisher=BBC  |access-date=17 February 2021 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040818140754/http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/sport/2004/may/plymouth_team_of_century.shtml |archive-date = 18 August 2004}}</ref>

=== Southampton ===
Sturrock was named as the successor to [[Gordon Strachan]] as manager of [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 4 March 2004. On 23 August 2004, it was announced that Sturrock was leaving the club 'by mutual consent', after a disappointing run of form and rumours of player unrest and boardroom dissatisfaction with his management.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sturrock leaves Saints |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/southampton/3590316.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 August 2004 |access-date=25 March 2013}}</ref>

=== Sheffield Wednesday ===
Sturrock was then appointed by [[Football League One|League One]] club [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] languishing in 14th place on 23 September 2004, and he guided the club to the League One play-offs. After beating [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in the semi-final with an aggregate score of 3–1, Sturrock took Wednesday to the play-off [[2005 Football League One play-off final|final]] at the [[Millennium Stadium]] and beat [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] 4–2 after extra-time, winning promotion to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. Despite numerous injuries to key players he helped Wednesday to finish 10 points clear of relegation in their first season back in The Championship.

A slow start to the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] season sparked rumours that Wednesday were about to sack Sturrock, but this speculation looked to be false when he agreed a new four-year contract on 14 September. But he was sacked on the evening of 19 October,<ref>{{cite news|title=Sturrock axed by Owls |url=http://www.football.co.uk/sheffield_wednesday/sturrock_axed_by_owls_235835.shtml |publisher=football.co.uk |date=19 October 2006|access-date=25 March 2013}}</ref> just five weeks and three games after agreeing this new deal. The new contract was agreed while the club were at the bottom of the League, while he was sacked when they were fourth from bottom.

=== Swindon Town ===
In late October 2006, [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] allowed their management team of [[Dennis Wise]] and [[Gustavo Poyet]] to join [[Leeds United]]. Swindon pounced at the opportunity to acquire the services of Sturrock and on 7 November 2006 Sturrock was confirmed as manager with [[Kevin Summerfield]] and [[John Blackley]] following him from Wednesday.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sturrock takes charge at Swindon |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/swindon_town/6122060.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 November 2006 |access-date=25 March 2013}}</ref> Sturrock's first season in charge at Swindon was a success, achieving promotion from [[Football League Two|League Two]] to [[Football League One|League One]].

Swindon made a decent start to the 2007–08 season, maintaining their position in the top half of the league table after the first 8 games.

=== Return to Plymouth ===
On 27 November 2007, Sturrock resigned his post as Swindon Town manager after just over a year with the club to rejoin previous club [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]]. Sturrock also brought back to the club assistants [[Kevin Summerfield]] and [[John Blackley]], who were previously with him during his first successful spell as manager.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bright|first=Richard|title=Paul Sturrock comes full circle to Plymouth |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2326786/Paul-Sturrock-comes-full-circle-to-Plymouth.html|date=27 November 2007|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=25 March 2013}}</ref> Sturrock then proceeded to take the club to its highest league position in 20 years: tenth in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]].<ref name=GOS2>{{cite web|last=Prior|first=Peggy|title=Paul Sturrock 2007–2009 |url=http://www.greensonscreen.co.uk/managers.asp?name=PaulSturrock2|work=Argyle Managers|publisher=Greens on Screen |access-date=25 March 2013}}</ref> However, the team subsequently struggled and finished five points and one place outside the Championship relegation zone in the [[The Football League 2008–09|2008–09 season]].<ref name=GOS2/> On 10 December 2009, Sturrock was removed as Plymouth Argyle manager and put into a business support role by chairman Sir Roy Gardner.<ref name=GOS2/> On 22 April 2010, the Plymouth board confirmed that Sturrock had left his role within the club to pursue other managerial opportunities. Following Sturrock's departure, it emerged that the board had mis-managed the finances of the club and Argyle entered [[administration (British football)|administration]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/ARGYLE-CLEAR-TAX-DEBT-WEEK/story-11451573-detail/story.html |title=CASH-strapped Plymouth Argyle is hoping to avoid appearing in the High Court by paying off its debt to the taxman – possibly as early as this week &#124; South West business news &#124; Plymouth Herald |access-date=11 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924074454/http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/ARGYLE-CLEAR-TAX-DEBT-WEEK/story-11451573-detail/story.html |archive-date=24 September 2015}}</ref>

=== Southend United ===
On 5 July 2010, Sturrock was confirmed as manager of [[Football League Two|League Two]] [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]]. Former [[Salisbury City F.C.|Salisbury City]] manager [[Tommy Widdrington]] was named as Sturrock's assistant manager<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/southend_utd/8787730.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Sturrock named as Southend boss | date=5 July 2010|access-date=25 March 2013}}</ref> while one of Sturrock's former players at [[Plymouth Argyle]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday]], who served as captain at the latter, [[Graham Coughlan]] was soon appointed as a player-coach.

Sturrock faced the tough task of rebuilding the Southend side with only five first team players available for selection at one stage of pre-season, with only [[Anthony Grant (footballer, born 1987)|Anthony Grant]], [[Matt Paterson]] and [[Scott Spencer (footballer)|Scott Spencer]] surviving. He soon appointed new signing [[Craig Easton]], who he had previously managed at [[Swindon Town]], as captain while another player from one of Sturrock's old clubs, [[Chris Barker]], was later appointed as vice-captain, having initially been signed on loan, and then permanently on deadline day.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/southend_utd/8958632.stm| publisher=BBC News| title=Southend sign Barker| date=31 August 2010|access-date=25 March 2013}}</ref> It was not an easy task for Sturrock as his assistant, [[Tommy Widdrington]] left for "footballing reasons" on Wednesday 15 December 2010.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/southend_utd/9289782.stm| publisher=BBC News| title=Widdrington leaves Southend| date=15 December 2010|access-date=25 March 2013}}</ref> After a mid table finish in his first season, he enjoyed more success during the 2011–12 season where Southend led [[Football League Two|League Two]] for most of the campaign.

=== Managerial record ===
Research by football economists [[Simon Kuper]] and Stefan Szymanski found Sturrock to be among the highest performing managers in English football. The measure was based on game success after allowing for the clubs' wage bills.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f340caae-47cd-11e1-b646-00144feabdc0 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221210/https://www.ft.com/content/f340caae-47cd-11e1-b646-00144feabdc0 |archive-date=10 December 2022|title=Football's best managers|last=Kuper|first=Simon|date=27 January 2012|work=Financial Times|url-access=subscription}}</ref>
