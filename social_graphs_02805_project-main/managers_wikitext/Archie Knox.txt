'''Archibald Gall Knox''' (born 1 May 1947) is a Scottish [[association football|football]] player and coach.  He was most recently the assistant manager of [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] until leaving the club in March 2013.

Knox worked with [[Alex Ferguson]] as an assistant manager at Aberdeen and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and with [[Walter Smith]] at [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].

==Playing career==
As a player, Knox played in his native Scotland, featuring for [[Forfar Athletic F.C.|Forfar Athletic]] (twice), [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]], [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] and a short spell with [[Montrose F.C.|Montrose]]. During his time with Dundee United, Knox was a runner-up in the 1974 [[Scottish Cup]] final, his only honour as a player.

==Managerial career==
Knox's first managerial role came in a [[player-manager]] capacity when he returned to first club Forfar in 1976, spending four years in the dual role. In 1980, Knox became assistant to [[Alex Ferguson]] at [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], helping the team to two Scottish Cups, the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] and subsequent [[UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup]] in his three years with the Dons. In 1983, Knox returned to management with [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]], where he would spend two-and-a-half years, with a best finish of sixth place in 1984–85 and 1985–86, narrowly missing out on UEFA Cup qualification. There then followed a short spell back at Aberdeen, where he was made co-manager so Ferguson could fulfil his duties as Scotland manager. He went on to join Ferguson at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 1986, where he stayed until April 1991.<ref name = "ferguson">{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/aberdeen/interview-archie-knox-former-right-hand-man-of-alex-ferguson-recalls-life-at-manchester-united-1-1938620 |title=Interview: Archie Knox, former right hand man of Alex Ferguson, recalls life at Manchester United |work=The Scotsman |date=30 October 2011 |access-date=26 March 2019}}</ref> At this point, Knox came back to Scotland, becoming assistant to [[Walter Smith]] at [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]],<ref name = "ferguson"/> where the pair would enjoy six titles over the next seven years together. In July 1998, both men moved south to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], although their time was ended by March 2002.

It was at this point that Knox's association with the national team began, with a three-year spell assisting then-manager [[Craig Brown (footballer born 1940)|Craig Brown]]. Short spells followed at [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] (as assistant to [[Mark McGhee]] and [[Eric Black]] respectively) before returning to Scotland as [[Richard Gough]]'s assistant at [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]] in November 2004. Knox again assisted the national team as a coach, helping at the [[Kirin Cup]] in May 2006. Knox was appointed [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland under-21]] manager in July 2006 following [[Rainer Bonhof]]'s departure. In August 2007 he was appointed as Bolton's Assistant Manager by Wanderers manager [[Sammy Lee (footballer)|Sammy Lee]].<ref name="knox">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bolton_wanderers/6970664.stm|title=Knox quits Scotland for Bolton|publisher=BBC Sport|date=30 August 2007}}</ref> When Lee left Knox was made caretaker manager for two games (against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and in the UEFA Cup against [[S.C. Braga]]) before [[Gary Megson]] took over. Knox remained at the club under Megson.

Two days after [[Bolton Wanderers]] secured their premiership status he was axed by Megson with six other members of the coaching staff at the club. The club denied it was due to cost-cutting measures and stated it was due to Megson wanting to bring in his own staff.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2008/05/14/bolton-axe-archie-knox-in-end-of-season-shake-up-89520-20417253/|title=Bolton axe Archie Knox in end of season shake-up|publisher=Daily Mirror|date=14 May 2008|access-date=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725045243/http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2008/05/14/bolton-axe-archie-knox-in-end-of-season-shake-up-89520-20417253/|archive-date=25 July 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>
