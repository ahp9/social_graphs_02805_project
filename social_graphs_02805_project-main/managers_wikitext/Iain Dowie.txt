'''Iain Dowie''' (born 9 January 1965) is a [[Coach (sport)|football manager]], former professional footballer and sports television pundit.

He played as a [[striker (association football)|striker]] from 1983 until 2001, notably in the [[Premier League]] for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. He earned 59 caps for [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]], scoring 12 goals. He also played in the [[Football League]] for [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], and in Non-league for [[Cheshunt F.C.|Cheshunt]], [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City]] and [[Hendon F.C.|Hendon]]. 

After retiring from playing he went on to manage [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] before joining [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] in a football management consultant. He has since worked as a pundit largely for [[Sky Sports]].

==Club career==
Born in [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]], [[Hertfordshire]], Dowie was rejected by [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] aged 16 and later went to the [[University of Hertfordshire]] to study for a [[Engineer's degree#In the United Kingdom|MEng degree]] in [[engineering]]. On completion he became an employee of [[British Aerospace]], whilst keeping up football at [[non-League football|non-League]] level playing for [[Cheshunt F.C.|Cheshunt]] alongside his brother Bob. He left Cheshunt to improve his fitness and signed for [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City]], then moved on to [[Hendon F.C.|Hendon]]. While playing for Hendon, Dowie was spotted by [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] who signed him in the [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]] season, when they were in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. He then moved in quick succession to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] (a brief [[loan (association football)|loan]] spell), before establishing himself as a [[First team (association football)|first team]] player in the [[1989–90 in English football|1989–90]] season when his eight goals in 29 league games helped Luton finish seventeenth.<ref name=profile>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/charlton/article1084332.ece|title=Profile: Iain Dowie|work=The Times|date=1 August 2003|access-date=4 April 2009| location=London|first=Sadie|last=Gray}}{{dead link|date=September 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

On 22 March 1991, with Luton still in the First Division and Dowie still a first team regular with seven goals from 29 games that season, Dowie agreed to join [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] chasers [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] for a [[fee]] of £480,000. He proved himself to be a competent deputy for the injured [[Trevor Morley]] as his four goals in the final 12 league games of the season secured the team's promotion as Second Division runners-up. But when the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92]] season began, Morley had returned to fitness and Dowie found himself on the sidelines until his £500,000 move to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 3 September 1991 after less than six months at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]].

He played alongside [[Alan Shearer]] and [[Matthew Le Tissier]] – two of the country's highest regarded strikers in the early 1990s – and scored nine goals in 30 league games to ensure that the team finished high enough for a place in the newly formed [[Premier League|FA Premier League]]. His good form continued in the [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93]] season, despite the loss of Shearer, as he scored 11 league goals. His tally dropped to five goals in 39 games during the [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94]] season, though the club avoided relegation again, and he managed another five goals from 17 league games in the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95]] season before manager [[Alan Ball Jr.|Alan Ball]] decided that he wanted younger partners for Le Tissier in attack, signing [[Gordon Watson (footballer, born 1971)|Gordon Watson]] and [[Neil Shipperley]] while dropping [[Craig Maskell]] and selling Dowie to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] for £400,000 on 13 January 1995.

His spell at Palace was a frustrating one; he was cup-tied for the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] semi-finals against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/fowler-has-the-fizz-for-liverpool-1610562.html|title=Fowler has the fizz for Liverpool |work=The Independent|location=London |date=9 March 1995|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref> and Palace reached the [[FA Cup]] semi-finals where they lost to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] after a replay. Lastly, despite a dynamic fightback after being three goals down to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on the final day of the season, they still lost 3–2 and were relegated from the Premier League one season after promotion.<ref>[http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=39598 Iain Dowie] www.sporting-heroes.net</ref>

He then spent nearly three years back at West Ham. During his time back at West Ham, he came under fire from the supporters for going long periods without scoring at a time when the team were struggling for goals and had a crisis in attack. In fact, Dowie is probably best remembered by West Ham fans for scoring a bizarre headed [[own goal]] in an infamous defeat to [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in front of the live Sky cameras at Edgeley Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/blogs/football-banter/Rocket-science-own-goals-and-bouncebackability-The-life-and-times-of-Iain-Dowie-10-things-you-need-to-know-about-Phil-Brown-s-replacement-as-the-new-Hull-City-boss-article358609.html |title=Rocket science, own goals and bouncebackability – The life and times of Iain Dowie |publisher=Mirrorfootball.co.uk |access-date=4 May 2010}}</ref> Dowie then moved across London to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] (QPR), where he ended his days playing in [[defender (association football)|defence]], and being [[player-manager]] of QPR's [[reserve team]]. Dowie also had a brief spell as [[caretaker manager]] of QPR in the autumn of 1998, between the dismissal of [[Ray Harford]] and appointment of [[Gerry Francis]].<ref name="profile"/>

==International career==
Dowie's father was born in [[Belfast]],<ref name="ATS" /> thus qualifying him to play for [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]], for whom Dowie gained 59 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scored 12 goals.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nifootball.blogspot.com/2006/10/iain-dowie.html|title=Iain Dowie international career profile |work=Northern Ireland Football Greats|access-date=17 March 2010}}</ref>

==Managerial career==

===Oldham Athletic===
After retirement from playing, Dowie then became assistant manager of [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]]. However, following the dismissal of manager [[Mick Wadsworth]], Dowie became manager and led the club into the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] play-offs in the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03]] season after spending heavily. However, financial trouble hit Oldham and Dowie lost much of his first team squad. Funds were so hard for the club at the time that Dowie along with the remaining members of the squad were not paid for several months. Dowie tried to stick out the post for as long as possible until he decided to move on citing the need to support his family as a reason.{{cn|date=July 2023}}

===Crystal Palace===
On 21 December 2003, Dowie was appointed manager of Crystal Palace, inheriting a squad with low morale and occupying 19th place in Division One. However, under his leadership, the club went on an impressive run that included 17 wins from 23 games after he took over, until the end of the season, enabling the club to finish in sixth place in the First Division, just scraping into the play-off places. This feat was attributed to complete change in the atmosphere and training regime at the club, including a tougher disciplinary regime, introduced by Dowie.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brodkin|first=Jon|title=How Dowie set up the Palace revolution|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/may/08/sport.comment4|access-date=17 March 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 May 2004}}</ref> After beating [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the semi-final, on a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]], the club beat Dowie's former club West Ham by a single goal in the Final for a place in the FA Premier League. Dowie's squad contained some promising footballers, including Andrew Johnson. Dowie made a couple of signings to the Crystal Palace squad: he signed goalkeeper [[Gabor Kiraly]] to challenge [[Julián Speroni]] for the number 1 top. Kiraly was first choice throughout the season.  The club lasted only one season there, being relegated on the final day of the season when [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] scored a late equaliser in a 2–2 draw.

He remained at Palace when the club was relegated to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] despite rumours that he was approached by other Premier League clubs to take over.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} The only actual report of a club approaching Palace to speak to Dowie was when [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] chairman [[Milan Mandarić]] approached Palace [[chairman]] [[Simon Jordan]] to speak to Dowie, in November 2005. Jordan refused this approach, and for the meantime Dowie remained at [[Selhurst Park]].{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

After losing the play-off semi final to eventual winners [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], Dowie left Crystal Palace by "mutual consent" on 22 May 2006 following discussions with chairman Jordan.<ref name="Boss Dowie leaves post at Palace">{{cite news| title = Boss Dowie leaves post at Palace| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/5001988.stm| website = BBC Sport| date = 22 May 2006| access-date =19 February 2007}}</ref> He had been allowed to leave without compensation being paid to Crystal Palace as he had wanted to be nearer to his family in [[Bolton]].<ref name=Jordancpfc>{{cite news|last=Grant|first=Alistair|title=Dowie called 'deceitful' by High Court judge|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2315239/Dowie-called-deceitful-by-High-Court-judge.html|access-date=17 March 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=15 June 2007}}</ref> Jordan was infuriated when just eight days later, on 30 May 2006, Premier League club Charlton unveiled Dowie as their new manager.<ref name=Jordancpfc/>

Jordan then issued Dowie with a writ, claiming that he had misled him about his reasons for leaving Crystal Palace.<ref name="Palace take action against Dowie">{{cite news| title = Palace take action against Dowie| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/5029950.stm| website = BBC Sport| date = 30 May 2006| access-date =19 February 2007}}</ref> Dowie, however, insisted this was not the case, and was publicly backed by both Charlton Chief Executive Peter Varney, who branded the writ "a sad and pathetic publicity stunt", and chairman [[Richard Murray (businessman)|Richard Murray]], who was adamant that his legal team could find no grounds for the writ to be upheld, and suggested that there may be more personal reasons behind the writ being issued.<ref name="Dowie: Writ won't spoil big day">{{cite news| title = Dowie: Writ won't spoil big day| url = http://home.skysports.com/list.asp?hlid=390992&CPID=8&CLID=33&lid=&title=Dowie:+Writ+won%27t+spoil+big+day&channel=| publisher = Sky Sports| date = 30 May 2006| access-date = 19 February 2007}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The case was heard in the [[High Court of Justice|London High Court]] in the summer of 2007, and on 14 June [[Michael Tugendhat|The Hon. Mr Justice Tugendhat]] ruled that Dowie had "deceived" Jordan and made "false representations" in conversations with Crystal Palace on 20 and 22 May, stating he had had no contact with Charlton when he had in fact spoken to them on 17 and 22 May.<ref name=Jordancpfc/> Dowie was ordered to pay Palace's legal bill, estimated at up to £400,000 and a similar amount to his own legal team in addition to compensation due to Crystal Palace.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dowie ordered to pay out 'cataclysmic' legal costs|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/22/newsstory.sport10|access-date=17 March 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 June 2007}}</ref> In 2008 an out-of-court agreement between Dowie and Crystal Palace was reached "on terms acceptable to Crystal Palace Football Club".<ref>{{cite news|title=Palace settles dispute with Dowie|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7332416.stm|website=BBC Sport|access-date=17 March 2012|date=5 April 2008}}</ref>

===Charlton Athletic===
When Dowie took over at the Valley, he was given more money than any previous manager to spend on players. He signed [[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink]], and [[Scott Carson]] on loan, but was unable to prevent the team suffering a disastrous start to the Premier League season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Rob|title=Top 10 most underwhelming managerial appointments|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/8189019/Top-10-most-underwhelming-managerial-appointments.html|access-date=17 March 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=9 December 2010}}</ref> Despite this, the team reached the quarter-final of the League Cup for the first time in their history. However, Dowie was unable to lift the team away from the relegation zone of the Premier League and build on the success of former manager [[Alan Curbishley]], resulting in him and the club parting company on 13 November 2006, after just 15 games in charge.<ref name="Charlton part company with Dowie">{{cite news| title = Charlton part company with Dowie| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/6145292.stm| website = BBC Sport| date = 13 November 2006| access-date =19 February 2007}}</ref>

Soon after his departure from Charlton, in December 2006, he was linked with the vacant managers job at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], but he turned down the position.<ref name="Dowie turns down job as Hull boss">{{cite news

On 29 August, Dowie was linked with the vacant manager's position at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] following the dismissal of [[Martin Allen (footballer)|Martin Allen]]. Coventry City dismissed claims that an approach was made and that any approach would be "firmly rebuffed".<ref>{{cite news| title = Coventry deny Foxes' Dowie link| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/6979665.stm| website = BBC Sport| date = 5 September 2007| access-date =27 October 2007}}</ref> These rumours renewed again on 24 October when [[Gary Megson]] left Leicester to manage [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].
