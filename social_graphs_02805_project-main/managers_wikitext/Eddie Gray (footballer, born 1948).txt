'''Edwin''' '''Gray''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (born 17 January 1948) is a Scottish former [[association football|football]] player and coach. Gray was a [[winger (association football)|winger]], who was an integral member of the legendary [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] team of the 1960s and 1970s, later twice becoming the club's manager.

In 2000, Gray was voted as the third Greatest Leeds United player of all time, surpassed only by his club captain, Billy Bremner (No. 1) and John Charles (No. 2). He was also voted into the Greatest Leeds United team of all time. His two goals against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in 1970 feature in Leeds United's Greatest 100 goals – the second of which is widely regarded as the greatest Leeds United goal of all time and recently {{when?|date=June 2024}} featured in ''[[The Times]]'' as one of the five greatest ever goals. On 9 May 2013, Gray was also appointed as [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] football Ambassador. Gray was also inducted into the English Hall of Fame on 25 September 2013 at an awards evening in Manchester.

Gray played in 12 full international games for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] between 1969 and 1977. Besides his two stints with Leeds, Gray also managed [[Whitby Town F.C.|Whitby Town]], [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] during the 1980s.

He was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in the [[1983 Birthday Honours]].<ref>United Kingdom list: {{London Gazette |date=10 June 1983 |supp=y |issue=49375 |pages=13 }}</ref>

==Playing career==
Gray was born in [[Glasgow]] and brought up in the city's [[Castlemilk]] district.<ref name="mecca">[https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/interview-eddie-gray-why-sfa-must-stay-hampden-our-mecca-257663%3famp Interview: Eddie Gray on why SFA must stay at Hampden - 'our mecca'], The Scotsman, 18 September 2018</ref> He was a schoolboy international for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. He had aspirations of signing for his boyhood team [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], but signed professional forms with [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] at the age of 16. He made his first team debut on New Year's Day 1966, less than three weeks before his 18th birthday, and would go on to play for the club for almost 20 years. A winger in the classic mould, Gray was feted in world football for his ability to beat opposing full backs for skill, pace and thought. As the Leeds team grew in stature and experience through the 1960s, Gray became a vital component of the team.

In 1968, he was in the Leeds team which won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and the [[UEFA Cup|Fairs Cup]] double, scoring winning goals in both semi-finals, including a memorable individual goal against [[Brian Clough]]'s [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in the semi-final of the League Cup.<ref name=YOUEdd>{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVYrdkGzMnc |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/OVYrdkGzMnc |archive-date=21 December 2021 |url-status=live|title=Eddie Gray solo goal; Derby County| date=1 January 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref> However injury meant he missed the second leg of the Fairs Cup final.<ref>{{cite web |title=Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final Second Leg.|url=http://www.ozwhitelufc.net.au/11-09-1968%20Ferencvaros%20v%20LUFC.htm|website=ozwhitelufc.net.au |access-date=6 December 2020}}</ref> He was then an important part of the team that won [[Football League First Division|League championship]] a year later, making 33 appearances and scoring five goals, during a season in which United scored a record number of championship points and lost only two matches along the way to conquering the title. However it was in 1970 that he would make his most famous appearance in a Leeds shirt.

The team was chasing a unique "treble" of League championship, [[FA Cup]] and [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] with Gray in sparkling form. He had already scored what many fans of the club call the greatest goal ever by a Leeds player – a solo run past several [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] players which involved flicks and dragbacks as he somehow got to a shooting position from a position on the goal-line well to the left of the goal – when his day came at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] for the [[1970 FA Cup Final]] against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

Gray's marking full back was [[David Webb (footballer)|David Webb]], a steady but undistinguished defender whom, for the 90 minutes and extra-time period, Gray tormented. Webb was repeatedly left on his backside or looking the wrong way as Gray ghosted past him, including one run where he cut inside onto his 'weaker' right foot and crashed a shot against the crossbar. Though Leeds dominated the match, the game still ended 2–2 and a replay was required – Gray had taken the corner which had allowed [[Jack Charlton]] to open the scoring. In the replay, Chelsea changed tactics and put the more uncompromising [[Ron Harris (English footballer)|Ron Harris]] on to Gray and as a result, the danger was snuffed out – Harris badly injured Gray with a brutal tackle to the back of the knee. Chelsea won 2–1 and, in a final twist, it was Webb who scored the winner. Leeds lost the League championship race to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and the European Cup semi-final to Celtic, thereby ended with nothing.<ref name="mecca"/>

Gray's frequent battles with injury started, and he missed more than half of the 1970–71 season, during which Leeds again snatched League championship defeat from the jaws of victory but won the Fairs Cup for the second time against [[Juventus FC|Juventus]]. He found devastating form again for part of the 1971–72 season in which he was part of the team that destroyed [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] consecutively at [[Elland Road]], by scorelines of 5–1 and 7–0; the match footage of both games would become iconic. Later in the same season he featured in the team which won the [[1972 FA Cup Final]] against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and featured again in the [[1973 FA Cup Final|following cup final]] which Leeds surprisingly lost to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. He missed the controversial [[1973 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final]] defeat to [[A.C. Milan]], and missed most of the season in 1973–74 when Leeds won the League title again thanks to more injury woes. These injuries had become so frequent that when Brian Clough succeeded [[Don Revie]] at Leeds United, he began his first team meeting by stating that if Eddie Gray had been a horse, he would have been shot long ago.<ref name=WAFLL1>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20041128/ai_n12591693|title=Lousy football, wonderful fans; SPORTS DIARY | work=The Sunday Herald | first=Tom | last=Shields | date=28 November 2004}}</ref><ref name="mecca"/>

His performance on the wing earned the famous tribute from Revie that ''when he plays on snow, he doesn't leave any footprints''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eddie Gray |url=https://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/halloffame/eddie-gray/ |website=National Football Museum |access-date=16 September 2020}}</ref><ref name="mecca"/> Gray played in the team which reached the [[1975 European Cup Final]] in Paris, featuring in the home victory against the Spanish champions [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the semi-final, during which Gray tormented his marker de la Cruz and pushed Barcelona onto the back foot, allowing Leeds to dominate. However, he was left from the starting line up for the final by manager [[Jimmy Armfield]], which Leeds would go on to lose controversially to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. Also featuring in this campaign was his younger brother [[Frank Gray|Frank]], who had likewise come through the ranks at Elland Road.<ref name="mecca"/> This was the swansong of the great Don Revie team (Revie himself had left a year earlier to take over as England manager) and Gray's teammates started to leave the club. By the early 1980s, Gray was the only player from any part of the Revie era still at the club (although [[Peter Lorimer]] and [[David Harvey (footballer)|David Harvey]] would later make comebacks). Converted to left back, Gray prolonged his career and was in the side which was relegated under former teammate [[Allan Clarke (footballer)|Allan Clarke]] in 1982.

Gray's unfortunate injury record meant that his Scotland career was short and infrequent. He won just 12 [[cap (football)|caps]] and missed the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] through injury. In an era of hard men – Bremner, Harris, Smith, etc., Gray also had the distinction of never being booked in his career.<ref name="mecca"/>

==Managerial career==
Gray then took over as player-manager at Leeds in 1982, following their relegation from the First Division. The club had to turn to a youth policy to rebuild the team, with the emergence of players like [[John Sheridan (footballer)|John Sheridan]], [[Neil Aspin]], [[Denis Irwin]] and [[Scott Sellars]]. After top half finishes in his first two seasons in charge, the 1984–85 season saw a push for promotion that was lost on the final day at [[Birmingham City]]. Following failure to gain promotion from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], Gray ended association with Leeds after 20 years, 561 games and 68 goals.

He would later manage [[Whitby Town F.C.|Whitby Town]]. In 1986, Gray took over at [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and in the 1986–87 season the club managed an escape from near-certain relegation from the Football League.

Gray took over at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] for season 1988–89, following the departure of [[Brian Horton]] the previous season. Hull managed to pull into mid-table and only five points short of the play-offs in February, and they reached the FA Cup fifth round where they lost to Liverpool. Only 1 win in the last 18 games meant that Hull finished fourth from bottom, yet clear of relegation danger, but the poor form led to his departure.

==Return to Leeds==
Gray continued his long standing association with Leeds United by joining the club as a Youth Team coach. His work with the youth set-up nurtured a terrific generation of Leeds players such as [[Harry Kewell]], [[Ian Harte]], [[Alan Smith (footballer born 1980)|Alan Smith]] and [[Jonathan Woodgate]], who all went on to become first-team regulars. In 1997, Gray was promoted to Reserve Team Manager and the following year was made new manager [[David O'Leary]]'s assistant.

To the aggravation of Leeds supporters, Gray was forced to take a back step when [[Brian Kidd]] was promoted from Academy Manager to Head Coach and was given all coaching responsibilities. The fans made their support known for Gray through banners at matches, whilst at the same time verbally abusing Kidd.<ref name=bbckidd>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/1853253.stm|title=Who's Kidding who? | work=BBC News | date=4 March 2002 | access-date=3 January 2010}}</ref> Both Gray and Kidd were relieved of their duties in 2003 when new manager [[Peter Reid]] took the reins.

When Reid left Leeds in 2003, Gray was charged with the task of trying to preserve their [[FA Premier League]] status, something which, under immense pressure, he could not do. Gray was then given a one-year football consultancy role at the club before joining BBC Radio Leeds as a matchday analyst. In 2008, the BBC lost their rights to the live radio broadcast of Leeds matches; as a result, Gray left [[BBC Radio Leeds]] and moved to the club's official radio station, [[Yorkshire Radio]].

On 9 May 2013, Gray was appointed Football Ambassador at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and would also remain in his role as Yorkshire Radio Co-Commentator. He is currently co-commentator alongside Thom Kirwin for Leeds United's own TV and Radio Channel LUTV.
