'''John Matthew Deehan''' (born 6 August 1957) is an English former [[association football|football]] manager and player.

During his playing career he was a [[association football|footballer]] from 1975 until 1990 and is most well known for his spells as a striker for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]. He also played for [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. He was also capped seven times at [[England national under-21 football team|England U21]] level, scoring six goals.

Since retiring Deehan initially returned to Norwich as a coach and had a spell as manager during their 1994/95 [[Premier League]] campaign before later managing [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] to a [[Division Three]] title and a caretaker spell in charge of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. He has since held roles as the director of football of [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]], [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] and [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], as well as actively being part of the coaching staff at [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].

==Career==

===As a player===
Born in [[Solihull]], as a player Deehan was a striker who is best known for productive spells with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]. With Villa he was a member of the team that won the [[1977 Football League Cup Final]] against Everton and was a member of the Norwich sides which won the [[1985 Football League Cup Final]] and the Second Division championship in 1986. On 24 January 2012 he was appointed as Director of Football at League Two club [[Plymouth Argyle]]. Argyle stood at 22nd in League Two at the time of his appointment.

He was a competent goalscorer from an early age, breaking the 10-goal barrier in the league for three successive seasons by the age of 22.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=39423 |title=Football photographic encyclopedia |publisher=Sporting-heroes.net |access-date=2019-05-22}}</ref> He was initially less successful after leaving [[Villa Park]] in September 1979 to sign for Villa's local rivals West Bromwich Albion, managing just five goals from 47 league games over the next two years, but recaptured his form after joining Norwich City in December 1981 and helping them seal promotion to the First Division that season. He scored 20 league goals in his first [[1982–83 in English football|full season]] at [[Carrow Road]] and managed 15 and 13 goals over the next two seasons, although he was unable to save the Canaries from relegation in [[1984–85 in English football|1984–85]]. He also helped them win the [[Football League Cup]] in 1985 and the Second Division title - and a return to the First Division as Second Division champions a year later.

In 2002, Norwich fans voted Deehan into the [[Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his contribution as a player.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2007-09-27 |title=EDP24: Norwich City FC centenary |url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/Content/Sport/CanaryCentenary/HallofFame.asp |access-date=2025-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927172948/http://www.edp24.co.uk/Content/Sport/CanaryCentenary/HallofFame.asp |archive-date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>

In the summer of 1986, he left Norwich to join [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in a player exchange deal that saw [[Trevor Putney]] move to [[Carrow Road]]. His [[1985–86 in English football|final season]] at Norwich had seen him collected a [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title medal, but his form was less impressive than in previous seasons with just four goals from 26 league games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=39425 |title=Football photographic encyclopedia |publisher=Sporting-heroes.net |access-date=2019-05-22}}</ref>

From 1988 until 1990 he was player-coach at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], where he worked under the management of former Norwich assistant [[Mel Machin]], before returning to Norwich City as [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]]'s assistant in the summer of 1992.

===Management and Coaching===
He helped coach an unfancied Canaries side to a surprise third-place finish in the inaugural [[FA Premier League]] (season 1992–93), and was promoted to the manager's seat the following January when Walker moved to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. Norwich finished 12th in the Premiership in 1993-94 and started the following season reasonably well despite the (then) record English sale of [[Chris Sutton]] to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for £5 million. Despite the loss of Sutton, and the sale of [[Efan Ekoku]] shortly afterwards, the Canaries were seventh in the Premiership by Christmas and were in contention for a [[UEFA Cup]] place. An injury to goalkeeper [[Bryan Gunn]] then sparked a dramatic loss of form, and by the time the Canaries lost 3–0 to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 8 April 1995, they were heading for the relegation zone. Deehan then stepped down as manager and handed the reins to his assistant [[Gary Megson]], but Megson was unable to stave off relegation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ex-canaries.co.uk/players/deehan.htm |title=Flown From the Nest - John Deehan |publisher=Ex-canaries.co.uk |access-date=2019-05-22}}</ref>

Deehan's absence from football did not last long. He began the 1995–96 season as manager of [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in the [[Football League Third Division]], and after two seasons at the helm he guided them to the Division Three title and promotion to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]. After safeguarding Wigan's survival in 1997–98, he accepted the assistant manager's job at [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and for one season worked under [[Steve Bruce]]. Bruce's time at [[Bramall Lane]] was unsuccessful and Deehan resigned alongside him.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sutcliffe |first=Richard |title=Rebooted: When Steve Bruce quit Sheffield United – and almost the game |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/1768219/2020/05/17/rebooted-steve-bruce-quits-sheffield-united/ |access-date=2025-01-01 |work=The New York Times |date=17 May 2020 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

After leaving Sheffield United, Deehan worked again with Steve Bruce at Huddersfield Town, joining the club in the summer of 1999. Following Bruce's sacking in October 2000, Deehan remained at the McAlpine to work alongside [[Lou Macari]], who initially took over as caretaker manager and later became permanent manager. Deehan left in the summer of 2001 to join [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] as assistant manager to [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]] in July 2001.<ref>{{Cite news

He left the club when [[Graham Taylor (football manager)|Graham Taylor]] was named Villa manager for the second time.

In October 2003, Deehan became Director of Football at [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]], with [[Colin Calderwood]] working under him as team manager. The duo were appointed to get the team promoted from the league's basement division, and achieved this aim in the 2005–06 season. Both Calderwood and Deehan left the club at the end of the 2005–06 season, with Deehan moving to [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] as Director of Football. On 15 October 2007, it was confirmed that Deehan and Lincoln City manager [[John Schofield (football coach)|John Schofield]] had left the club.<ref>{{Cite news

In September 2008, Deehan expressed interest in the vacant manager's post at League Two side [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], saying: "I think Grimsby Town is a good club and a good opportunity for any manager. Whenever I've been to Blundell Park, I've been impressed with the set-up and the positive approach to football."<ref>{{Cite news

On 21 January 2009, he was appointed as Chief Scout of Norwich City Football Club in part of the new management team alongside three of his former players – [[Bryan Gunn]] as First Team Manager, [[Ian Crook]] as first team coach <ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&category=NewsSplash&tBrand=EDPOnline&tCategory=News&itemid=NOED21%20Jan%202009%2011%3A54%3A04%3A740 |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319095010/http://new.edp24.co.uk/content/news/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline |archive-date=19 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Ian Butterworth as Assistant Manager.

In December 2009, Deehan became [[Lee Harper]]'s assistant at [[Kettering Town]] but was controversially sacked later that month immediately following a 5–1 defeat to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in an FA Cup second-round replay where his choice of substitutions during extra time were blamed by Kettering owner Imraan Ladak for the defeat.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/dec/09/fa-cup-leeds-united-kettering-town|title= Kettering assistant John Deehan sacked after extra-time defeat at Leeds|last=Rae |first=Richard |date=9 December 2009 |work=The Guardian|access-date=18 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/k/kettering_town/8403165.stm|title= Lee Harper considers future as Kettering manager|date=9 December 2009|work=BBC Sport|access-date=18 December 2009}}</ref>

On 17 March 2010, he was announced as Head of Recruitment (Director of Football) at [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in order to work with manager [[Neil Woods]] and his assistant [[Chris Casper]]. It was touted that Deeham would be a possible replacement for Woods if the club are relegated from the Football League. However, after the conclusion of the 09/10 season, which eventually brought relegation, Deehan's contract was not renewed and he left the club 20 May 2010.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2012-01-25 |title=John Deehan appointed Plymouth Argyle director of football |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16716110 |access-date=2025-01-01 |work=BBC Sport |language=en-GB}}</ref>

On 25 January 2012, Deehan was appointed Director of Football at [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]]. At the end of the 2012–2013 season he left the club. He teamed up with Stuart Gray again early in 2014, joining the coaching staff at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C|Sheffield Wednesday]]. He left the club in June 2015 after Gray's dismissal.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sport |first=PA |date=12 June 2015 |title=Deehan next to leave Owls |url=https://www.tntsports.co.uk/football/deehan-next-to-leave-owls_sto4780149/story.shtml |access-date=1 January 2025 |website=TNT Sports}}</ref>
