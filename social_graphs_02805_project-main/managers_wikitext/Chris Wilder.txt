'''Christopher John Wilder''' (born 23 September 1967) is an English professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] who formerly [[Football player|played]] as a [[right-back]]. He is the manager of {{English football updater|SheffieU}} club [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].

Wilder's extensive professional playing career saw spells at Sheffield United (twice), [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] and [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]]. He also had loan spells at five clubs.

After retiring, he became a manager and was in charge of [[Alfreton Town F.C.|Alfreton Town]], Halifax Town (their last manager before liquidation), [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]], Sheffield United, [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and Watford. He won promotion from the [[Conference Premier]] with Oxford via the play-offs in 2010, from [[EFL League Two|League Two]] as champions with Northampton in 2016, from [[EFL League One|League One]] with Sheffield United as champions in 2017, and from the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] with the same club two years later.

==Early life==
Christopher John Wilder was born on 23 September 1967 in [[Stocksbridge]], West Riding of Yorkshire (now South Yorkshire).<ref name="Hugman"/>

==Playing career==
Wilder started his football career as a trainee at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and was released without making it into the first team.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last1= Holley |first1= Duncan |last2= Chalk |first2= Gary | publisher=Hagiology Publishing | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-9534474-3-5|page=615}}</ref>

He moved on to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in August 1986. In December 1987, defender Wilder was sent off for a crude tackle on Millwall's [[Jimmy Carter (footballer)|Jimmy Carter]] [[1987-88 English football season#Second Division|in a season]] which saw the Sheffield club relegated to the third division.<ref>''Millwall advance their Christmas goal rush'', [[The Times]], 29 December 1987</ref> The following season Wilder was on the receiving end, being elbowed in the face. Swansea's [[Bryan Wade]] received a three match ban for [[violent conduct]] as a result.<ref>Taylor, Louise. ''Clubs face fines for sending weakened sides to tournament'', The Times, 13 December 1988</ref> Wilder was a regular in the team that finished second and therefore clinched promotion back to the second division at the first attempt in the [[1988–89 in English football#Third Division|1988–89 season]], and was also part of the squad that gained a further promotion the season after, this time back to the first division, after an absence of fourteen years. Wilder was a regular during the following season back in the first division, but thereafter found appearances harder to come by, hence Wilder left for nearby [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] in 1992, staying for a further four years and amassing his largest number of games and goals for one club.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=8503|title=Chris Wilder &#124; Football Stats &#124; No Club &#124; Age 54 &#124; 1985-2001 &#124; Soccer Base}}</ref>

In 1998, Wilder returned to Sheffield United, and a year later he was brought to [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] by [[Micky Adams]] before joining Halifax Town that same year.<ref name="ENFA">{{ENFA}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
===Alfreton Town===
Wilder began his career in management at [[Alfreton Town F.C.|Alfreton Town]]. He took over at the club in late October 2001 and in the 27 weeks he was in charge won four trophies: the Northern Counties (East) League Premier Division, the League Cup, the President's Cup and the Derbyshire Senior Cup.

===Halifax Town===
Wilder returned to [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] as manager on 2 July 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wilder quits for Halifax |url=http://www.derbyshiretimes.co.uk/sport/wilder-quits-for-halifax-1-470718 |newspaper=Derbyshire Times |date=4 July 2002 |access-date=22 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Alfreton Town Football Club History|url = http://www.alfretontownfc.com/history0405.htm|publisher = Alfreton Town F.C.|access-date = 9 June 2010|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100611220932/http://www.alfretontownfc.com/history0405.htm|archive-date = 11 June 2010|url-status = dead}}</ref> He replaced [[caretaker manager]] [[Neil Redfearn]], who had in turn replaced [[Alan Little (footballer)|Alan Little]] (who left on 8 April after falling ill with appendicitis in March). Halifax had been relegated to the Conference at the end of the season.

Wilder was in charge at Halifax for more than 300 games until the club went into liquidation on 30 June 2008, and he decided to join former Halifax defender [[Alan Knill]], as the assistant manager of [[Bury F.C.|Bury]].<ref>{{cite news |url= https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/bury/7481362.stm |title=Wilder leaves Halifax for Shakers |date=30 June 2008 |access-date= 1 July 2008 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

===Oxford United===
After fewer than six months at [[Gigg Lane]], Wilder was appointed as the manager of [[National League (division)|Conference National]] club [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] on 21 December 2008<ref>{{cite news |url= https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/o/oxford_utd/7790788.stm |title=Wilder is new Oxford United boss |date=21 December 2008 |access-date=21 December 2008 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> (replacing [[Jim Smith (footballer, born 1940)|Jim Smith]] who had been caretaker  manager in the wake of [[Darren Patterson]]'s dismissal), where he only just missed out on a play-off place in his first season. Wilder's first full season in charge of Oxford began successfully and by mid-season they were top of the Conference table by five points with a game in hand. However, Oxford were overtaken by [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]], who would go on to win the title and take the automatic promotion place, consigning the Us to the playoffs with [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], [[Rushden & Diamonds F.C.|Rushden & Diamonds]] and [[York City F.C.|York City]]. They defeated Rushden & Diamonds to reach the play-off final, and gained promotion to the [[English Football League|Football League]] by beating York City 3–1.<ref name="2010POF">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_conf/8673190.stm |title=Oxford United 3–1 York City |date=16 May 2010 |access-date=22 July 2024 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

In their first season back in the Football League in four years, Wilder guided Oxford to mid-table safety. The team finished 12th, in the top half of the table, their highest finish in seven years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/13247258|title=Shrewsbury 3–0 Oxford Utd |date=8 May 2011 |access-date=8 May 2011 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> The next season Oxford finished ninth, after poor form late in the season led to the team dropping out of the play-off position they had occupied for most of the year.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17878372|title=Port Vale 3–0 Oxford Utd |date=5 May 2012 |access-date=13 May 2011 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> Oxford's chairman Kelvin Thomas gave Wilder his backing, meaning he would remain manager for the [[2012–13 Football League Two|2012–13 season]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/sport/oxfordunited/usnews/9702450.Thomas_pinning_faith_in_Oxford_United_boss_Wilder/ |title=Thomas pinning faith in Oxford United boss Wilder |date=12 May 2012 |access-date=4 October 2018 |work=Oxford Mail}}</ref> Despite failing to achieve a play-off place again in Oxford's third season back in the League, and intense speculation about his future at the club, Wilder was offered and accepted a further one-year contract for the [[2013–14 Football League Two|2013–14 season]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22292993 |title=Chris Wilder signs new Oxford United deal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 April 2013 |access-date=25 April 2013}}</ref>

On 26 January 2014 he resigned as Oxford manager with the intention of joining League Two rivals Northampton Town as their manager.<ref>{{cite news |title=Oxford United accept manager Chris Wilder's resignation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25878977 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 January 2014 |access-date=22 January 2016}}</ref>

===Northampton Town===
On 27 January 2014, Wilder was appointed manager of [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]], signing a three-and-a-half-year contract. Wilder successfully battled against relegation to the Conference, after taking over the club in the relegation zone in League 2.<ref>{{cite web|title = Chris Wilder appointed new manager |url=http://www.ntfc.co.uk/news/article/wilder-appointed-1318363.aspx |publisher=Northampton Town F.C. |access-date=27 January 2014}}</ref> He led the side to a mid-table finish in the 2014–15 season, and then to the [[EFL League Two|League Two]] title the following season with 99 points,<ref>{{cite web|title=Northampton Town FC History|url=http://www.ntfc.co.uk/club/history/|publisher=Northampton Town F.C.|access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref> despite significant financial difficulties at the club resulting in players and staff not being paid during October and November 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35000760|title=Northampton Town players and staff paid after Thomas takeover |publisher= BBC Sport|date=3 December 2015|access-date=12 January 2020}}</ref>

===Sheffield United===
On 12 May 2016, Wilder joined his boyhood club Sheffield United as their new manager on a three-year contract, following the parting of company with [[Nigel Adkins]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Blades appoint Wilder as new manager|url=http://www.sufc.co.uk/news/article/sheffield-united-chris-wilder-3110596.aspx|publisher=Sheffield United F.C.|access-date=13 May 2016|date=12 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Chris Wilder: Sheffield United appoint Northampton boss to replace Nigel Adkins|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36274419|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=15 May 2016|date=12 May 2016}}</ref> In the pre-season, despite little financial backing, he was able to bring some new players in, many of which were free transfers. He then made Sheffield born [[Billy Sharp]] club captain. However, Wilder's League One managerial debut got off to a poor start, only gaining a single point from the first four games, which left Sheffield United at the bottom of League One.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37067537|title=Millwall 2 v Sheffield Utd. 1 : Match Report|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=26 April 2019}}</ref> Despite this, the club pushed on and went on to become League One Champions, securing 100 points in the process, a club record.<ref name="Up the Champions">{{cite journal|last1=Kirkham|first1=Andrew|title=Up the Champions|journal=The Official Matchday Programme of Sheffield United F.C. Souvenir Special|date=30 April 2017|volume=v Chesterfield}}</ref>

His second season was full of highs and few lows. His managerial Championship debut against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] ended in a 1–0 win for Sheffield United.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40760770|title=Sheffield Utd. 1 v Brentford 0 : Match Report|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=26 April 2019}}</ref> Then in September 2017, United beat [[Steel City derby|city rivals]] [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] 4–2 at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41297178|title=Sheffield Wednesday 2 v.

By the end of October, after beating local rivals [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] 2–1 at [[Elland Road]], Sheffield United were top of the Championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41689697|title=Leeds Utd. 1 v Sheffield Utd. 2 : Match Report|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=26 April 2019}}</ref>

On 28 April 2019, it was confirmed that Wilder had led the Blades to the Premier League following nearest rival Leeds' 1–1 draw at home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11683/11706107/sheffield-united-promoted-to-the-premier-league|title=Sheffield United promoted to the Premier League|website=Sky Sports|language=en|access-date=28 April 2019}}</ref> This ensured his second promotion in just three years at the club.

===Return to Sheffield United===
On 5 December 2023, [[Paul Heckingbottom]] was dismissed by Sheffield United after a 5–0 loss to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] that left the club at the bottom of the [[Premier League]].

After a 3–2 loss to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 30 January 2024, Wilder criticised referee [[Tony Harrington]]'s performance, calling it "ridiculous" and pointing to decisions made against Sheffield United during the game.
