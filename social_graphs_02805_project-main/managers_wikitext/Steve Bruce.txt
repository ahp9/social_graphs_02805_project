'''Stephen Roger Bruce''' (born 31 December 1960) is an English professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Association football|player]] who was a [[centre-back]] in a twenty-year playing career. He was most recently the head coach of [[EFL League One]] club [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]].

Born in [[Corbridge]], Northumberland, Bruce was a promising schoolboy footballer but was rejected by several professional clubs. He was on the verge of quitting the game altogether when he was offered a trial with [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]. He was offered an apprenticeship and went on to play more than 200&nbsp;games for the club before joining [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 1984, winning the [[1985 Football League Cup Final|League Cup in 1985]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], with whom he achieved great success, winning twelve trophies including three [[Premier League]] titles, three [[FA Cup]]s, one [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]. He also became the first English player of the 20th century to captain a team to [[Double (association football)|the Double]]. Despite his success on the field, he was never selected to play for the [[England national football team|England national team]]. Commentators and contemporaries have described him as one of the best English players of the 1980s and 1990s never to play for his country at full international level.

Bruce began his managerial career with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], and spent short periods of time managing [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] before joining [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in 2001. He twice led Birmingham to [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Premier League during his tenure of nearly six years, but resigned in 2007 to begin a second spell as manager of Wigan. At the end of the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09 season]], he resigned to take over as manager of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], a post he held until he was dismissed in November 2011. Seven months later, he was appointed manager of [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and led the club to two promotions to the Premier League, as well as the [[2014 FA Cup Final]], before leaving in July 2016. He took over at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] four months later but was dismissed in October 2018. He became manager of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in February 2019, and left in July that year to take over at Newcastle United. He managed the club through the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], keeping them in the Premier League, and left in November 2021 following the club's takeover by the [[Public Investment Fund]]. His final match in charge was his 1,000th in club management. In February 2022, Bruce took over as manager of West Bromwich Albion but was dismissed in October of the same year due to a poor start to the 2022–23 season.  He was appointed head coach of Blackpool in September 2024 but was later sacked in October 2025.

Bruce, a boyhood fan of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], said that he sneaked into [[St James' Park]] without paying to watch the team play, saying "I have always been a Newcastle lad and when I was a kid, I crawled under the turnstiles to get in to try and save a [[Shilling|bob]] or whatever it was.

Having been turned down by several professional clubs, including Newcastle United, [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Southport F.C.|Southport]], Bruce was about to start work as an apprentice plumber at the [[Swan Hunter]] dockyard when he was offered a trial by [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] club [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], whose manager [[Gerry Summers]] had seen him playing for Wallsend in an international youth tournament.<ref name="SB39">Bruce (1994), pp. 39–40.</ref> He travelled down to [[Kent]] with [[Peter Beardsley]], another player from the Wallsend club, but although Gillingham signed Bruce as an apprentice, they turned Beardsley away.<ref name="Buster2" /> At the time, Bruce was playing as a [[midfielder]], but he was switched to the centre of defence by the head of Gillingham's youth scheme, [[Bill Collins (footballer, born 1920)|Bill Collins]], whom Bruce cites as the single biggest influence on his career.<ref name="Buster2">{{cite web |first=Haydn |last=Parry |title=Past Players: Steve Bruce |url=http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/PastPlayersDetail/0,,10416~63313,00.html |publisher=[[Gillingham F.C.]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503105625/http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/PastPlayersDetail/0%2C%2C10416~63313%2C00.html |archive-date=3 May 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Buster">{{cite news |title=Adams and Bruce were Buster's premier pupils |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2004/03/07/sfnpb207.xml |date=6 March 2004 |first=Patrick |last=Barclay |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118132027/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fsport%2F2004%2F03%2F07%2Fsfnpb207.xml |archive-date=18 November 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Playing career==
===Gillingham===
[[File:Priestfield1.jpg|thumb|[[Priestfield Stadium]], home of [[Gillingham F.C.]], where Bruce began his playing career]]

Bruce spent the [[1978–79 in English football|1978–79 season]] in Gillingham's [[Reserve team (association football)|reserve team]] and, despite playing in defence, scored 18&nbsp;goals to finish the season as top scorer.<ref name="triggs">Triggs (2001), p. 70.</ref> In January 1979, he was selected to represent the [[England national under-18 football team|England youth]] team, and he went on to gain eight caps, participating in the [[1980 UEFA European Under-18 Championship]].<ref name="SB52">Bruce (1994), pp. 52–53.</ref> He came close to making his debut for the club's senior team in May 1979, but Summers decided at the last minute that, as Gillingham were chasing [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] from the Third Division, Bruce was not yet ready to handle the pressure of the occasion.<ref name="SB53">Bruce (1994), p. 53.</ref> He eventually made his senior debut in a [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] tie against [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] on 11 August 1979,<ref name="First season" /> and made an immediate impact in the team, winning the club's Player of the Year award at the end of the [[1979–80 in English football|1979–80 season]].<ref name="SB57">Bruce (1994), p. 57.</ref> He went on to make more than 200&nbsp;appearances for the club,<ref name="triggs"/> and was twice voted into the [[Professional Footballers' Association]]'s Third Division Team of the Year.<ref name="triggs352">Triggs (2001), p. 352.</ref>

Confident that he was being targeted by clubs from higher divisions, Bruce resolved not to sign a new contract with Gillingham when his existing deal expired at the end of the [[1983–84 in English football|1983–84 season]].<ref name="SB60">Bruce (1994), p. 60.</ref> In an April 1983 match against [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], he attempted, in a moment of anger, to deliberately injure opposition player [[Tommy Tynan]], but connected awkwardly and succeeded only in breaking his own leg, leaving him unable to play again for six months.<ref name="SB62">Bruce (1994), p. 62.</ref> He returned in time to play a key role in Gillingham achieving two draws against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[FA Cup]] in 1984, attracting the attention once again of [[Scout (association football)|scouts]] from [[Football League First Division|First Division]] clubs.<ref name="Buster2" /> [[Arthur Cox (footballer)|Arthur Cox]], manager of Bruce's beloved Newcastle United, expressed an interest in signing the player, but resigned from his job before any further action could be taken.<ref name="SB65">Bruce (1994), p. 65.</ref> Bruce eventually opted to sign for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in August 1984 for a fee variously reported as £125,000<ref name="sang">{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?season_id=114&team_id=1855&teamTabs=transfers&season_id=114 |title=Transfers: 1984/85 |work=Soccerbase |publisher=Centurycomm |access-date=4 January 2016}}</ref> or £135,000.<ref name="triggs" /> In 2009, he was voted into Gillingham's Hall of Fame.<ref name="GFCHOFR">{{cite web |url=http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10416~1725855,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202174319/http://www.gillinghamfootballclub.com/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10416~1725855%2C00.html |archive-date=2 December 2009 |title=GFC Hall of Fame Winners |publisher=Gillingham F.C. |date=18 July 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

At the height of his success with United, Bruce was contacted by [[Jack Charlton]], manager of the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]], who had discovered that, due to his mother's place of birth, Bruce was eligible to play for Ireland. Bruce states in his autobiography that further investigation revealed that, while his earlier appearance for England B in a [[Friendly (association football)|friendly]] was not an issue, his appearances for the England Youth team in a [[UEFA]]-sanctioned tournament prohibited him from playing for the senior team of another country.<ref name="SB89">Bruce (1994), p. 89.</ref> He has subsequently claimed that he chose not to play for Ireland as it would have caused problems for his club at a time when UEFA restricted the number of foreign players that a club could have in their squad in its competitions.<ref name="Ireland" />

United dominated English football in the [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94 season]], winning a second consecutive Premier League title and then defeating Chelsea in the [[1994 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] to become only the fourth team, and Bruce the first English captain, to win [[Double (association football)|the Double]] in the 20th century,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F924217D546CF4E&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 |title=United worthy of place among elite – FA Cup |newspaper=The Times |location=London |first=Rob |last=Hughes |date=16 May 1994 |access-date=6 January 2016}}</ref><ref>The other 20th-century Double-winning captains were [[Dave Mackay]] and [[Alan Hansen]], both from Scotland, and [[Danny Blanchflower]] from Northern Ireland.</ref><ref name="SB1">Bruce (1994), p. 1.</ref> The [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95 season]] was a disappointing one for Bruce and United, as the club failed in its bid to win a third consecutive Premier League title and lost to Everton in the [[1995 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F9247A0E0BFBA03&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 |title=Everton's Royle revival crowned by Rideout – Football |newspaper=The Times |location=London |first=Rob |last=Hughes |date=22 May 1995 |access-date=6 January 2016}}</ref>

==Style of play==
During the early part of his career, Bruce's sometimes over-enthusiastic playing style, which he later described as "rampaging",<ref name="Buster2" /> caused him disciplinary problems. He later developed into a solid and dependable all-round player, characterised as "an honest trier who made the absolute most of limited natural ability".<ref name="IP">Ponting (2000), p. 177.</ref> In his prime, he was particularly noted for his calm and deliberate passing of the ball, and his ability to control it under pressure, often with his chest. At the time, [[Mark Wright (footballer, born 1963)|Mark Wright]] of Liverpool was said to be the only other centre-back able to match Bruce's level of skill in these areas.<ref name="recovery" />

Bruce was also known for his unusually high goalscoring rate for a [[centre-back]], resulting from a combination of his ability to powerfully head the ball and his effectiveness in taking [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.setanta.com/Templates/News/NewsArticle.aspx?id=8896&epslanguage=EN |publisher=[[Setanta Sports]] |title=The XI at 11: Goalscoring centre backs |first=Adam |last=Marshall |date=2 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192952/http://www.setanta.com/Templates/News/NewsArticle.aspx?id=8896&epslanguage=EN |archive-date=3 March 2016}}</ref> Although lacking poise and grace,<ref name="IP" /> and often criticised for his lack of pace,<ref name="IP" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F924308782B4AB3&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 |newspaper=The Times |location=London |title=Cantona key to United's ignition – Football |first=Rob |last=Hughes |date=23 November 1994 |access-date=6 January 2016}}</ref> his bravery and willingness to take knocks from opposition players made him the "heart" of the defence during his time with Manchester United.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/vidic-succeeds-as-king-bruce-1004983 |newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]] |title=Vidic succeeds as king Bruce |first=Mike |last=Whalley |date=22 September 2007 |access-date=5 January 2016}}</ref> He was well known for continuing to play even when injured,<ref name="IP" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/story/sport/qlkfsnmhql/rss2/ |newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]] |location=Cork |title=Masked ball for 50 in-a-row 'Killer' |first=Liam |last=Mackey |date=10 September 2008 |access-date=5 January 2016 |quote=But Steve Bruce – I think he played with 20 broken bones!}}</ref> including returning to the United team at short notice in 1992 even though he was awaiting an operation on a hernia.<ref name="recovery" /> His indomitable spirit and motivational abilities were deemed vital to the United team,<ref name="IP" /> and Alex Ferguson has commented on his "determination and heart".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/657/703/index.html |publisher=FIFA |title=Fergie compares captain Rooney to greats |date=11 December 2007 |access-date=5 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107075527/http://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/657/703/index.html |archive-date=7 January 2016}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
===Early managerial career===
In his first season as a manager, Bruce guided Sheffield United to eighth place in the First Division, nine points away from a place in the play-offs.<ref>{{cite web |title=England 1998/99 |url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablese/eng99.html |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |date=20 December 1999 |access-date=6 September 2008}}</ref> He caused controversy when he attempted to take his team off the pitch during an FA Cup match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].
