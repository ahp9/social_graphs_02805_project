==Managerial career==
[[File:Jacques Santini (en 1976).jpg|thumb|upright|Santini with [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]] in 1976]]

Santini is one of the most accomplished football managers in France.  Together with Jean Michel Aulas and Bernard Lacombe he was involved in the transformation of Lyon into a French football giant.  From 1997 to 2000 he was Sports' director, helping lay the foundation which resulted in Lyon becoming the best football club in France.  As manager of Lyon from 2000 to 2002 he was winner of French League Cup in 2001, and in 2002 he won the French Championship.

Santini was chosen as "The best French coach" in 2002 by France Football and World's The Best National Coach of the Year in 2003 by International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS)
Santini replaced [[Roger Lemerre]] as [[France national football team|France]] manager in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jul/19/newsstory.sport4|title=Lyon's Santini named as new French coach|date=2002-07-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2009-05-21 | location=London}}</ref>
He had already resigned from the position before [[2004 European Football Championship|Euro 2004]], where France surprisingly lost to eventual champions [[Greece national football team|Greece]] in the quarter-final.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/internationals/jacques-santini-of-france-exit-the-coach--but-will-he-head-for-tottenham-as-a-champion-731237.html|title=Jacques Santini of France: Exit the coach - but will he head for Tottenham as a champion?|date=2004-06-06|work=The Independent|access-date=2009-05-21 | location=London | first=Alex | last=Hayes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2004/3830575.stm|title=France 0-1 Greece |date=2004-06-25|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2009-05-21}}</ref>

Santini took the managerial position at [[Premier League]] club Tottenham Hotspur after Euro 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/3774655.stm|title=Spurs appoint Santini|date=2004-06-03|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2009-05-21}}</ref>
He surprisingly announced his resignation after just 13 games.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/spurs-in-turmoil-as-santini-walks-out-532191.html|title=Spurs in turmoil as Santini walks out|date=2004-11-06|work=The Independent|access-date=2009-05-21 | location=London}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Officially, Santini left England due to personal problems, but it was widely reported that a series of disagreements with then [[Director of Football|Sporting Director]] [[Frank Arnesen]] led to his departure.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2389587/Santini-quits-Spurs-after-power-struggle.html|title=Santini quits Spurs after power struggle|date=2004-11-06|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2009-05-21 | location=London | first=Mihir | last=Bose}}</ref>
Speaking in 2005, Santini said he quit partly because he felt agreements with the club were broken, but he admitted he "dug his own grave" by agreeing to join the club before the end of Euro 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4281847.stm|title=Bitter Santini hits out at Spurs |date=2005-02-20|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2009-05-21}}</ref>

He took the job of [[head coach]] of [[AJ Auxerre]] in [[Ligue 1]] in 2005, but was sacked in 2006 due to his conflict with vice-president of Auxerre [[Guy Roux]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4071340.stm|title=Auxerre name Santini as new coach|date=2005-06-07|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2009-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SPORT/football/05/17/story.santini/index.html?section=cnn_latest|title=Coach Santini is sacked by Auxerre|date=2006-05-17|work=CNN.com|access-date=2009-05-21}}</ref>

On 23 June 2008, Santini was linked with the vacant managerial position at [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] but he refused the offer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3726814,00.html|title=Santini keen on Hearts|date=2008-06-23|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2009-05-21}}</ref>
