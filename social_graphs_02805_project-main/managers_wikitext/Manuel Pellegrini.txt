'''Manuel Luis Pellegrini Ripamonti''' ({{IPA|es|maˈnwel peleˈɣɾini}}; {{IPA|it|pelleˈɡriːni|lang}};<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dipionline.it/dizionario/ricerca?lemma=Pellegrini|title=Pellegrini|work=DiPI Online|author=Luciano Canepari|author-link=Luciano Canepari|access-date=27 October 2018|language=it}}</ref> born 16 September 1953) is a Chilean professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Football player|player]] who is the head coach of [[Real Betis]]. As a coach, he has managed clubs in Spain, England, Argentina, Chile, China, and Ecuador. Pellegrini has won national leagues in four countries.

Pellegrini moved to Europe in 2004 to take the manager's post at Spanish side [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]]. Under Pellegrini, Villarreal achieved a third-place finish in [[La Liga]] in [[2004–05 La Liga|2004–05]], a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League knockout stage#Semi-finals|semi-final]] in [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League|2005–06]], and broke the big two in [[2007–08 La Liga|2008]] with a second-place finish in La Liga in [[2007–08 La Liga|2007–08]].

Pellegrini's consistent record at [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] attracted the attention of [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] and he was appointed manager there in 2009. He amassed a total of 96 points, a club record until it was surpassed by [[José Mourinho]] in the [[2011–12 Real Madrid C.F. season|2011–12 season]], but lost the title to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] by three points. He was dismissed after one season and later lamented the ''[[Galácticos]]'' policy employed at Real, which prevented him from building a balanced team.

Pellegrini took up the manager's role at [[Málaga CF|Málaga]] in November 2010. He led Málaga to a fourth-place finish in his first full season and to qualification for the [[UEFA Champions League]]. He made it to the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League knockout phase#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]] of the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League|2012–13 Champions League]], becoming the only coach to take two teams to the Champions League quarter-finals in their debut seasons in the competition. On 22 May 2013, Pellegrini confirmed he would leave Málaga at the end of the [[2012–13 La Liga]] season. On 14 June 2013, he was appointed manager of Manchester City,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/14/manuel-pellegrini-manchester-city-manager | location=London | newspaper=The Guardian | first=Andy | last=Hunter | title=Manuel Pellegrini confirmed as Manchester City manager | date=14 June 2013}}</ref> and won the [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] and [[2013–14 Premier League|Premier League]] in his first season as manager, in the process becoming the first manager from outside Europe to manage a team to the English Premier League title. The title winning season was also noted for goal scoring prowess, with Manchester City scoring 151 goals in all competitions – an English football record.<ref>{{cite news |title=Manchester City need two more goals to erase United's record feat of 143 goals during Busby Babes days |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/10772589/Manchester-City-need-two-more-goals-to-erase-Uniteds-record-feat-of-143-goals-during-Busby-Babes-days.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/10772589/Manchester-City-need-two-more-goals-to-erase-Uniteds-record-feat-of-143-goals-during-Busby-Babes-days.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=17 April 2014 |access-date=3 February 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Pellegrini also managed to take Manchester City to their first ever semi-final in Champions League in 2015–16, which was his last season, after finishing in fourth-place with 66 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36126021|title=Manchester City failed to reach their first Champions League final after an uninspiring semi-final second-leg display at 10-time winners Real Madrid|work=BBC Sport|date=4 May 2016|access-date=10 April 2019}}</ref> He managed [[Hebei China Fortune F.C.|Hebei China Fortune]] from 2016 to 2018 before leaving the position in May.

==Playing career==
Born in [[Santiago]],<ref name=BDFutbol/> to Italian parents, Pellegrini attended the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] in Santiago,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/detalle/detallenoticias.asp?idnoticia=363322 |title=Pellegrini no para: Ahora es elegido ex alumno distinguido de la PUC |publisher=Emol.com |date=17 June 2009 |access-date=15 December 2013}}</ref> where he graduated in civil engineering in 1979. He started his formative years as a footballer in the youth divisions of [[Audax Italiano]]. Then he went to [[Club Universidad de Chile]] where he would play professionally for them as a defender. He spent his entire playing career with the club, making a total of 451 appearances and scoring seven goals in the [[Chilean Primera División|Chilean Division 1]], including one goal against [[Colo-Colo]], Universidad de Chile's biggest rival.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

In the 1970s, Club Universidad de Chile was going through one of the most unsuccessful periods in its history, having not won the national [[Copa Chile]] championship since 1969. That changed in 1979, when the club managed to win the championship and secure a spot for the [[1980 Copa Libertadores]], defeating its arch-rival Colo-Colo in both tournaments.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Pellegrini was capped once by the [[Chile national football team|Chile national team]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.worldfootball.net/person/pe28825/manuel-pellegrini/international-matches/ |title=Manuel Pellegrini: Internationals |website=WorldFootball.net |publisher=HEIM:SPIEL |access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref> starting in a 1–1 friendly draw away to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on 7 May 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/brazil-v-chile-07-may-1986-239849/ |title=Brazil v Chile, 07 May 1986 |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref> He retired as a player a year later, in February 1987, after a match against [[Trasandino]], with his reason for retiring being the following: "We were playing in the [[Copa Chile]] against Trasandino. Our goalkeeper parried the shot of a rival player, I jumped to clear the ball, and behind me came a 17-year-old boy who jumped half a metre above me, and scored. That day I decided I couldn't keep going".<ref>{{Cite web|date=1 June 2009|title=El día que Iván Zamorano gatilló el retiro del fútbol de Pellegrini|url=https://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/2009/06/01/360785/el-dia-que-ivan-zamorano-gatillo-el-retiro-del-futbol-de-pellegrini.html|access-date=30 November 2020|website=Emol|language=es}}</ref> That boy was [[Iván Zamorano]], on loan from [[C.D. Cobresal|Cobresal]], who would eventually become ''[[Pichichi Trophy|Pichichi]]'' of La Liga in [[1994–95 La Liga|1995]] with Real Madrid. Pellegrini confessed: "If I had known where that boy would get, I would not have retired. I would have kept playing two more years."<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2009/06/01/mas_futbol/1243807241_850215.html|title=Pellegrini, el hombre al que retiró Zamorano|publisher=Diario AS|language=es|date=1 June 2009}}</ref>

Pellegrini wanted to help reconstruction projects in the [[Zona Central, Chile|Chilean central zone]] after the [[1985 Algarrobo earthquake]] knowing that his experience as a qualified civil engineer would be ideal.<ref>[http://deportes.elpais.com/deportes/2012/11/11/actualidad/1352662224_120971.html Qué tipo raro, Pellegrini] ''El País''.

==Managerial career==
===Early years===
As a coach, Pellegrini has primarily managed teams in Spain, Argentina and Chile.<ref>[http://www.thisischile.cl/1245/2/manuel-pellegrini/News.aspx The silent forging of success, Manuel Pellegrini] www.thisischile.cl 29 July 2009. Retrieved 11 August 2013</ref> As in his career as a professional player, he also started off coaching Universidad de Chile during the 1988 season, but left the team at the middle of the season to take football coaching courses in Europe.<ref name="sanchez">{{cite web |last1=Sánchez Leiva |first1=Jorge |title=Manuel Pellegrini repasa su fracaso más grande como entrenador: “Lo de la U fue un poquito de pecado de soberbia” |url=https://www.latercera.com/el-deportivo/noticia/manuel-pellegrini-repasa-su-fracaso-mas-grande-como-entrenador-lo-de-la-u-fue-un-poquito-de-pecado-de-soberbia/7MEN7L3FOJCTNL4OUKUNUY74DY/ |website=[[La Tercera]] |access-date=5 July 2025 |language=es |date=30 August 2024}}</ref>

The team's poor performance that year led to a [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] to the [[Chilean Primera División B|Division 2]] for the first time in its history,<ref name="sanchez"/> though in 1989 they won the Division 2 championship, bringing them back to Division 1, where they have remained ever since.

In 1990, [[Arturo Salah]] was appointed as the manager of the [[Chile national football team|Chile national team]], and he hired Pellegrini as his assistant coach and manager of the [[Chile national under-20 football team|under-20 team]].<ref>{{cite web |title=El metodo Pellegrini |url=https://www.latercera.com/noticia/el-metodo-pellegrini/ |website=[[La Tercera]] |access-date=5 July 2025 |language=es |date=5 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Detalles de la relación entre Eduardo Bonvallet y Manuel Pellegrini |url=https://www.lacuarta.com/deportes/noticia/detalles-de-la-relacion-entre-eduardo-bonvallet-y-manuel-pellegrini/71751/ |website=[[La Cuarta]] |access-date=5 July 2025 |language=es |date=18 September 2015 |quote=cuando Arturo Salah y Manuel Pellegrini, como ayudante, tomaron la selección chilena de cara a la Copa América de 1991.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Reyes |first1=Luis |title=Héctor Robles y su desastre en la Roja: una victoria en 13 partidos |url=https://chile.as.com/chile/2019/01/20/futbol/1547998974_340846.html |website=[[Diario AS]] |access-date=5 July 2025 |language=es |date=20 January 2019 |quote=el Sudamericano jugado en Venezuela en 1991. Ese equipo era dirigido por Manuel Pellegrini }}</ref> In 1990, Pellegrini was appointed manager of [[C.D. Palestino|Palestino]], where he stayed until 1992. Then, in 1992, he took on managership of [[C.D. O'Higgins|O'Higgins]] for a year, before moving in 1993 to become coach of [[Club Deportivo Universidad Católica|Universidad Católica]], one of the most popular clubs in Chile. There he managed well-known players such as [[Alberto Acosta]] and [[Nestor Gorosito]] and took the team to victory in the prestigious [[Copa Interamericana]] in 1994 and the [[1995 Copa Chile]], though he could only finish as runner-up in 1994 and 1995 of the local Campeonato Nacional championship, a competition organized by the [[Chilean Football Federation]] in parallel to the Primera Division.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

In 1998, Pellegrini had a brief spell back at Palestino before he was bought by Ecuadorian club [[LDU Quito]]. He managed the club to a [[Serie A de Ecuador|national title]] in [[1999 Campeonato Ecuatoriano de Fútbol Serie A|1999]], starting a tradition of coaches that followed him to the Ecuadorian team. Pellegrini also gave the club a good run in the Copa Libertadores, catching the eye of other South American managers.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

===San Lorenzo===
Pellegrini joined Argentine club [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]] in 2001 and led them to their first international title in the [[Copa Mercosur]]. He was recommended to the club by San Lorenzo icon [[Nestor Gorosito]], who had worked with Pellegrini at [[Club Deportivo Universidad Católica|Universidad Católica]]. The recommendation paid dividends, as Pellegrini led San Lorenzo to victory in the Argentine [[2000–01 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Clausura|Clausura]] and the Copa Mercosur, South America's [[UEFA Cup]] equivalent.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

===River Plate===
Pellegrini managed Argentine club [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] from 2002 to 2003 and secured the [[Apertura and Clausura|Clausura]] championships in 2003. He resigned his post at the end of the campaign.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

===Villarreal===
Pellegrini took over the managerial duties of [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] on 1 July 2004. In his first season in charge of the club, Villarreal qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] after finishing third in the league and reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. The following season, Villarreal reached the semi-finals of the [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League]], losing to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Villarreal eventually finished seventh in [[2005–06 La Liga|La Liga]] that year. The following two seasons featured Villarreal finishing in both fifth and second place in the league, the latter being historic for the club. Pellegrini led ''El Submarino Amarillo'' to the [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League knockout stage|Champions League knockout stages]], where they drew Arsenal once again in the quarter-finals, losing 4–1 on aggregate.<ref name=":0" />

At the end of 2007, Villarreal offered Pellegrini an extended contract until 2011. On 31 May 2009, after the last La Liga match for Villarreal, Pellegrini said: "Nobody from [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] has spoken with me. I have a contract with Villarreal, we finished the league today, and tomorrow we go on holiday", after being questioned by the press on rumours that he was in talks with Madrid.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2009-05-30-4071733870_x.htm |newspaper=USA Today | title=Pellegrini denies Madrid talks | date=30 May 2009 | access-date=12 May 2010}}</ref>
On 1 June 2009, a Villarreal executive announced that Pellegrini would no longer continue at the club. The [[Province of Valencia|Valencian]] club executive specified that if Real Madrid wanted to sign the Chilean coach, they would have to pay Pellegrini's €4&nbsp;million termination clause.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kurier.at/sportundmotor/fussball/323150.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603043307/http://www.kurier.at/sportundmotor/fussball/323150.php |archive-date=3 June 2009 |title=Pellegrini neuer Real-Coach |publisher= Kurier |date=1 June 2009|access-date=12 January 2014|language=de}}</ref>

===Real Madrid===
[[File:Manuel Pellegrini.JPG|thumb|upright|Pellegrini as manager of [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] in 2009]]

On 1 June 2009, Pellegrini was appointed as manager of Real Madrid, signing a two-year contract.<ref name=RealIn>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8078185.stm |title=Real appoint Pellegrini as coach |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 June 2009 |access-date=22 May 2018}}</ref> On being presented at the presidential balcony of the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Santiago Bernabéu]], he said: "Hard to say in a few words the excitement and pride that one feels for having been chosen to direct perhaps the most important club in the world."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sofiaecho.com/2009/06/02/728761_real-madrid-appoint-manuel-pellegrini-as-head-coach|title=Real Madrid appoint Manuel Pellegrini as head coach|date=2 June 2009|newspaper=Sofia Echo|access-date=2 June 2009}}</ref> He joined Real Madrid as the first manager in [[Florentino Pérez]]'s second stint as Real Madrid president. After a few days, Pellegrini bought [[Kaká]] from [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], saying, "If we want to win the Champions League and be the best team in the world, we need the best players in the world."<ref name=RealIn/> They later bought [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] for £80&nbsp;million from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Karim Benzema]] from [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] for £30&nbsp;million and [[Xabi Alonso]] for £30&nbsp;million from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

In July 2009, Pellegrini competed in his first cup for the club as manager, the [[Peace Cup 2009]]. The club finished as semi-finalist in the tournament, being eliminated by [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] in a 2–1 loss. On 29 August, Real Madrid won 3–2 at [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]] in Pellegrini's first [[La Liga]] game as manager.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

On 27 October 2009 the club was eliminated from the [[2009–10 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]] during the Round of 16 by the modest [[Segunda División B]] club [[AD Alcorcón|Alcorcón]] with a 4–1 aggregate loss. The Spanish daily ''[[Diario Marca|Marca]]'' named this match "[[Alcorconazo]]" and went on to make many teasing references to Pellegrini. On 10 March 2010, Madrid were eliminated from the [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] by [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in the round-of-16 with a 2–1 aggregate loss. Florentino Pérez issued an ultimatum to Pellegrini after this defeat, warning him that he would be dismissed if he did not win the [[List of Spanish football champions|La Liga title]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/mar/11/real-madrid-pellegrini-champions-league|title=Manuel Pellegrini's nightmare becomes Real as Madrid begin blame game|date=10 March 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=11 March 2010|location=London|first=Sid|last=Lowe}}</ref>

Pellegrini's Real Madrid team achieved 96 points in [[2009–10 La Liga|La Liga]], the highest points total that Real Madrid had ever achieved in a La Liga season up to that point (since surpassed by the [[2011–12 Real Madrid C.F. season|2011–12]] team under [[José Mourinho]]), but still came in runner-up, finishing behind their arch rival [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], who had 99 points. On 26 May 2010, Real Madrid's directors announced that Pellegrini was being dismissed, to be replaced by Mourinho, but that they would have kept him if the opportunity to hire Mourinho had not arisen.<ref name=RealOut>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8706918.stm |title=Real Madrid clear the way for Jose Mourinho |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 May 2010 |access-date=22 May 2018}}</ref>

Pellegrini later reflected on his frustration at not being able to build a team at Real Madrid due to the club's controversial ''[[Galácticos]]'' policy: "I didn't have a voice or a vote at Madrid. They sign the best players, but not the best players needed in a certain position. It's no good having an orchestra with the 10 best guitarists if I don't have a pianist. Real Madrid have the best guitarists, but if I ask them to play the piano they won't be able to do it so well. He [Pérez] sold players that I considered important. We didn't win the Champions League because we didn't have a squad properly structured to be able to win it."<ref>{{cite web |title=Manuel Pellegrini is proving to Real Madrid he is one of the world's top coaches |url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/2292/editorials/2012/11/21/3542305/manuel-pellegrini-is-proving-to-real-madrid-he-is-one-of-the |website=Goal.com |date=21 November 2012 |access-date=11 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Chelsea's veteran stars had better beware, Manuel Pellegrini is a man who likes to build teams his way |last=Liew |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/10003550/Chelseas-veteran-stars-had-better-beware-Manuel-Pellegrini-is-a-man-who-likes-to-build-teams-his-way.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/10003550/Chelseas-veteran-stars-had-better-beware-Manuel-Pellegrini-is-a-man-who-likes-to-build-teams-his-way.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=18 April 2013 |access-date=11 May 2013 |location=London}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

After being released by Real Madrid, on 22 July 2010, Pellegrini received an offer from the [[Mexico national football team|Mexico national team]]; [[Javier Aguirre]] resigned following the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] loss in round 16 in South Africa.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/468/internationals/2010/07/22/2037735/former-real-madrid-coach-manuel-pellegrini-has-mexico-offer|title=Former Real Madrid Coach Manuel Pellegrini Has Mexico Offer|date=26 May 2010|website=Goal.com|publisher=Goal|access-date=5 February 2011}}</ref> Pellegrini, however, eventually signed for La Liga club [[Málaga CF|Málaga]] on a three-year contract, their coach [[Jesualdo Ferreira]] having been dismissed.

===Manchester City===
[[File:Manuel Pellegrini 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|Pellegrini as manager of [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 2013]]

On 30 May 2013, Pellegrini stated he had a verbal agreement to become the new manager of [[Premier League]] club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Manchester City have verbal agreement with me, says Manuel Pellegrini |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/29/manchester-city-manuel-pellegrini |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 May 2013 |access-date=30 May 2013 |location=London}}</ref> On 14 June 2013, Manchester City confirmed Pellegrini's appointment as their new first-team manager on a three-year contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/News/Team-news/2013/June/Pellegrini-announced-as-Man-City-manager |title=Manuel Pellegrini appointed Manchester City manager |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |access-date=15 December 2013 |archive-date=13 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313073808/http://www.mcfc.co.uk/news/team-news/2013/june/pellegrini-announced-as-man-city-manager |url-status=dead }}</ref> Pellegrini was quoted saying he was "delighted to accept this hugely exciting opportunity."<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22909811|title=Manchester City appoint Chilean as manager|date=17 June 2013|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=18 June 2013 }}</ref> Upon joining Manchester City, Pellegrini became only the fifth coach from outside of Europe to [[List of Premier League managers|manage in the Premier League]], and the first Chilean.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/manuel-pellegrini-set-to-become-fourth-south-american-to-manage-in-the-premier-league-8615544.html|title=Manuel Pellegrini set to become fourth South American to manage in the Premier League|access-date=28 July 2013|date=14 May 2013|newspaper=The Independent|location=London|first=Maria|last=Hudd}}</ref>

Pellegrini initially made a shaky start, with four league losses by the end of November, but big wins against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] showed the team's potential. After their fourth league loss against Sunderland on 10 November 2013, City went on a 20-match unbeaten streak (in all competitions), which included a 6–0 win over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], a 3–2 away win at European champions [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], and a 6–3 win over league leaders [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].

After a hectic Christmas period, City's form showed no signs of abating. A 9–0 aggregate win over [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the [[2013–14 Football League Cup|Football League Cup]] semi-final (a competition record) and a 5–1 humbling of Tottenham Hotspur at [[White Hart Lane]] maintained City's average of more than three goals a game. Of the 20 matches, only two were draws, against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], in the [[2013–14 FA Cup|FA Cup]] – both of which ended 1–1. Some opponents openly described City as the best team in the world, and talk about an unprecedented [[List of association football teams to have won four or more trophies in one season|quadruple]] soon arose in the media.<ref>{{cite news |title=Man City best in world, says Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25956275 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 January 2014 |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Man City 5–0 Blackburn: Gary Bowyer hails 'best in world' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25757726 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 January 2014 |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref>

Pellegrini won the Premier League Manager of the Month award for December 2013 and on 18 January 2014, City surpassed 100 goals for the season, in all competitions, in just 34 games – the quickest century in the Premier League era, beating Chelsea's [[2012–13 Chelsea F.C. season|2012–13]] record by eight matches. By the end of January 2014, they had scored 115 goals in all competitions – the most goals scored by any club in Europe. Maintaining such a scoring rate would see them surpass the 143 scored by Manchester United's [[Busby Babes]] in the [[1957–58 Manchester United F.C. season|1957–58 season]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Premier League review: Man City landmark and did Suarez dive? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25800907 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 January 2014 |access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref>

On 2 March 2014, Pellegrini's Manchester City defeated [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] 3–1 at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] in the [[2014 Football League Cup Final]], giving him his first major trophy in European football. On 11 May, Manchester City became [[List of English football champions|Premier League champions]], after beating West Ham United 2–0, with goals from [[Samir Nasri]] and [[Vincent Kompany]] at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]], making Pellegrini the first coach from outside of Europe to win the English league title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27273582|title=Man City 2–0 West Ham|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

==Style of management==
Pellegrini has been roundly praised throughout his career for his attacking managerial style, calm demeanor and excellent man management.
