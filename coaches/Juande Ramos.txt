'''Juan de la Cruz "Juande" Ramos Cano''' (born 25 September 1954) is a former Spanish [[Association football|footballer]] and manager.

After playing and managing at an amateur level, Ramos led [[Rayo Vallecano]] to promotion to [[La Liga]], followed by reaching the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Cup]] in [[2000–01 UEFA Cup|2001]]. After brief spells in [[La Liga]] at [[Real Betis]], [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] and [[Málaga CF|Málaga]], he took over at [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in 2005. In two years at the club, he won the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]  on two occasions, as well as the [[UEFA Super Cup]] in [[2006 UEFA Super Cup|2006]], and also winning the [[Copa del Rey]] and [[Supercopa de España]].

Ramos had a brief spell in England's [[Premier League]], winning the [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in [[2008 Football League Cup Final|2008]]. He then managed [[Real Madrid]], [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], [[FC Dnipro|Dnipro]] and Málaga again.

==Playing career==
Ramos played for Elche, Alcoyano, Linares, Eldense, Alicante and Dénia as a midfielder, until he retired due to a knee injury at the age of 28.<ref>{{cite news |title       = BIOGRAPHY |url         = http://www.juanderamos.com/index.php?s=lang/en/biografia.html&sel=ms2&hl=en |publisher   = Juande Ramos |access-date  = 27 October 2007 |url-status     = dead |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028155254/http://www.juanderamos.com/index.php?s=lang%2Fen%2Fbiografia.html&sel=ms2&hl=en |archive-date = 28 October 2007 |df          = dmy-all}}</ref>

==Management career==

===Early years and Rayo===
Ramos began his managerial career in 1990 at [[Elche CF Ilicitano]]. He went on to manage [[CD Alcoyano|Alcoyano]] and  [[Levante UD|Levante]] in [[Segunda División B]], before joining [[CD Logroñés]] in 1995. In his [[1995–96 Segunda División|one year]] in [[La Rioja]], he guided them to promotion from the [[Segunda División]] in second place behind [[Hércules CF]]. He then moved to [[FC Barcelona B]] – where he was relegated from the same division – and then [[UE Lleida]] and [[Rayo Vallecano]]. In 1999, he won promotion with the team from the outskirts of [[Madrid]] with a playoff victory over [[CF Extremadura]], and took 22 points from the first 30 in [[La Liga]], a record for a newly promoted team. They finished 9th, 17 points off winners [[Deportivo de La Coruña]], and qualified for their first European tournament, the [[UEFA Cup]], via the Fair Play rule.<ref>{{cite news |last1=de Vicente |first1=Marcos |title=Sólo el Rayo de la 1999-00 hizo un mejor inicio que este Granada tras ascender|trans-title=Only Rayo in 1999-00 had a better start than this season's Granada after being promoted|url=https://www.marca.com/futbol/rayo/2019/10/28/5db6bfc7e2704e3c2f8b456f.html |access-date=3 February 2022 |work=Marca |date=28 October 2019 |language=Spanish}}</ref>

In the [[2006–07 Copa del Rey]], Sevilla played city rivals and Ramos' former team Betis in the quarter-finals. After a goalless draw in the first leg at the [[Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium]], [[Frédéric Kanouté]] scored a 55th-minute away goal at Betis in the second leg on 28 February. A Betis fan reacted by throwing a bottle at Ramos's head, knocking him unconscious. The game was abandoned and its remainder was played in March, behind closed doors in [[Getafe]]. The fan was fined €2,700 and paid €360 to Ramos, while the next three games at the [[Estadio Benito Villamarín]] were ordered to be in an empty stadium.<ref>{{cite news |last1=La Casa |first1=Rafa |title=Un busto y un botellazo: el derbi sevillano "total" que acabó jugándose en Getafe |trans-title=The bust and a bottle attack: the "total" Seville derby that ended up being played in Getafe|url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/deportes/futbol/copa-del-rey/2022-01-08/betis-sevilla-derbi-lopera-del-nido-juande-ramos_3354945/ |access-date=3 February 2022 |work=[[El Confidencial]] |date=8 January 2022 |language=Spanish}}</ref>

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Ramos inherited a Tottenham side falling well short of expectations as their poor defending meant they were in the relegation zone when he arrived.<ref>{{cite news| title = Ramos starts work with Tottenham | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/7067020.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 29 October 2007| access-date = 8 February 2008}}</ref> His first game in charge was a 2–0 win against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] at [[White Hart Lane]] on 31 October, courtesy of goals from [[Robbie Keane]] and [[Pascal Chimbonda]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wallace |first1=Sam |title=Tottenham Hotspur 2 Blackpool 0: Ramos cuts an anxious figure despite victory |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/tottenham-hotspur-2-blackpool-0-ramos-cuts-an-anxious-figure-despite-victory-398515.html |access-date=3 February 2022 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=31 October 2007}}</ref> Three days later, his team drew 1–1 at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on his league debut.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lyon |first1=Sam |title=Middlesbrough 1–1 Tottenham |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7065162.stm |access-date=3 February 2022 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 November 2007}}</ref>

On 18 December 2007, Spurs travelled to the [[City of Manchester Stadium]] for their League Cup quarter-final against a [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] who up until that point had won every home game of the season, but despite playing with 10&nbsp;men for more than 70&nbsp;minutes, Ramos still masterminded a 2–0 victory for Tottenham.<ref>{{cite news| title = Man City 0–2 Tottenham | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_cup/7145783.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 18 December 2007| access-date = 8 February 2008}}</ref> This set up a semi-final with North London rivals [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].

However a second half penalty from [[Dimitar Berbatov]] took the game to extra time, where [[Jonathan Woodgate]] scored the winner to give Spurs both their first trophy since 1999 and qualification for the [[2008–09 UEFA Cup]].<ref name=lc08>{{cite news |last1=Stevenson |first1=Jonathan |title=Tottenham 2–1 Chelsea |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/7256729.stm |access-date=3 February 2022 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 February 2008}}</ref>

After spending over £60 million in the summer on [[Luka Modrić]], [[David Bentley]], [[Roman Pavlyuchenko]] and [[Heurelho Gomes]], the [[2008–09 Premier League|2008–09]] season saw Ramos lead Tottenham to their worst ever start to a league campaign, with the team placed bottom of the table after acquiring just two points from their opening eight matches; they had won only three league games since the League Cup win in February. This eventually led to Ramos being sacked on 25 October, along with assistant manager [[Gustavo Poyet|Gus Poyet]], first team coach Marcos Álvarez, and club sporting director [[Damien Comolli]], less than 24&nbsp;hours before the club's next league game with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. [[Harry Redknapp]] was announced as Ramos's immediate replacement.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tottenham sack Ramos for Redknapp |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7691457.stm |access-date=3 February 2022 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 October 2008}}</ref> Tottenham went on to defeat Bolton 2–0 and register their first league win of the season.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barder |first1=Russell |title=Tottenham 2–0 Bolton |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7674169.stm |access-date=3 February 2022 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 October 2008}}</ref>

During his time at Tottenham, Ramos put his players on strict diets, eliminating sugar, swapping juice for water and serving meat with no sauce. He said that his team were a collective 100&nbsp;kg overweight on his arrival, which had halved by February.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jenson |first1=Pete |title=Ramos: Who ate all the paellas? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/ramos-who-ate-all-the-paellas-781955.html|work=The Independent |access-date=3 February 2022 |date=14 February 2008}}</ref> His doctor, Antonio Escribano, likened the players to [[Formula One]] cars that could only perform on the right fuel.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lowe |first1=Sid |title=Spurs' hunger was not a recipe for success |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/14/newsstory.tottenhamhotspur |access-date=3 February 2022 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=14 February 2008}}</ref> Striker [[Darren Bent]] later said that the team began to turn on the manager due to their drab diet, including captain [[Ledley King]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=Joe |title=Darren Bent's hilarious story about the SHOCKING food at Tottenham under Juande Ramos – including BANNING salt, pepper and ketchup |url=https://talksport.com/football/807609/darren-bent-food-tottenham-juande-ramos-ketchup/ |access-date=3 February 2022 |publisher=[[Talksport]] |date=22 December 2020}}</ref>
