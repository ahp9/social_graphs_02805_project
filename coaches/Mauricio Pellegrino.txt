==Playing career==
===Club===
====Vélez and Barcelona====
Born in [[:es:Leones (Argentina)|Leones]], [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/2015/03/03/C-8027-mauricio-pellegrino-pincharrata-por-adopcion.php|title=Mauricio Pellegrino, pincharrata por adopción|trans-title=Mauricio Pellegrino, ''pincharrata'' by adoption|newspaper=[[El Gráfico (Argentina)|El Gráfico]]|last=Molina|first=Pedro|language=es|date=3 March 2015|access-date=21 December 2017}}</ref> Pellegrino played for [[Club Atlético Vélez Sarsfield|Vélez Sarsfield]] during a large portion of the 1990s, as the [[Buenos Aires]]-based club experienced its golden age, winning four [[Argentine Primera División|Primeira División]] championships and the 1994 [[Intercontinental Cup (1960–2004)|Intercontinental Cup]] and [[Copa Libertadores]]. He received the nickname ''El Flaco'' ("The Lanky One") for his physique.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2012/05/07/actualidad/1336419435_108459.html|title="El Flaco te hace pensar"|trans-title="The Lanky One makes you think"|newspaper=[[El País]]|last=Ros|first=Cayetano|language=es|date=7 May 2012|access-date=7 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.superdeporte.es/valencia-cf/2020/04/17/flaco-mauricio-pellegrino-nuevo-equipo-53119491.html|title=El 'Flaco' Mauricio Pellegrino ya tiene nuevo equipo|trans-title='Lanky' Mauricio Pellegrino now has a new team|newspaper=[[Super Deporte]]|last1=Izquierdo|first1=César|last2=Calabuig|first2=Pascu|language=es|date=17 February 2020|access-date=7 October 2021}}</ref>

Pellegrino had his first experience abroad in [[1998–99 La Liga|1998–99]], joining [[Louis van Gaal]]'s [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] on loan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1998/08/29/deportes/904341613_850215.html|title=El Barcelona ficha a Kluivert y a Pellegrino contrarreloj|trans-title=Barcelona sign Kluivert and Pellegrino in the nick of time|newspaper=El País|last=Piñol|first=Àngels|language=es|date=29 August 1998|access-date=27 June 2016}}</ref> He made his [[La Liga]] debut on 12 September 1998 in a 1–0 home win against [[CF Extremadura|Extremadura]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1998/09/13/pagina-2/397656/pdf.html|title=Un Barça muy justito|trans-title=Par-for-course Barça|newspaper=[[Mundo Deportivo]]|last=Astruells|first=Andrés|language=es|date=13 September 1998|access-date=27 June 2016}}</ref> and would be used regularly during the campaign, which ended with league conquest.<ref name=EG>{{cite news|url=http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/2012/02/02/C-4053-pellegrino-a-mourinho-lo-tuve-como-ayudante-de-van-gaal-es-un-buen-tipo.php|title=Pellegrino: "A Mourinho lo tuve como ayudante de Van Gaal, es un buen tipo"|trans-title=Pellegrino: "I had Mourinho as Van Gaal's assistant, he is a good guy"|newspaper=El Gráfico|last=Borinsky|first=Diego|language=es|date=2 February 2012|access-date=27 June 2016}}</ref>

====Valencia====
Pellegrino had his best years with another Spanish side, [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], partnering countryman [[Roberto Ayala]] in the heart of the back-four while helping them to two league titles during his tenure,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spherasports.com/los-muros-historicos-de-la-liga-bbva-46976/|title=Defensas: los muros históricos de la Liga|trans-title=Defenders: the League's historic walls|publisher=Sphera Sports|language=es|date=30 June 2015|access-date=27 June 2016}}</ref> with the addition of the [[2003–04 UEFA Cup|2003–04 edition]] of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]].<ref name=BBC>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/3724215.stm|title=Valencia 2–0 Marseille|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=19 May 2004|access-date=27 June 2016}}</ref> Possessing an [[Italian passport]] through descent, he did not take a slot for non-European Union players in the team.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.abc.es/espana/comunidad-valenciana/abcp-tenemos-congeniar-idea-para-201209100000_noticia.html|title="Tenemos que congeniar una idea para llevar al Valencia hacia adelante"|trans-title="We have to think up an idea to take Valencia forward"|newspaper=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|last=Cosín|first=Raúl|language=es|date=10 September 2012|access-date=14 September 2023}}</ref>

Arguably Pellegrino's worst moment occurred during the [[2000–01 UEFA Champions League|2000–01]] [[2001 UEFA Champions League final|final]] of the [[UEFA Champions League]] as he missed the last [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] attempt against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] (1–1 after 120 minutes)<ref name=BBC2>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/champions_league/1346307.stm|title=Bayern crowned European champions|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 May 2001|access-date=1 December 2012}}</ref>– he also played in [[1999–2000 UEFA Champions League|the previous season]]'s [[2000 UEFA Champions League final|decisive match]], which also ended in defeat, to [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] (3–0).<ref name=TG>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/may/24/championsleague.sport1|title=Real Madrid 3–0 Valencia|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 May 2000|access-date=27 June 2016}}</ref> Overall though, in his six years at the [[Mestalla Stadium|Mestalla]], he was a very important defensive unit, and made 213 official appearances for the ''Che''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.valenciacf.com/en-gaya-s-2020-21-challenge-about-to-begin-2020-08-02|title=Gayà's 2020/21 challenge about to begin|publisher=Valencia CF|date=2 August 2020|access-date=21 February 2024}}</ref>

====Liverpool and retirement====
In early January 2005, after having been frozen out by [[Claudio Ranieri]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2004/10/24/deportes/1098568818_850215.html|title=Ranieri se guarda la munición|trans-title=Ranieri saves ammo|newspaper=El País|last=Torres|first=Diego|language=es|date=24 October 2004|access-date=29 June 2017}}</ref> Pellegrino joined former Valencia boss [[Rafael Benítez]] at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on a [[Free transfer (association football)|free transfer]], signing a six-month contract<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/4144837.stm|title=Liverpool seal Pellegrino signing|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 January 2005|access-date=2 October 2010}}</ref>– this move made him the first Argentine player in the history of the club. He played 12 times for the ''Reds'' in the [[Premier League]] – 13 overall – but his performances were not enough to secure a longer contract, and he was released by the club at the end of [[2004–05 FA Premier League|the season]]. He was [[cup-tied]] for the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League|Champions League campaign]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/apr/03/newsstory.europeanfootball1|title=Rafa trusts in fate and Gerrard|newspaper=The Guardian|last=Wilson|first=Paul|date=3 April 2005|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> and did not feature in the victory over [[AC Milan]] in the [[2005 UEFA Champions League final|final of the competition]].

Afterwards, Pellegrino returned to Spain, having an unassuming stint with [[Deportivo Alavés|Alavés]] (fewer than half of the matches played, [[2005–06 La Liga|top-division relegation]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4103126.stm|title=Alaves sign defender Pellegrino|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 June 2005|access-date=1 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/alaves/20161119/411983590703/pellegrino-alaves-espanyol-gol-de-coro-descenso.html|title=Pellegrino no se olvida del 'gol de Coro'|trans-title=Pellegrino does not forget 'Coro's goal'|newspaper=Mundo Deportivo|language=es|date=19 November 2016|access-date=31 December 2024}}</ref>

===International===
Pellegrino earned three [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], all in 1997. He was picked for the squad at [[1997 Copa América|that year]]'s [[Copa América]] and made his debut in the continental tournament against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] in the group stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rsssf.org/tables/97safull.html|title=Copa América 1997|publisher=[[RSSSF]]|last=Tabeira|first=Martín|access-date=27 June 2016}}</ref>

==Coaching career==
===Early years===
After retiring in June 2006, Pellegrino stayed connected to Valencia, coaching its ''Cadete B'' (youth team). Two years later he returned to Liverpool, who still had Benítez in charge, as first-team coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/7481445.stm|title=Pellegrino returns as Reds coach|publisher=BBC Sport|date=30 June 2008|access-date=1 December 2012}}</ref> In the middle of 2010 the pair moved to [[Inter Milan]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/sport/calcio/serie-a/inter/2010/09/20/news/benitez_attacco-7245695/|title=E' arrivata l'Inter di Benitez|trans-title=Benitez's Inter is here|newspaper=[[La Repubblica]]|last=Sorrentino|first=Andrea|language=it|date=20 September 2010|access-date=29 June 2017}}</ref> where they were dismissed in December.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/9302348.stm|title=Inter Milan sack manager Rafael Benitez|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 December 2010|access-date=29 June 2017}}</ref>
