'''Joseph Jordan''' (born 15 December 1951) is a Scottish former [[Association football|football]] player, manager and coach. A [[Forward (association football)|forward]], Jordan started his senior football career with [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Greenock Morton]]. With [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] he won the [[1973–74 Football League First Division]] and was runner up in the [[1973 European Cup Winners' Cup final]] and the [[1975 European Cup final]]. With [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] he was runner up in the [[1979 FA Cup Final]]. He won the [[1982–83 Serie B]] title with [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and was runner up in the [[1984 Coppa Italia Final]] with [[Hellas Verona]]. He helped [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] to their second highest league finish of fifth in [[1984–85 Football League First Division|1984–85]], for what would have qualified for the [[1985–86 UEFA Cup]] (had English clubs not been banned following the [[Heysel stadium disaster]]). He then ended his playing career with [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] where he also became player-manager.

Jordan gained 52 full [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] caps scoring 11 goals. He is the only Scot to score in three [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]], (in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] and [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]].) For his playing efforts for club and country, he was a [[Scottish Football Hall of Fame]] 2005 inductee.

As well as at Bristol City (twice), he has managed or coached [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]], [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and most recently [[AFC Bournemouth]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Joe Jordan: Bournemouth appoint former Scotland international as first-team coach |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56196095 |website=BBC Sport |date=25 February 2021 |accessdate=16 June 2022 }}</ref>

In his first game for Leeds United reserves, he had two front teeth knocked out. That combined with his strong, fearless and committed play, created his fearsome 'Jaws' persona.

==Early life==
Jordan was born in the village of [[Cleland, North Lanarkshire|Cleland]], [[Lanarkshire]]<ref name=c1/> (sometimes given as the nearby town of [[Carluke]]<ref name=a1/>). After leaving school, Jordan became an apprentice [[technical drawing|draughtsman]]. At age 15, Jordan had also begun playing for the [[Scottish Junior Football Association]] club, [[Blantyre Victoria F.C.|Blantyre Victoria]].

==Club career==

===Morton===
Jordan began his professional career in 1968 joining [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Morton]] from [[Blantyre Victoria]] for £250.<ref name="gretel">{{cite news |last1=McGilp |first1=Niall |title=A tale of two icons: Bobby Collins and Joe Jordan |url=https://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/24783127.tale-two-icons-bobby-collins-joe-jordan/ |access-date=21 May 2025 |work=Greenock Telegraph |date=14 December 2024}}</ref><ref name=a1/> He initially played for Morton part-time.<ref name=c1/> His only Morton goal was in the 4–1 home league win versus [[Partick Thistle]] on 14 April 1970.<ref name=lonhear>{{Cite web|url=https://www.londonhearts.com/scores/allg/morton1970.htm|title=Results for Morton for 1969-70|website=www.londonhearts.com}}</ref> That win clinched Morton's place in the new 'British Cup' tournament, the [[Texaco Cup]]. Four days later he was involved in the build up for [[Bobby Collins (footballer)|Bobby Collins]]' goal, clinching a 2–0 win at [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].<ref name=gretel/>

39-year old Collins was Morton's player-coach. He had started his professional career playing for the club Jordan supported as a boy, [[Celtic FC|Celtic]].<ref name=c1/> Collins in 1962 joined [[Don Revie]]'s [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] for five seasons. Revie later described Collins as 'the best signing I ever made'. As well as his Morton duties, Collins was now also Leeds' scout in [[Scotland]]. Collins personally recommended Jordan to Revie. Revie watched Jordan in Morton's Texaco Cup game at [[West Bromwich Albion]]. Morton won both legs versus West Brom (2–1 home and 1–0 away), for a 3–1 aggregate victory.<ref name=texaco>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablest/texacohist.html|title=Anglo-Scottish Cup & Texaco Cup - Full Results|website=www.rsssf.org}}</ref> Jordan described Collins as his 'footballing godfather'. Jordan recalled the Rangers game in his book: "I got involved in the move that resulted in a goal for Collins, my hero and, as it turned out, the man who put in the word that carried me to where I wanted to be, at the top of the professional game."<ref name=gretel/>

In total Jordan made 12 Morton league and cup appearances.<ref name=gretel/>

===Leeds United===
Aged 18, Jordan signed for Revie at Leeds in November 1970 for £15,000 plus an extra £5,000 dependent on Jordan making Leeds' first-team.<ref name=gretel/><ref name=a1/> There was little initial prospect of Jordan making the Leeds first-team, due to the well established, successful [[Allan Clarke (footballer)|Allan Clarke]] and [[Mick Jones (footballer, born 1945)|Mick Jones]] forward partnership.<ref name=a1/> In 1973, Jordan made 16 League starts and scored nine goals. However, he was left out of the team that lost the [[1973 FA Cup final|FA Cup final]] 1-0 to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. He played in the [[1973 European Cup Winners' Cup final]] 1-0 defeat to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. Jordan scored seven goals in his 25 games in Leeds' [[1973–74 Leeds United A.F.C. season|1973-74]] League winning team.

By 1974, Jordan was Leeds' main [[target man]] providing many knock-downs, especially for [[Peter Lorimer]]. With other Scottish players at Leeds, Jordan formed part of the so-called '[[Scottish mafia#Other uses|Scottish mafia]]', alongside goalkeeper [[David Harvey (footballer)|David Harvey]] (1965–1980, 1982–1984), defender [[Gordon McQueen]] (1972–1978), midfielder [[Billy Bremner]] (1959–1976), left winger [[Eddie Gray (footballer, born 1948)|Eddie Gray]] (1965–1983) and right winger [[Peter Lorimer]] (1963–1979, 1983–1986).<ref name=a1/>

In the [[1974-75 European Cup]], Jordan scored in the home first-leg wins over [[FC Zürich]] (4-1 for 5-3 on aggregate) and [[Anderlecht]] (3-0 for 4-0 on aggregate). Leeds also eliminated [[Újpesti Dózsa]] (5-1 on aggregate) and [[FC Barcelona]] (3-2 on aggregate). Jordan and Leeds lost the [[1975 European Cup final]] 2–0 to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]].<ref name="uefa75">{{Cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/errors/|title=The official website for European football|website=UEFA.com}}</ref>

In Jordan's 135 Leeds league games he scored 39 goals.<ref name=a1/>

===Manchester United===
Aged 26, Jordan signed for [[Dave Sexton]]<ref name=sextobit>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/26/dave-sexton|title=Dave Sexton obituary|first=Gavin|last=McOwan|date=26 November 2012|via=The Guardian}}</ref> for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 4 January 1978 for £350,000.<ref name=mufcinfo>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mufcinfo.com/manupag/a-z_player_archive/a-z_player_archive_pages/jordan_joseph.html|title=Joe Jordan: Man United forward Profile & Stats|website=www.mufcinfo.com}}</ref> Jordan reached the [[1979 FA Cup final]], losing 3–2 to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref name=a1/> During a [[1979–80 FA Cup|1980 FA Cup]] third round replay at [[Old Trafford]], Jordan clashed with Tottenham Hotspur's goalkeeper [[Milija Aleksic]], dislocating Aleksic's jaw. ''The Independent'' in 2011 described this as a revenge act for Aleksic having repeatedly been charging Jordan during corners.<ref name=a3/> It became known as the game that saw Tottenham's [[Glenn Hoddle]] play in goal.<ref name=c9/> 

In the four seasons Jordan played in at Old Trafford, they were runners-up in the [[1979-80 Football League First Division]]. They recovered from a poor start to the season to finish two points (two for a win) off top spot.<ref name=deca>{{Cite web|url=https://www.manutd.com/en/history/history-by-decade|title=Man Utd History by Decade|website=www.manutd.com}}</ref> Winners were [[Liverpool FC|Liverpool]],<ref name=leag80>{{Cite web|url=http://www.englishfootballstats.co.uk/Level%201%20Tables/1979-80.htm|title=English Football Stats - Past League Tables - Football League First Division - 1979/80}}</ref> who for 15 years from the mid 1970s succeeded Leeds as England's team to beat.<ref name=fcen>{{Cite web|url=https://www.footiecentral.com/20151206/greatest-football-records-of-liverpool-of-the-70s-and-80s/|title=Greatest Football Records of Liverpool of the 70s and 80s|first=Wasi|last=Manazir|date=6 December 2015}}</ref> Jordan top scored for United that season with 13 goals, all in the league. United's second place finish qualified them for the [[1980-81 UEFA Cup]], as did [[Bobby Robson]]'s [[Ipswich Town]] who finished third. United were eliminated in the UEFA Cup first round by [[Widzew Łódź]] on away goals after drawing 1-1 at home and then 0-0 in [[Poland]]. Ipswich won the UEFA Cup that season.<ref name="uefa75"/> Jordan top scored again that season, this time with 15 (all in the league).

===Milan===
Aged 29, in July 1981 Jordan transferred to AC Milan.<ref name=mufcinfo/> He played in the [[1981–82 Serie A]] season. He thus succeeded [[Denis Law]] to be the second Scotsman to both play in and score in the [[Italian Football Championship]], since its landmark [[1929-30 Serie A]] re[[brand]]. Jordan scored two goals in his 22 Serie A games that season,<ref name=scotit>{{Cite web|url=https://rsssf.org/players/scot-players-in-it.html|title=Scottish Players and Coaches in Italy|website=rsssf.org}}</ref> the first of which was the opener in a 7 November 1981, 1-1 home draw v [[Como 1907|Como]].<ref name=itcha82>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablesi/ital82.html|title=Italy Championship 1981/82|website=www.rsssf.org}}</ref>

In the [[1981-82 Coppa Italia]], Milan finished third in the five team group behind group winners, [[Internazionale]], and [[Hellas Verona]]. Jordan's header put Milan 2-1 ahead v Inter in the 49th minute. [[Walter Novellino]] had put Milan ahead before [[Alessandro Altobelli]] equalised. [[Giuseppe Bergomi]] though added a second Inter equaliser in the 89th minute for 2-2 final score.<ref name=gent>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gentlemanultra.com/2017/04/27/joe-lo-squalo-jordan-ac-milans-penalty-box-predator/|title=Joe 'Lo Squalo' Jordan: AC Milan's penalty box predator -|first=Luca|last=Hodges-Ramon|date=27 April 2017}}</ref>

Milan won the 1981/82 [[Mitropa Cup]]. Their opponents in the 4 team round-robin competition were [[MFK Vítkovice|TJ Vítkovice]], [[Szombathelyi Haladás|Haladás]] and [[NK Osijek]].<ref name=mit82>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablesm/mit82.html|title=Mitropa Cup 1981/82|website=www.rsssf.org}}</ref>

Milan went into the last game of the league season in 14th; the third of the relegation places in the 16 team division. To avoid relegation they needed to catch [[Genoa CFC|Genoa]] who were better off by both of two points (two points for a win), and a goal difference of four. After 63 minutes, Genoa were losing 2-1 at [[SSC Napoli]]. Milan though were losing 2-0 at [[AC Cesena]]. Jordan scored in the 67th minute to ignite a comeback to lead 3-2 after 81 minutes. Genoa though equalised in the 85th minute to draw 2-2. With no further goals in either of these 2 games, Milan were relegated.<ref name=itcha82/> In all domestic competitions Jordan joint top-scored for Milan that season with six goals with [[Roberto Antonelli]].

In playing in [[Serie B 1982–83]] season, Jordan became the first Scotsman to play in [[Serie B]] since its creation in the 1929 Italian football re-structure. He scored 10 goals in 30 Serie B games,<ref name=scotit/> with Milan losing only 2 league games all season and never out of the top two places in the table from match week four onwards. They won promotion back to Serie A as Serie B champions (eight points ahead of 2nd placed [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]]). He was again joint top scorer for Milan, this time with 14 goals (from his 36 league and cup appearances) along with [[Aldo Serena]]. Penalties were not taken by an attacking player but by defender, [[Franco Baresi]]. Jordan's 30 Serie B appearances record for a Scotsman has since been surpassed by [[Liam Henderson]] in 2019. Henderson in 2023 equalled Jordan's record 10 career Serie B goals record by a Scotsman. Henderson's Serie B goals, though, were not in one season.<ref name=hend>{{Cite web|url=https://sg.soccerway.com/players/liam-henderson/265494/|title=Liam Henderson Stats &#124; Soccerway|website=sg.soccerway.com}}</ref> 

In the [[1982-83 Coppa Italia]] six team group stage Milan lost only once in their five games, to two [[Paolo Rossi]] [[Juventus]] goals. Jordan scored for Milan in that away 2-1 defeat. Another of Jordan's Coppa goals was in the group stage home win versus Serie A club Genoa. 2-0 down to a [[Mauro Tassotti]] own goal and a [[René Vandereycken]] strike, Jordan's 43rd minute goal sparked a comeback. Serena added two for a 3-2 win. In the quarter-final, Milan played against [[Hellas Verona]], riding high that season to a fourth place Serie A finish and [[UEFA Cup]] qualification. Milan drew the first leg 2-2 away to their opponents from the division above. In the 2nd leg in Milan, Jordan put his team 3-1 ahead in the 54th minute (Baresi had opened the scoring with a penalty). However, after [[Domenico Penzo]] made it 3-3 in the 89th minute, Milan were eliminated 5-5 on away goals.<ref name=coppa82>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablesi/italcup83.html|title=Coppa Italia 1982/83|website=www.rsssf.org}}</ref><ref name=goal>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/it/notizie/joe-jordan-leggendario-squalo-scozzese-in-italia-milan-e-verona/blte16a368c512d0360|title=Joe Jordan, il leggendario 'Squalo' scozzese che giocò in Italia con Milan e Verona &#124; Goal.com Italia|date=14 February 2023|website=www.goal.com}}</ref>
 
Jordan played two seasons for Milan, scoring 12 goals in his 52 league games.<ref name=c4/> Jordan made 66 domestic league and cup Milan appearances, scoring 20 goals.<ref name=milstat>[https://www.acmilan.com/en/club/legends/players/jordan "Joe Jordan: stats and matches | AC Milan" acmilan.com]</ref>

On the eve of a return to the club in a Champions League game in 2011, as a coach with Tottenham, Jordan said the move to Milan, one of the biggest clubs in the world, was the best move of his career. He opined that it gave him experience he had always wanted, namely a chance to play abroad.<ref name=c4/> He has explained he retained strong links with [[Milan]]. One of his four children, Caroline, lives there with her children raised Italian.<ref name=kit>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/23701755.scotland-legend-joe-jordan-launches-new-hellas-verona-kit/|title='Unforgettable Scottish champion' Joe Jordan helps launch Serie A side's new kit|date=4 August 2023|website=The Herald}}</ref>

===Hellas Verona===
Aged 31, in 1983 Jordan transferred to fellow Serie A club, [[Hellas Verona]]. While Jordan had been in Serie B with Milan, Verona finished fourth in the [[1982–83 Serie A]], earning a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] berth. Jordan played three Verona [[1983-84 UEFA Cup]] games. He subbed on in the first round, first leg 1-0 home win v [[Red Star Belgrade]] as part of a 4-2 aggregate win. He thus became the first Scotsman to play for an Italian club in [[UEFA]] organised competition. In the second round, he played all 90 minutes of the 2-2 home draw and subbed on in the 0-0 away draw v [[SK Sturm Graz]]. Verona were thus eliminated on the away goals rule without having lost a game over 90 minutes in that season's UEFA Cup.<ref name=veruef>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldfootball.net/person/pe60260/joe-jordan/|title=Joe Jordan &raquo; Europa League 1983/1984|website=worldfootball.net}}</ref>

Jordan scored once in nine [[1983-84 Coppa Italia]] games, opening the scoring in the semi-final first leg 2-1 win at [[SSC Bari]].<ref name=barver>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hellastory.net/verona/almanacco/s/tabellino/13-06-1984/bari_verona_hellas/|title=Bari-Verona Hellas 1-2 (13.06.1984) &#124; Almanacco &#124; HELLASTORY.net|website=www.hellastory.net}}</ref> Jordan subbed on in both legs of the [[1984 Coppa Italia final]], which they lost for the second season in a row, this time to [[AS Roma]]. After drawing the first leg 1-1 at home, they lost 1-0 in Rome. That defeat in Rome was Jordan's last Verona game.<ref name=romhel>https://www.hellastory.net/verona/almanacco/s/tabellino/26-06-1984/roma_verona_hellas/ "Roma-Verona Hellas 1-0" https://www.hellastory.net]</ref> He was the first Scotsman to play in a Coppa Italia final.

Despite his limited game time, Jordan's season with Verona is looked back upon as successful. Verona fans immediately loved Jordan, appreciating his passion and commitment on the pitch. They displayed a large Scottish flag in the Curva Sud because of him. He is credited with passing on valuable experience to Iorio, Galderisi and other young players at the club ahead of their campaign the next season. Replacing Jordan the season after with [[Preben Elkjaer]] up front, Verona were Italian football league champions for the first time in their history in [[1984-85 Serie A|1985]] (including seasons before the 1929 re-brand to Serie A).<ref name=hell/> In August 2023, Jordan was asked by Verona to launch a new club kit. The club said: "Hellas Verona are proud to present the new third match shirt which the players will wear in the 2023/24 season, which sees an example of excellence wearing it forty years after his only season in gialloblù, the unforgettable Scottish champion Joe Jordan."<ref name=kit/>

===Southampton===
Aged 32, in 1984 Jordan returned to England, signing for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] manager [[Lawrie McMenemy]] for £150,000.<ref name="ITN"/> In his first season there he shared 34 league and cup goals partnering [[Steve Moran]] up front.<ref name=saints>{{cite web |title=Joseph Jordan AKA Joe Jordan |url=https://www.saintsplayers.co.uk/player/joe-jordan/ |website=saintsplayers.co.uk |access-date=21 May 2025}}</ref> Jordan played for Saints in that season's UEFA Cup, drawing 0–0 at home against [[Hamburger SV]] before elimination after an away leg 2–0 defeat to goals by [[Manfred Kaltz]] and [[Mark McGhee]].<ref name="wfs">{{cite web |title=Joe Jordan » Europa League 1984/1985 |url=https://www.worldfootball.net/person/pe60260/joe-jordan/ |website=worldfootball.net |access-date=21 May 2025}}</ref> Southampton finished fifth in the [[Football League First Division]] that season. Jordan was their league top scorer with 12 goals from his total league and cup tally of 16. Moran's 18 was higher when totalling league and cup strikes. This is Southampton's [[List of Southampton F.C. seasons|second highest ever league finish]] (surpassed only by finishing second the season before). Fifth would have earned a [[UEFA Cup]] place. However, English clubs started a ban that season following the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster]].<ref name="heys">{{cite web |last1=Spencer |first1=Janie |title=The English Clubs Banned From European Competition After the Heysel Disaster & What Might Have Been |url=https://www.90min.com/posts/the-english-clubs-banned-from-european-competition-after-the-heysel-disaster-what-might-have-been-01e9tvvqrrxq |website=90min.com |date=2 June 2020 |access-date=21 May 2025}}</ref>

In summer 1985, McMenemy left, replaced by [[Chris Nicholl]] who Jordan "didn't know" and would "never get to know". Jordan then severely damaged his knee in a training ground collision with reserve [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Phil Kite (footballer) |Phil Kite]]. Cartilage and medial-ligament injury meant he was out of the first team until March. He then lost his place in the first team in summer 1986 when the club signed [[Colin Clarke (footballer, born 1962)|Colin Clarke]]. Jordan scored for Saints in the [[1986-87 Football League Cup]] September 3–0 home win versus [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]].<ref name=soutw>{{cite web |title=Southampton v Swindon Town, 23 September 1986 |url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/southampton-v-swindon-town-23-september-1986-31552/ |website=11v11.com |access-date=21 May 2025}}</ref> That was his only game in Southampton's run to that season's semi-final.<ref name=sout11>{{cite web |title=Southampton football club match record: 1987 |url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/southampton/tab/matches/season/1987/ |website=11v11.com |access-date=21 May 2025}}</ref>

===Bristol City===

Aged 35, in February 1987 <ref name="ITN"/><ref name=saints/> Jordan free transferred to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], where he finished his playing career.<ref name=a1/> He was also player-manager from 1988 to 1989. In 57 Bristol City appearances he scored eight goals, all of which were when City were in the [[Football League Third Division]].

==International career==

On 19 May 1973, three days after appearing in the European Cup Winners Cup final for Leeds, [[Willie Ormond]] debuted Jordan for the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]]. Jordan subbed on in the 74th minute for [[Lou Macari]] in a 1–0 defeat to [[England national football team|England]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].<ref name=rsssfsco>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rsssf.org/tabless/scot-intres1975.html|title=Scotland - International Matches 1971-1975|website=www.rsssf.org}}</ref>

On 26 September 1973, Jordan scored with a diving header for the winning goal in a 2–1 comeback win against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] at [[Hampden Park]]. That win clinched Scotland [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification]] for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] in [[West Germany]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/joe-jordan-knows-what-its-score-goal-earn-scotland-world-cup-finals-place-1438332 |title=Joe Jordan knows what it's like to score the goal to earn Scotland a World Cup finals place |date=5 October 2017 |newspaper=The Scotsman |access-date=4 December 2020}}</ref> That was Scotland's first World Cup qualification since [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]], having failed in three attempts since '58.<ref name=a1/>

At the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]], Jordan scored the second goal in Scotland's opening group game, 2–0 win over [[Congo DR national football team|Zaire]]. After the 0-0 draw versus Brazil, he equalised in the last minute to draw 1–1 versus [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].<ref name=times>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/joe-jordans-history-of-world-cup-near-misses-pzc80lrnd |title=Joe Jordan's history of World Cup near-misses |first=Douglas |last=Alexander |date=3 June 2018 |access-date=4 December 2020 |newspaper=The Sunday Times}}</ref> Scotland finished the group unbeaten, but were eliminated at that stage on [[goal difference]].<ref name=times/>

Subbed off injured in the same game, he never played for Scotland again. In total, Jordan earned 52 full Scotland [[cap (sport)|caps]], scoring 11 goals.<ref name=a1/>

==Coaching and management career==

===Bristol City===
Initially player-manager, Jordan was in charge at Bristol City from March 1988 to September 1990 for 134 games. In his first season, City finished fifth in the [[1987–88 Football League]] third division. That qualified City for the play-offs in which they lost a final replay to [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]].<ref name=citrov>{{Cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/bristol-city/tab/matches/season/1988/|title=Bristol City match record: 1988|website=www.11v11.com}}</ref>

In February 1989, City lost 2-1 on aggregate in the [[1988–89 Football League Cup]] semi-final to eventual winners, [[Nottingham Forest]].<ref name=leaguecup>{{Cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/bristol-city/tab/matches/season/1989/|title=Bristol City match record: 1989|website=www.11v11.com}}</ref> Among Jordan's signings was [[Bob Taylor (footballer, born 1967)|Bob Taylor]] from Leeds in March 1989. City bought Taylor for £250,000 plus [[Carl Shutt]] valued at £50,000. Taylor scored eight goals in the 12 City league games he played in that [[1988–89 Football League]] season.<ref name=favbob>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/favourite-bristol-city-player-math-4076584|title=My favourite City player: Math Withers on striking sensation 'Super' Bob Taylor|first1=Matthew|last1=Withers|first2=James|last2=Piercy|date=25 April 2020|website=Bristol Live}}</ref>

Taylor's 27 league goals made him the divisions leading scorer in the [[1989–90 Football League]].<ref name=taygoa>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablese/engtops.html|title=English League Leading Goalscorers|website=www.rsssf.org}}</ref> Taylor also scored seven cup goals for 34 in total that season. [[Robbie Turner]] was Taylor's strike partner. [[Alan Walsh (footballer)|Alan Walsh]], [[Mark Gavin]] and [[Dave Smith (footballer, born 1961)|Dave Smith]] were the providers for the strikers. Taylor tore a hamstring in a 4-1 win at [[Crewe Alexandra]]. That caused to Taylor to miss the next six of the season's last seven games. In Taylor's six game absence, City managed only one win and three draws. In the last of they six games, City lost 3-0 at [[Bristol Rovers]]. Rovers over took City at the top of the table that day. City were promoted as runners-up to their Bristol rivals.<ref name=flashb>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/bristol-city-flashback-super-bob-4636772|title=When 'Super' Bob Taylor showed his class against Swansea City|first=Richard|last=Latham|date=24 October 2020|website=Bristol Live}}</ref>

===Hearts===
In September 1990 Jordan was appointed manager of [[Edinburgh]] based [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Scottish Premier Division]] club, [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]]. After a poor start to that season, Hearts had sacked their manager of eight years [[Alex MacDonald (footballer, born 1948)|Alex MacDonald]]. They turned to Jordan as a high-profile ex-Scotland international striker.<ref name=a7/> He took charge of the club from 10 September.<!--http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/man/aamanagers.html-->

With 63 points from 44 games, the club finished second in the [[1991–92 Scottish Premier Division]]. Hearts finished nine points behind the champions [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and one point ahead of third placed [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. Hearts led the league for a significant part of the season, losing just two of their first 28 games. In the [[1991–92 Scottish Cup]] semi-final they were eliminated in a replay, penalty shoot-out by [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrieonians]] at Hampden Park. In the [[1992–93 Scottish Cup]] semi-final they lost 2–1 to Rangers at [[Celtic Park]].

After a poor run in the [[1992–93 in Scottish football|1992–93 season]], including a 6–0 loss to [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]], later described by the club as a thrashing, the board sacked Jordan.<ref name=a7/> Jordan left the club on 3 May 1993, having registered 69 wins, 31 draws and 43 losses, from 143 competitive games.<!--http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/man/aamanagers.html--> Speaking in 2010, Jordan asserted he had done "particularly well" and the dismissal was undeserved. He reflected, "That's life, you get on with it, nobody's going to listen to your sad stories, but that was a sore one".<ref name=c1/>

===Celtic===
After Hearts, in 1993 Jordan became assistant manager to [[Liam Brady]] at [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], said to be out of an emotional attachment to the club he supported as a boy, and to Brady. Having been in the job since 1991, Brady resigned just four months after Jordan arrived, and he felt obliged to do the same, stating in 2010 that he felt no regrets and that "You've just got to make those calls."<ref name=c1/>

===Stoke City===
Jordan was appointed manager of [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in November 1993, replacing fellow Scot [[Lou Macari]]. Macari had left to join Jordan's previous club, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].<ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City">{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Tony|title=The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City|year=1994|publisher=Lion Press|isbn=0-9524151-0-0}}</ref> Jordan was not a popular choice amongst many Stoke fans after it seemed [[Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)|Denis Smith]] was to be appointed.<ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/> They eventually accepted Jordan but the style of play served up, soon began to cause terracing grumblings. The side slowly got results going despite the football style on offer. Stoke finished the [[1993–94 Stoke City F.C. season|1993–94 season]] in 10th position.<ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/> The [[1994–95 Stoke City F.C. season|1994–95 season]] saw no change in the relationship between Jordan and the supporters. It came as little surprise when after a couple of 4–0 defeats, he resigned on 8 September 1994. The returning Lou Macari replaced him.<ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/>

===Bristol City===
He managed Bristol City for 130 games in his second spell, from November 1994 to March 1997.

===Northern Ireland===
Between 1998 and 2000, he was assistant manager to [[Lawrie McMenemy]]. They unsuccessfully tried to get [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] to qualify for the [[Euro 2000|2000 European Championships]].<ref name="ITN"/>

===Huddersfield Town===
From December 2000 until May 2002, he was assistant to his former Manchester United team-mate [[Lou Macari]] at [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].

===Portsmouth===
In 2004 Jordan joined manager [[Harry Redknapp]]'s [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] coaching team, to also work with assistant manager, [[Kevin Bond (English footballer)|Kevin Bond]].<ref name=c1/> After Redknapp's departure in dispute with Director of Football, [[Velimir Zajec]] Jordan coached under [[Alain Perrin]]. Jordan took over as caretaker manager for two games in November 2005 after Perrin's departure.<ref name=c1/> Redknapp then returned after resigning from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. Portsmouth beat [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] 1–0 at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 17 May to win the [[2008 FA Cup Final]].<ref name=c1/>

On the morning of 26 October 2008, Redknapp left Portsmouth after agreeing a £5m compensation deal. He instead became the new manager of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. That left assistant manager [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] and first-team coach Jordan in charge of the team that day. They drew 1–1 at home with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].<ref name=b7/><ref name=b9/> Adams was formally appointed Portsmouth manager two days later. Adams said, "Joe is Portsmouth through and through, he's part of the woodwork."<ref name=b8/>

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 7 November 2008 Jordan left Portsmouth to join Redknapp at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] as first-team coach. That reformed the original Portsmouth back room team; Redknapp had brought in the recently sacked [[AFC Bournemouth]] manager Kevin Bond as Tottenham assistant manager.<ref name=b6/>

===Queens Park Rangers===
In November 2012, Jordan re-united with [[Harry Redknapp]] at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] as first-team coach.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scotland: Joe Jordan to meet QPR boss Harry Redknapp|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20476701|website=BBC Sport|date=24 November 2012 |access-date=26 April 2013}}</ref>

===Middlesbrough===
On 17 March 2017, Jordan was appointed as assistant first-team manager under caretaker manager [[Steve Agnew]] at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Steve Agnew Appoints Joe Jordan To Assist With First Team Duties|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/news/article/2016/middlesbrough-football-club-joe-jordan-steve-agnew-3630572.aspx|publisher=Middlesbrough F.C.|access-date=17 March 2017|date=17 March 2017}}</ref> Jordan left his post at the end of the [[2016–17 Middlesbrough F.C. season|2016–17 season]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===AFC Bournemouth===
On 25 February 2021, AFC Bournemouth announced that Jordan had joined the coaching staff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.afcb.co.uk/news/club-news/jordan-joins-cherries-as-coach/|title=Jordan joins Cherries as coach|website=AFCB}}</ref> Jordan left his role after the 2020–21 season, upon the expiration of his contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/19402243.joe-jordan-departs-cherries-contract-expires/|title=Joe Jordan departs Cherries after contract expires|website=Bournemouth Echo|date=27 June 2021 }}</ref>

==Recognition==
In 2005, Jordan was one of 11 players inducted into the [[Scottish Football Hall of Fame]].<ref name=a8/> Having been born in 1951, Jordan was the second youngest of the 2005 inductees, behind the then [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] manager [[Alex McLeish]], born in 1959, and with the oldest being [[Charles Campbell (footballer)|Charles Campbell]], born "circa 1850s".<ref name=a8/> Honouring the "truly great players, managers and officials who have reached the pinnacle of their profession and have made a significant contribution to Scotland's football reputation through their skill, spirit and determination", the induction followed the inaugural 20 Hall of Fame entrants, inducted in November 2004.<ref name=a9/> Citing his "highly successful career at club level" at Leeds, Manchester United and Milan, the Hall of Fame stated Joe would probably be best remembered for his crucial 1973 World Cup qualifying goal against Czechoslovakia.<ref name=a8/>

According to STV in 2010, for his efforts for the Scotland national team as "[[braveheart]] Joe", for the "all round bravery and commitment to the cause whenever he [played for Scotland]" and particularly the crucial goal against Czechoslovakia in 1973, and the controversial penalty against Wales in 1977 (described as the 'hand of Joe', in reference to the later infamous [[Hand of God goal]] in 1986), Jordan's "status as a Scottish legend is safely assured" among the [[Tartan Army]] of Scotland's supporters.<ref name=a1/> According to ''The Herald'', Jordan's hero status took hold with the goal against Czechoslovakia, due to both its significance and the fact it had been seemingly scored "as if it were an act of sheer will."<ref name=c1/>

On the occasion of the 110th anniversary of A.C. Milan, Jordan has been included in the list of the ''110 most important players in the history of A.C. Milan'' .

Jordan is described by ''The Herald'' as having crossed two eras in his career – having been a Scottish player at the time they were revered in the English game, he has gone on to coach in England as one of seven Scottish managers or coaches in the Premier League. He attributes this to a common determination and desire to win.<ref name=c1/> In contrast to his playing career, Jordan has lamented the state of the game in Scotland in the late 2000s, which has seen a decline in domestic and international Scottish football, and profile of Scottish players in England, and a drying up of opportunities and even the availability of up and coming local players, contrasted to his era with contemporaries like [[Asa Hartford]], [[Kenny Dalglish]] and [[Danny McGrain]].<ref name=c1/>

=='Jaws' persona==
Jordan was nicknamed "Jaws" early in his playing career due to his lack of front teeth, which had been knocked out during a Leeds United reserve match after he was kicked in the face during a goalmouth scramble.<ref name=a3/><ref name=c1/> Although they were replaced by [[dentures]], these were removed for safety reasons while playing.<ref name=a1/> In Italy Jordan was nicknamed ''Lo Squalo'' ("The Shark").<ref name=a3/> When Jordan was manager of Bristol City, fans in the stands waved giant inflatable teeth.<ref name=d2/> According to ''The Times'' in 2009, images of Jordan's "ferocious fangs as a player still regularly [appeared in] Scottish newpapers [sic] whenever an excuse can be found to hark back to the game's golden age".<ref name=d3/> Jordan was involved in several confrontations during his time at Tottenham, including with [[Roy Hodgson]],<ref name=a4/> [[Paul Ince]],<ref name=a5/> [[Alan Pardew]], [[Andy Woodman]],<ref name=c2/><ref name=c3/> and [[Gennaro Gattuso]].<ref name=c6/><ref name=c7/> Jordan said in 2010 that he rejected the caricature that went along with his persona, stating "I was what I was, but I look back and I had seven years at Leeds, who were one of the top teams in Europe, then I got a transfer to Manchester United, then a transfer to AC Milan. These are top clubs, and I had opportunities to go to Liverpool, Arsenal, Ajax. I'm not saying that to brag; if those teams thought I had something to offer, it was more than having no teeth."<ref name=c1/>

==Playing and management style==
As one of the nominees for a public vote organised in April 2010 by [[STV (TV network)|STV]] to name 'Scotland's Greatest Team', Jordan was described as an "uncompromising, old fashioned centre forward who was never afraid to put his head where it hurts for club and country", adding that during the 1970s and 1980s "there were few more fearsome sights in world football" than Jordan.<ref name=a1/>

In a 2007 list compiled by ''[[The Times]]'' Jordan was ranked as the 34th hardest man in the history of the game, with the citation "There have been few more fearsome sights in the European game than 'Jaws' Jordan without his front teeth."<ref name=a2/> [[David O'Leary]], when reflecting on his entire playing career as a defender (spent mostly at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] between 1975 and 1993) he said of Jordan that he was the most combative forward he had ever faced.<ref name=c1/> He has also been described as a [[:wikt:powerhouse|powerhouse]] in aerial play.<ref name=a1/>

Citing his dislocation of Milija Aleksic's jaw in 1980 as an example, ''The Independent'' described in 2011 how Jordan was a player who "did not stand for nonsense on the pitch".<ref name=a3/> According to ''The Herald'' writing in 2010, alongside his strong play, which due to the way the game was played at that time was almost a necessity if forwards wanted to succeed, Jordan also had a refinement to his game.<ref name=c1/>

Following the clash with Gattuso, playing on his hardman reputation, ''[[The Independent]]'' listed the "Five reasons not to mess with Joe Jordan".<ref name=a3/> Redknapp has said of Jordan as a coach that "You could put your life on him... He is quiet, but when he says something, it is worth listening to."<ref name=c1/>

In coaching, Jordan is described by ''The Herald'' as still having the presence and natural authority he had as a player, and of having an enigmatic solemnity about him.<ref name=c1/> In the same interview, while living in [[Bristol]], Jordan was described as having the intensified [[Scottish national identity|Scottish patriotism]] of an exile, who was willing to seize the opportunity to [[Scotland national football team#Managers|manage the Scotland national team]] since 2002.<ref name=c1/>

==Personal life==
Jordan has two sons who have both played professional football: [[Tom Jordan (footballer)|Tom]] and [[Andy Jordan (footballer)|Andy]] (who retired due to injury after leaving [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]]). One of his two daughters lives and works in Italy. He has an interest in fine wines, picked up from his time playing in Italy.<ref name=c1/> Jordan supported [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] as a boy.<ref name=c1/> As of March 2010, Jordan lived with his family in Bristol.<ref name=c1/>
