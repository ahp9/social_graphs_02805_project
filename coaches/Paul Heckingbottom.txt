'''Paul Heckingbottom''' (born 17 July 1977) is an English [[Association football|football]] coach and former player who is the manager of [[EFL Championship]] club [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].

After retiring as a player, Heckingbottom trained as a coach. He obtained a position with Barnsley's development squad and, after a successful spell as caretaker manager in which the club won promotion and the [[EFL Trophy]], he was appointed manager in 2016. In February 2018 he moved to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], but was dismissed during the 2018 close season after 16 games in charge. Heckingbottom then managed [[Scottish Premiership]] club [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], but was dismissed in November 2019. 

In March 2021, he was appointed interim manager of [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] until the end of the season. After briefly returning to the U23s, he was appointed permanent manager of the club in November 2021, following the dismissal of [[Slaviša Jokanović]]. After guiding Sheffield United to promotion from the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] as runners-up in the [[2022–23 EFL Championship|2022–23 season]], Heckingbottom was dismissed in December 2023 with the club bottom of the Premier League. In August 2024, he was appointed as manager of [[EFL Championship]] club [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].<ref>https://www.pnefc.net/news/2024/august/20/paul-heckingbottom-appointed-first-team-manager/ {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref>

==Career==
===Early career===
Heckingbottom was born in [[Barnsley]] and grew up in nearby [[Royston, South Yorkshire|Royston]]. As a child, he was a season-ticket holder at the [[Barnsley F.C.|town's football club]], along with his grandfather.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/sport/3765151.how-can-booing-a-player-help-your-team/ |title=How can booing a player help your team? |first=Paul |last=Heckingbottom |newspaper=Telegraph & Argus |location=Bradford |date=16 October 2008 |access-date=15 April 2021}}</ref> He started his football career at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as a trainee, but joined [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in 1995 after failing to gain a professional contract. He had loan spells at [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]], [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] and [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]], without featuring for Sunderland, before joining Darlington permanently in 1999. He made 126 appearances, scoring 6 goals, before catching the attention of [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], who signed him in 2002 on a three-year contract.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/2090263.stm |title=Norwich sign Quakers defender |website=BBC Sport |date=4 July 2002 |access-date=8 January 2010}}</ref>

Heckingbottom made just 16 appearances for Norwich, including only 7 starts, resulting in him cancelling his contract with the club by mutual consent after just one year.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/3043918.stm |title=Defender's Norwich regret |website=BBC Sport |date=4 July 2003 |access-date=8 January 2010}}</ref> He subsequently signed for [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] in July 2003, and was named their Player of the Year at the end of his first season.<ref name="mccall awaiting">{{cite news |url=https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/sport/1941124.mccall-awaiting-defenders-answer/ |title=McCall awaiting defender's answer |first=Simon |last=Parker |newspaper=Telegraph & Argus |location=Bradford |date=3 January 2008 |access-date=15 April 2021}}</ref> Bradford, however, were relegated to [[EFL League One|League One]] at the end of the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]] season, and Heckingbottom left to join [[EFL League One|League One]] club [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] during the close season.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_wed/3737719.stm |title=Double signing for Owls |website=BBC Sport |date=21 May 2004 |access-date=8 January 2010}}</ref>

===Sheffield Wednesday===
Heckingbottom was well favoured under both Wednesday managers [[Chris Turner (footballer, born 1958)|Chris Turner]] and [[Paul Sturrock]], making a total of 41 appearances at left back in his first season – more than any other player that year. He also scored four goals, helping the Owls to promotion to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] via the [[2005 Football League One play-off final|play-off final]] at the end of the [[2004–05 Football League|2004–05]] season. Due to an injury sustained in pre-season he was put out of contention for the first 16 games of the [[2005–06 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season|2005–06 season]]. When he returned to fitness, new signing [[John Hills (footballer)|John Hills]] had begun to make the left back spot his own. An injury to Hills left Heckingbottom able to re-stake his claim on the team, but he only managed a 4-game streak before once again succumbing to injury, this time [[Peter Gilbert (Welsh footballer)|Peter Gilbert]] taking his place in the squad. Sturrock allowed Heckingbottom a chance to prove himself in an [[FA Cup]] Third Round game against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. He scored both of Wednesday's goals in the 4–2 defeat at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]], though this was not enough to establish himself as the club's first-choice left back.

===Barnsley===
On 13 January 2006, Heckingbottom was sent on [[loan (association football)|loan]], with a view to a permanent move, to his boyhood club [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/barnsley/4610988.stm |title=Heckingbottom seals Barnsley move |website=BBC Sport |date=13 January 2006 |access-date=20 January 2008}}</ref> He played an important part in the club's promotion campaign and win over [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in the League One play-off final, scoring in the 4–3 [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] victory that secured their promotion to the Championship. Heckingbottom played in 31 games for Barnsley the [[2006–07 in English football|next season]], as they comfortably avoided relegation. He scored once during his spell at Barnsley, in a 1–0 win over [[Tranmere Rovers]] on 18 February 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_2/4703888.stm |title=Tranmere 0–1 Barnsley |website=BBC Sport |date=18 February 2006 |access-date=10 February 2013}}</ref>

===Bradford City===
In July 2007, Heckingbottom returned to [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] on loan until 1 January 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bradford_city/6900808.stm |title=Heckingbottom seals Bradford move |website=BBC Sport |date=16 July 2007 |access-date=8 January 2008}}</ref> He played in all 23 league games during his loan spell, missing only an FA Cup tie against Tranmere Rovers through suspension following a red card in a 1–1 draw with [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]].<ref name="mccall awaiting"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_3/7099922.stm |title=Bradford 1–1 Stockport |website=BBC Sport |date=24 November 2007 |access-date=8 January 2008}}</ref> A week after his loan deal expired, his contract at Barnsley was cancelled by mutual consent and he signed a permanent 18-month deal at Bradford City.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/bradford_city/7176638.stm |title=Heckingbottom seals Bradford move |website=BBC Sport |date=8 January 2008 |access-date=8 January 2008}}</ref> He missed his first league game of the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08]] season with four games left, when an ankle injury prevented him from playing against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] on 12 April 2008. Heckingbottom's place was taken by [[Luke O'Brien]], who made his Bradford debut in a 2–2 draw.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/sport/2198856.heckys-helping-hand-for-obrien/ |title=Hecky's helping hand for O'Brien |first=Simon |last=Parker |newspaper=Telegraph & Argus |location=Bradford |date=15 April 2008 |access-date=15 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/7332194.stm |title=Brentford 2–2 Bradford |website=BBC Sport |date=12 April 2008 |access-date=17 April 2008}}</ref>

He played in the club's first nine league games of the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09]] season, but was sent off in a 1–1 draw with [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] for two bookable offences.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_3/7639320.stm |title=Bradford 1–1 Luton |website=BBC Sport |date=4 October 2008 |access-date=4 October 2008}}</ref> His place was again taken by youngster O'Brien, and although Heckingbottom returned for an FA Cup game against [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]], he suffered [[tendonitis]] which kept him out for five months.<ref name=sb0809/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/yorkshire-soccer/BRADFORD-CITY-Injury-giving-Heck39.5096432.jp |title=Bradford City: Injury giving Heck' the needle |first=Lee |last=Sobot |newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post |date=22 March 2009 |access-date=22 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328064444/http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/yorkshire-soccer/BRADFORD-CITY-Injury-giving-Heck39.5096432.jp |archive-date=28 March 2009}}</ref> Bradford opted against offering Heckingbottom a contract extension, and he left the club in May 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10266~1660579,00.html |title=Paul Heckingbottom determined to bounce back |publisher=Bradford City A.F.C. |date=18 May 2009 |access-date=8 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004034636/http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10266~1660579,00.html |archive-date=4 October 2011}}</ref>

== Managerial career ==

===Barnsley===
Heckingbottom took the opportunity to gain an academic understanding of football coaching, to set his CV apart from other managers competing for jobs. He completed his BSc (Hons) Sports Coaching at Leeds Metropolitan University in 2013, followed by an MSc in Sport Coaching in 2016, by which point the university had been renamed [[Leeds Beckett University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/alumni/alumni-profiles/2010-2017/paul-heckingbottom/ |title=Paul Heckingbottom– BSc (Hons) Sports Coaching, 2013 |publisher=Leeds Beckett University |access-date=5 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406040316/http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/alumni/alumni-profiles/2010-2017/paul-heckingbottom/ |archive-date=6 April 2018}}</ref>

He went on to work as a coach with professional club [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]'s development squad, and was appointed [[caretaker manager]] of the first team after [[Danny Wilson (footballer, born 1960)|Danny Wilson]] was sacked in 2015.
