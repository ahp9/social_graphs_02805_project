The [[2015–16 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2015–16]] season started well for Pardew – wins over teams such as Chelsea, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and Liverpool meant there was talk of a UEFA Europa League spot early in the campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34691262|title=Liverpool 1–2 Crystal Palace |first=Shamoon|last= Hafez |publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=8 May 2016 |date=8 November 2015}}</ref> After 19 games, the season's midpoint, Palace sat in fifth position in the Premier League, and looked well positioned to challenge for said European spot going into the New Year of 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/35148138|title=Crystal Palace 0–0 Swansea City|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 December 2015}}</ref>

However, this target would ultimately not be reached, as Palace made a dismal start to 2016. They embarked on a 14-game winless run, which came to a halt with a 1–0 win over [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35949245|title=Crystal Palace 1–0 Norwich City|last=Magowan|first=Alistair |publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=8 May 2016|date=9 April 2016}}</ref> They would only win one other league game throughout the entire season – a 2–1 home victory over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on the penultimate match day of the season,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36176630|title=Crystal Palace 2–1 Stoke City|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 May 2016}}</ref> enough to keep the club in the division by finishing 15th. Despite the poor league form, Pardew and his team qualified for the [[2015–16 FA Cup]] [[2016 FA Cup Final|final]] after a 2–1 win over [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], thanks to goals from [[Yannick Bolasie]] and [[Connor Wickham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36065460|title=Crystal Palace 2–1 Watford|last=Johnston|first=Neil |publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=8 May 2016|date=24 April 2016}}</ref> They subsequently lost the cup final 2–1 to Manchester United.

After a poor start to the [[2016–17 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2016–17 season]], and poor results overall in the 2016 calendar year, Pardew was dismissed as manager on 22 December 2016; Palace had won only six matches of 36 played in 2016.<ref name="CPFC2016">{{Cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11706/10705128/palace-sack-pardew |title=Alan Pardew sacked as Crystal Palace manager |last=Lustig |first=Nick|access-date=22 December 2016 |date=22 December 2016 |publisher=Sky Sports}}</ref> They had won one in eleven, and were placed 17th in the [[2016–17 Premier League|Premier League table]] at the time of his dismissal.

On 29 November 2017, Pardew was appointed as the new manager of Premier League club West Bromwich Albion, replacing the dismissed [[Tony Pulis]], signing a contract lasting until the end of the 2019–20 season. "I'm thrilled with the opportunity to work with a talented group", he said. "The immediate challenge will be to get the results we need to pull ourselves up the table. But I'm aware that while I'm joining one of the great, traditional clubs of English football, it is one determined to go forward in the Premier League." John Carver joined the coaching staff as assistant manager, having previously worked under Pardew at Newcastle United.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wba.co.uk/news/2017/november/albion-appoint-alan-pardew/|title=Albion Appoint Alan Pardew|publisher=West Bromwich Albion|date=29 November 2017}}</ref> In his debut game in charge, the club drew 0–0 at [[The Hawthorns]], against his previous club Crystal Palace.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42119950|title=West Bromwich Albion 0–0 Crystal Palace|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=3 December 2017|date=2 December 2017}}</ref>

==Controversies==
{{Criticism section|date=April 2025}}
Pardew has been involved in several controversial issues and events during his managerial career which are listed below:
* In September 2003, Pardew resigned from Reading after being refused permission to become manager at West Ham. Reading's chairman [[John Madejski]] attempted to create an [[injunction]] in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] to prevent him from moving to West Ham. Eventually Reading's legal action was dropped, and Pardew joined West Ham after a period of [[gardening leave]].<ref name="Pardew free to join West Ham"/>
* In March 2006, Pardew had a dispute with Arsenal manager [[Arsène Wenger]], after he criticised Arsenal for failing to field an English player in their [[UEFA Champions League]] win against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].<ref>{{Cite news| title = Pardew questions Arsenal policy| publisher = BBC Sport| access-date =16 November 2007| date = 10 March 2006| url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4792270.stm}}</ref> Wenger suggested that Pardew was being [[xenophobic]],<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4793868.stm| title = Dein backs Wenger foreign policy| publisher = BBC Sport| access-date =16 November 2007| date = 11 March 2006}}</ref> a claim Pardew denied, citing his marriage to a Swedish woman.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Pardew insists he is not a racist| publisher = BBC Sport| access-date =16 November 2007| date = 13 March 2006| url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/4802644.stm}}</ref>

* On the opening day of the 2012–13 Premier League season against Tottenham Hotspur, Pardew pushed an official after an incident in which the ball appeared to go over the touchline, but the referee deemed it to still be in play. Pardew later apologised, citing his behaviour as "ridiculous".<ref name="linopush">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/19308495 | title=Alan Pardew sorry for push on assistant referee | publisher=BBC Sport | access-date=12 March 2014}}</ref>
* In January 2014, during the Premier League match against Manchester City, Pardew verbally abused opposition manager [[Manuel Pellegrini]]. Pellegrini initially confronted Pardew on the touchline and accused Pardew of frivolously contesting every decision by the referee and was trying to dishonestly deceive the officials even when it was an obvious decision in City's favour. After the initial skirmish, Pardew was caught on Sky Sports television cameras calling Pellegrini "a fucking old cunt". Pardew later apologised only after being confronted by journalists about his abusive language.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Newcastle's Alan Pardew apologises for insulting City's Pellegrini |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jan/12/newcastle-united-alan-pardew-apologises-manchester-city-manuel-pellegrini |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=12 January 2014 |access-date=14 January 2014}}</ref> Pellegrini shrugged off the incident but said he disagreed with Pardew's approach to contesting every decision by the referee.<ref name="pellipardew">{{cite news | url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11679/9113948/premier-league-manchester-city-boss-manuel-pellegrini-plays-down-alan-pardew-spat | title=Premier League: Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini plays down Alan Pardew spat | publisher=Sky Sports | date=13 January 2014 | access-date=12 March 2014}}</ref>
* In March 2014, Pardew was sent to the [[Grandstand|stands]] after [[headbutt]]ing Hull City player [[David Meyler]]. The ball went out of play near Pardew and Meyler pushed past him to quickly resume play, at which point Pardew headbutted Meyler. Although Pardew apologised for his actions, he was fined £100,000 by Newcastle United and given a formal warning.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/26402044 | title=Alan Pardew headbutt: Newcastle boss fined £100,000 by Magpies | publisher=BBC Sport | access-date=2 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/26300992 | title=Hull City 1–4 Newcastle United | publisher=BBC Sport | date=1 March 2014 | access-date=2 March 2014}}</ref> On 11 March, the FA handed Pardew a three-game stadium ban with a touchline ban for a further four games. He was also fined £60,000 by the FA, in addition to the £100,000 fine from Newcastle United.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1224195/pardew-banned-for-seven-matches-for-headbutt| title= Pardew Banned for Seven Matches for Headbutt| publisher=Sky News| date=11 March 2014| access-date=11 March 2014}}</ref>
