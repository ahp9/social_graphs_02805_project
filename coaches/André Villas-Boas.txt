==Early life and career==
Born in [[Porto]], Portugal,{{citation needed|date=July 2025}} Villas-Boas is the second child and first son of Luís Filipe Manuel Henrique do Vale Peixoto de Sousa e Villas-Boas (born 29 February 1952) and Teresa Maria de Pina Cabral e Silva (born 11 February 1951),<ref name="geneall1"/> and is also the great-grandson of Dom José Gerardo Coelho Vieira Pinto do Vale Peixoto de Vilas-Boas, 1st Viscount of Guilhomil.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://geneall.net/pt/nome/40344/jose-geraldo-coelho-vieira-do-vale-peixoto-de-sousa-e-vilas-boas/ |title=José Geraldo Coelho Vieira do Vale Peixoto de Sousa e Vilas-Boas, * 1863 &#124; Geneall.net |website=geneall.net |access-date=2 January 2020}}</ref> He has spoken fluent English since childhood, for his grandmother who was from [[Stockport]], England.<ref name="bobby robson"/> At the age of 16, Villas-Boas found himself living in the same apartment block as [[Bobby Robson]], who was then manager of [[FC Porto|Porto]]. Following a conversation between the two, Robson appointed him to Porto's observation department.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1306459.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926174918/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1306459.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 September 2010 |title=Novice delighting in the Dragao dugout |publisher=FIFA |date=23 September 2010 |access-date=22 June 2011}}</ref> 

Robson arranged for Villas-Boas to obtain [[the Football Association|the FA]] coaching qualification, the UEFA C coaching licence in Scotland and for him to study the training methods of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].<ref name="bobby robson">{{cite news |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/porto-boss-andrea-villas-boas-says-1397951 |title=Porto boss Andrea Villas-Boas says Sir Bobby Robson was his inspiration |newspaper=Sunday Sun |date=17 April 2011 |access-date=26 June 2014 |first=Roger |last=Domeneghetti}}</ref><ref name="largs mafia">{{cite news |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport/Another-feather-in-development-director.6789738.jp |title=Another feather in development director Fleeting's cap as Largs coaching class proves its value again |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=23 June 2011 |access-date=3 October 2011 |first=Alan |last=Pattullo}}</ref> He obtained his C licence at the age of 17, and his B licence at 18.

As Mourinho moved clubs to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]], he followed.<ref name="uefa" />

==Coaching career==
===Académica===
At the start of the 2009–10 season, Villas-Boas left Mourinho's team to pursue a career as a manager, and he soon found a job in the [[Primeira Liga]] with [[Associação Académica de Coimbra&nbsp;– O.A.F.|Académica de Coimbra]], filling a vacancy created by [[Rogério Gonçalves]]' resignation in October 2009.<ref name="uefa" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.portugoal.net/index.php/more-academica-news/4682-andre-villas-boas-new-academica-boss |title=Academica appoint Andre Villas-Boas as head coach |publisher=PortuGOAL.net |access-date=18 December 2010 |date=14 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804173025/http://www.portugoal.net/index.php/more-academica-news/4682-andre-villas-boas-new-academica-boss |archive-date=4 August 2010}}</ref> At the time of his appointment, Académica was at the bottom of the league and still without any wins, but the team's luck started to change as he introduced a new style, leading them to a safe 11th place, ten points clear of the relegation zone. In addition to that, Académica also reached the [[2009–10 Taça da Liga|2009–10 Portuguese League Cup]] semi-finals, losing against Porto at the [[Estádio do Dragão]] to a late goal from [[Mariano González]]. His impact at Académica was immediate, not only because of solid results, but also because of the attractive football displayed by the team, which led to intense media speculation linking him with the vacant jobs at [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting CP]] and Porto in the summer of 2010.<ref name="uefa" />

===Porto===
[[File:Villas-Boas.JPG|thumb|upright|Villas-Boas as manager of [[FC Porto|Porto]] in 2011]]
Villas-Boas signed a deal to become the new manager of Porto on 2 June 2010.<ref name="uefa" /> Two months later, he won his first trophy as a manager when Porto defeated [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] 2–0 to win the [[Portuguese Supercup]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/407902/Live |title=His first trophy in Porto, Porto 2–0 Benfica |publisher=Whoscored.com}}</ref> Villas-Boas went on to immense success with Porto, leading the team to an [[2010–11 Primeira Liga|undefeated season in the Primeira Liga]]—only the second time this had ever been achieved—and winning the title by more than 20 points, having conceded only 13 goals all season. Villas-Boas went on to follow up this success by leading Porto to win both the [[2010–11 Taça de Portugal|Portuguese Cup]] and the [[2010–11 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]], thus completing a [[Treble (association football)|treble]] in his first season in charge. By doing so, Villas-Boas became the third-youngest coach ever to win the Primeira Liga (behind Mihály Siska in [[1938–39 Primeira Liga|1939]] and [[Juca]] in [[1961–62 Primeira Liga|1962]]) and the youngest manager ever to win a European competition, at the age of 33 years and 213 days.<ref name="soccernet.espn.go.com"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/423279/Live |title=Champions of Liga Sagres,2010–11, Benfica 1–2 Porto |publisher=Whoscored.com}}</ref> On 21 June 2011, Villas-Boas tendered his resignation as Porto manager.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/929431/porto%27s-andre-villas-boas-hands-in-resignation-for-chelsea-move?cc=5739 |title=Villas-Boas resigns from Porto |date=21 June 2011 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |access-date=21 June 2011 |archive-date=24 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624234853/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/929431/porto%27s-andre-villas-boas-hands-in-resignation-for-chelsea-move?cc=5739 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Chelsea===
[[File:Avb2.jpg|thumb|upright|Villas-Boas managing [[Chelsea Football Club|Chelsea]] in 2012]]
Chelsea confirmed the appointment of André Villas-Boas as its new manager on a three-year contract with immediate effect on 22 June 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jun/22/chelsea-confirm-andre-villas-boas |title=Chelsea appoint former Porto coach André Villas-Boas on three-year deal |date=22 June 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=22 June 2011 |location=London |first=Paul |last=Doyle}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2380210 |title=Villas-Boas appointed |publisher=Chelsea F.C |access-date=26 June 2014}}</ref> It indirectly paid Porto [[List of most expensive association football transfers#Managers|a world record]] [[Euro|€]]15{{nbsp}}million ([[Pound sterling|£]]13.3{{nbsp}}million) compensation via Villas-Boas to activate his release clause and free him from his contract with Porto.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chelsea close on Villas-Boas |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11668_6999591,00.html |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |access-date=22 June 2011}}</ref> He won all of his pre-season fixtures with Chelsea, the team conceding only one goal in all six games. On 14 August, his first [[Premier League]] match ended in a 0–0 draw at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], with Villas-Boas commenting on Stoke's strong defence at home. He then won his first competitive match as Chelsea manager, defeating [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] 2–1 on 20 August. He continued his season with a home win, beating [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] 3–1. On 18 September 2011, Villas-Boas's Chelsea lost to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 3–1 at [[Old Trafford]]. It was Chelsea's first defeat of the season and Villas-Boas's first defeat in 39 league matches, a run stretching back to his spells as manager of Académica and Porto. On 29 October, Chelsea lost the [[Arsenal F.C.–Chelsea F.C. rivalry|derby]] in a 5–3 defeat at home to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] after falling to a 1–0 defeat to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. Then three weeks later, his Chelsea side lost a second successive home game in a 2–1 defeat to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. Days later, he once again lost to Liverpool in a 2–0 defeat in the [[2011–12 Football League Cup|League Cup]] quarter-final.

On 11 February 2012, pressure began to mount on Villas-Boas as Chelsea dropped out of the top four in the Premier League following a 2–0 league defeat against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. Villas-Boas responded by cancelling his squad's day off and called them in for an inquest, which provoked several senior players to question his tactics in front of owner [[Roman Abramovich]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://sg.sports.yahoo.com/news/five-matches-led-villas-boass-dismissal-175352111--soccer.html |title=Five matches that led to Villas-Boas's dismissal |publisher=AFP News |access-date=4 March 2012}}</ref> On 21 February 2012, during a [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] match against [[S.S.C.

On the Chelsea website, it read, "The board would like to record our gratitude for his work and express our disappointment that the relationship has ended so early."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2633044 |title=Chelsea and AVB part company |publisher=Chelsea F.C |access-date=26 June 2014}}</ref>

===Tottenham Hotspur===
[[File:Andre Villas Boas 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|Villas-Boas managing [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in 2013]]
On 3 July 2012, it was announced that Villas-Boas had been named [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] head coach after successful talks with the club, replacing [[Harry Redknapp]] and signing a three-year deal with the North London football team.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/03/tottenham-andre-villas-boas-manager?newsfeed=true |title=André Villas-Boas starts life at Spurs by targeting João Moutinho |date=4 July 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=4 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18610066 |title=Andre Villas-Boas: Tottenham name Portuguese as new manager |date=4 July 2012 |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=4 July 2012}}</ref> Villas-Boas' first competitive game in charge of Tottenham came on 18 August 2012 in the opening day of the [[2012–13 Premier League|Premier League]] season, losing 2–1 to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] away from home.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19221418 |title=Newcastle 2–1 Tottenham |date=18 August 2012 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> His first competitive win came on 16 September 2012, a 3–1 victory away to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19491534 |title=Reading 1–3 Tottenham |date=16 September 2012 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

On 29 September 2012, Villas-Boas became the first Tottenham manager to win at [[Old Trafford]] in 23 years after his side beat [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 3–2.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19774394 |title=Andre Villas-Boas savours historic Tottenham win |date=29 September 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=29 September 2012}}</ref> Villas-Boas took charge of his first [[North London derby]] against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 17 November 2012 at the [[Emirates Stadium]]. Despite taking the lead early on, goalscorer [[Emmanuel Adebayor]] was sent off just eight minutes later, and Tottenham eventually lost 5–2.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20278355 |title=Arsenal 5–2 Tottenham |date=17 November 2012 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>
Villas-Boas earned his first piece of personal Tottenham silverware when he won the Manager of the Month award for December. The team managed to pick up vital points in order to pursue their top four ambition. Promising big scorelines away from home such as against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] along with home wins against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and Reading, left Tottenham in third place going into the new year. One set back was a tough trip to [[Goodison Park]], where Spurs were leading up until the 90th minute, before two late [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] goals in as many minutes, snatched victory away from the North London side.

In February 2013, he guided Tottenham to the last 16 of the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] after a last minute goal from [[Mousa Dembélé (Belgian footballer)|Mousa Dembélé]], securing a 1–1 draw against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] at the [[Stade Gerland]]. Spurs won the tie 3–2 on aggregate, after a 2–1 win at home the previous week. Following a 3–2 away win at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], Tottenham's third win from three Premier League matches that month, Villas-Boas picked up his second piece of personal Tottenham silverware of the season as he was awarded the Manager of the Month award for February, along with [[Gareth Bale]] who picked up the Player of the Month award for February as well.<ref name="manager-month-feb13">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21632265 |title=Gareth Bale & Andre Villas-Boas earn player and manager awards. |publisher=BBC Sport |work=bbc.co.uk |date=1 March 2013 |access-date=1 March 2013}}</ref>

On the final day of the Premier League season, Tottenham sat a point behind [[North London derby|North London rivals]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], knowing that in order to qualify for the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|2013–14 Champions League]], they had to win and hope that Arsenal failed to win. Tottenham won against Sunderland, but did not qualify due to Arsenal's 0–1 win at Newcastle United. Even though Tottenham finished a point behind the Champions League playoff spot, they set a new club record by finishing with 72 points.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/19/tottenham-hotspur-sunderland-premier-league |title=Tottenham miss out on top-four spot despite Gareth Bale's screamer |first=David |last=Hynter |work=The Guardian |date=19 May 2013 |access-date=27 June 2014}}</ref> This was also the highest points tally ever achieved by any club in the Premier League to consequently not finish in the top four, until Arsenal finishing in fifth with 75 points in [[2016–17 Premier League|2016-17]].

===Zenit Saint Petersburg===
[[File:Torino-Zenit (19).jpg|thumb|upright|Villas-Boas managing [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit]] in 2015]]

On 18 March 2014, Villas-Boas signed a two-year deal with [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit Saint Petersburg]], replacing [[Luciano Spalletti]], and took the reins the day after the club's [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] round of 16 second leg against [[Borussia Dortmund]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Andre Villas-Boas agrees deal to manage Zenit St Petersburg |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/26625324 |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=18 March 2014 |date=18 March 2014}}</ref> A month later, he went on to become the first coach in [[Russian Premier League]] history to win his first six matches in charge.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://en.fc-zenit.ru/main/news/58534.html |title=Villas-Boas sets new Russian coaching record |date=26 April 2014 |access-date=29 April 2014 |work=Футбольный клуб Зенит}}</ref> He continued to pursue the title but on 3 May, Zenit lost their first points in a 1–1 away draw with [[Lokomotiv Moscow]] being followed by a 2–4 loss at home to [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]] which dictated the league advantage to [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]]. In the final fixture of the Russian Premier League on 16 May, Zenit won 4–1 away against [[FC Kuban Krasnodar|Kuban Krasnodar]] but it was not enough to win the title, as CSKA defeated Lokomotiv and were crowned champions one point ahead of Zenit. However, the St. Petersburg club clinched a place in the [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League|2014–15 UEFA Champions League Third qualifying round]].

In the [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League|2014–15 season]], Zenit qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stage by beating [[AEL Limassol]] in the third round qualification and [[Standard Liège]] in the playoffs. On 17 May 2015, Villas-Boas led the club to the fifth [[2014–15 Russian Premier League|league title]] in its history, clinching it after a 1–1 draw against [[FC Ufa|Ufa]] with two games left to play.

On 10 September 2015, Villas-Boas announced he would return to Portugal because of his family and therefore be leaving Zenit at the end of the [[2015–16 Russian Premier League|2015–16 season]] after turning down a contract extension.<ref>{{cite web |title=Andre Villas-Boas to quit as Zenit St Petersburg coach in May |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11945/9985163/andre-villas-boas-to-quit-as-zenit-st-petersburg-coach-in-may |publisher=Sky Sports |access-date=10 September 2015 |date=10 September 2015}}</ref> In the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League|2015–16 Champions League]] Zenit finished top of the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group H|Group H]], being eliminated by Benfica in the Round of 16.

=== Shanghai SIPG ===
On 4 November 2016, Villas-Boas became the manager of [[Shanghai SIPG F.C.|Shanghai SIPG]], replacing [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] for the [[Chinese Super League]] club.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/sven-goran-eriksson-leaves-shanghai-sipg-football-club-042813171.html |title=Villas-Boas replaces Eriksson at Shanghai SIPG football club |agency=AFP |date=4 November 2016}}</ref> Despite not being able to win any major silverware during his stint at the club, Villas-Boas has been credited with turning a relatively inexperienced side into a true championship contender. Bolstered by the talents of Brazilians [[Hulk (footballer)|Hulk]] and [[Oscar (footballer, born 1991)|Oscar]] as well as star Chinese attacker [[Wu Lei]], his only season at the helm saw SIPG finish second in the league, losing to rivals Shanghai Shenhua in the final of the Chinese FA cup, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Asian Champions League, the club's best result in the competition to date (as of November 2019).

Villas-Boas' stint at SIPG was also marred by a number of controversial remarks he made throughout the campaign, some of which were in response to star midfielder Oscar's controversial 8-match suspension for kicking the ball at an opponent during play.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://m.sohu.com/n/498225792/?wscrid=95360_1 |title=上港外援奥斯卡被停赛八场 |newspaper=Sohu |access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref> He also repeatedly lambasted match officials for favouring eventual league champions [[Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao F.C.|Guangzhou Evergrande]], notably following a game between Guangzhou and [[Yanbian Funde F.C.|Yanbian Funde]] where Guangzhou defender [[Liu Jian (footballer)|Liu Jian]] scored following a handball gifting Guangzhou a crucial victory.

On 28 May 2019, Villas-Boas signed a two-year contract to be the new manager of [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], replacing [[Rudi Garcia]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/48436194 |title=Andre Villas-Boas appointed Marseille head coach |work=BBC |date=28 May 2019}}</ref>

== President of FC Porto ==
After he left Marseille, Villas-Boas decided to end his managerial career and retired from football management altogether. Sometime during 2022, Villas-Boas revealed the reason he gave up his coaching career was to focus on his candidacy as Porto president.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ojogo.pt/8127901746/villas-boas-abandonei-a-carreira-de-treinador-ha-dois-anos-para-montar-uma-alternativa-consistente|language=PT|title=Villas-Boas: "Abandonei a carreira de treinador há dois anos para montar uma alternativa consistente"|trans-title=Villas-Boas: "I gave up my coaching career two years ago to set up a consistent alternative"|website=O Jogo|date=15 March 2024|access-date=27 April 2024}}</ref>

In the elections held on 27 April 2024, he defeated the sitting president, [[Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa]], who left office after holding the position for 42 consecutive years. Villas-Boas' candidacy was the most voted in the club's elections, held at the Estádio do Dragão, with 21,489 of the 26,876 votes cast, compared to 5,224 from Pinto da Costa's list and 53 from Nuno Lobo's.
