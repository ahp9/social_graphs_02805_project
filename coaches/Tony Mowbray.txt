'''Anthony Mark Mowbray''' (born 22 November 1963) is an English football manager and former [[Association football|footballer]] who was most recently the manager of [[EFL Championship]] club [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]. Mowbray played for [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]].

He began his coaching career with Ipswich Town and took his first managerial job at [[Scottish Premier League]] side [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], where he won the [[Scottish Football Writers' Association]] Manager of the Year award in his first season. He moved on to West Bromwich Albion in 2006, where he won the [[Football League Championship]] in 2008, but then suffered relegation from the [[Premier League]] the following year. Mowbray was then appointed as manager of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], but was dismissed after nine months for poor results.

Mowbray subsequently took the manager's role at another of his former clubs, Middlesbrough.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tony Mowbray appointed new Middlesbrough manager |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/middlesbrough/8087553/Tony-Mowbray-appointed-new-Middlesbrough-manager.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/middlesbrough/8087553/Tony-Mowbray-appointed-new-Middlesbrough-manager.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=26 October 2010 |location=London |access-date=5 April 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref> After a poor start to the 2013–14 season, Mowbray left Middlesbrough in October 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0,,1~3505015,00.html |title=Tony Mowbray leaves Boro |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C. |access-date=21 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024081843/http://www.mfc.co.uk/page/news/latest/0%2C%2C1~3505015%2C00.html |archive-date=24 October 2013}}</ref> After a spell with [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], he was appointed [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] manager in February 2017. He was unable to prevent Rovers being relegated to League One, but then won promotion back to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] at the first attempt.

==Playing career==

===Middlesbrough===
After playing his first match for the club in 1982, Mowbray became captain of Middlesbrough in [[1986–87 Middlesbrough F.C. season|1986]] when he was just 22 years old. Affectionately known to Boro fans as "Mogga", Mowbray became a legend in Middlesbrough for being a [[Saltburn-by-the-Sea|local lad]] who led the club from [[Middlesbrough F.C. survival from liquidation|liquidation]] back into the top league of English football within two seasons.

In 2007, Mowbray was placed at number 7 in a chronological list of Middlesbrough legends<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/boro-fc/boro-legends/|title=Boro Legends|date=23 January 2008|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123154521/http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/boro-fc/boro-legends/|archive-date=23 January 2008}}</ref> compiled by local newspaper the ''Evening Gazette''. The Middlesbrough club fanzine ''Fly Me to the Moon'' is named after a quote about Mowbray from ex-Middlesbrough manager [[Bruce Rioch]] – "If I had to fly to the moon I'd take Tony Mowbray, my captain, with me. He's a magnificent man". In 1991, after 348 appearances for ''Boro'', Mowbray moved to Scottish club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] for £1 million.

===Celtic===
During his playing career with Celtic, Mowbray's wife Bernadette, a native of [[Renfrewshire]], died of breast cancer. The episode is recalled in Mowbray's book, ''Kissed by an Angel''. It is often asserted that the "huddle" which Celtic players still perform before each match was arranged as a tribute to Bernadette.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/midlands-birmingham-sport/west-midlands-sports/2006/10/14/shaped-by-passion-and-grief-65233-17940375|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120720194704/http://www.birminghampost.net/midlands-birmingham-sport/west-midlands-sports/2006/10/14/shaped-by-passion-and-grief-65233-17940375|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 July 2012|title=Shaped by passion and grief|work=[[Birmingham Post]]|last=Jawad|first=Hyder|date=14 October 2006|access-date=1 March 2010}}</ref> However, it was merely suggested by Mowbray on a pre-season tour of Germany to bring the squad together at a time of uncertainty. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

===Ipswich Town===
He later moved on to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], where he played for five years, becoming the team captain. He scored an equalising goal in the 2000 Division One playoff final victory against [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. Ipswich won the match 4–2 and secured promotion to [[the Football Association|the FA]] [[Premier League]]. This match was both Mowbray's Wembley debut and the last of his playing career.

==Coaching career==
Once his playing career finished, he moved into coaching, starting as a first-team coach at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. He had a brief spell as caretaker manager of Ipswich, following the sacking of [[George Burley]] and prior to the appointment of [[Joe Royle]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Christopher|title=Mowbray holds fort after Burley goes|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2002/10/12/sfnips12.xml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118224843/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2002/10/12/sfnips12.xml|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 January 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=11 October 2002|access-date=15 January 2008|location=London}}</ref>

===Hibernian===
In May 2004, Mowbray was appointed manager of [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], replacing [[Bobby Williamson]].<ref>{{cite news|date=24 May 2004|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/3741809.stm|title=Mowbray is new Hibs boss|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=14 August 2007}}</ref> He gained much acclaim for the job he did, winning the [[Scottish Football Writers' Association]] manager of the year award in his first season.<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/4505709.stm Hartson wins writers' top prize], BBC Sport, 2 May 2005</ref> Hibs finished in the top four in the SPL in his only two full seasons in charge, which was the first time since [[Eddie Turnbull]]'s time as manager that the club had done this in the top division in consecutive seasons.

The Hibs team progressed to the later stages of every domestic cup competition during his tenure, and made two appearances in European football. They lost heavily to [[FC Dnipro|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] in the first round of the [[2005–06 UEFA Cup]] and on the [[away goals rule]] to [[OB Odense]] in the [[2006 Intertoto Cup]]. During mid-2006 Mowbray was interviewed for the vacant managerial position at Ipswich Town, but he rejected this approach.<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/4985882.stm Mowbray rejects Ipswich approach], BBC Sport, 19 May 2006</ref> In September 2006 he signed a 12-month rolling deal with Hibs that was due to take effect from July 2007.<ref>{{cite news|date=7 September 2006|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/5323912.stm|title=New Hibs deal for manager Mowbray|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=14 August 2007}}</ref> Just one month later, however, Mowbray moved to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].

===West Bromwich Albion===
West Bromwich Albion appointed Mowbray as its manager on 13 October 2006.<ref name="wba appt">{{cite news |date=13 October 2006 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_bromwich_albion/6043410.stm |title=Mowbray leaves Hibs for West Brom |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=9 January 2014}}</ref> Mowbray faced the task of returning the Baggies to the [[Premier League]] after relegation the previous season.<ref name="wba appt"/> Although he managed to turn around the club's poor away form, an indifferent run of results at home towards the end of the season meant that Albion finished fourth in The Championship table behind [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], and faced the lottery of the [[EFL Championship play-offs|Championship play-offs]]. Despite two famous victories over old rivals [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the semi-finals, Albion lost 1–0 to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in the [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] final.

As a result, during the close season, Mowbray set about restructuring his squad, moving out several of Robson's players for multimillion-pound fees, after press reports of dressing room division.<ref>[https://www.expressandstar.com/2007/09/12/boss-i-had-to-clear-decks/ Boss: I had to clear decks] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118170340/http://www.expressandstar.com/2007/09/12/boss-i-had-to-clear-decks|date=18 January 2008}} ''Express & Star'', 12 September 2007.</ref>

High-profile players such as [[Jason Koumas]], [[Diomansy Kamara]] and [[Curtis Davies]] were sold to Premier League clubs for large fees, in addition to the departures of [[Paul McShane (footballer)|Paul McShane]], [[Nathan Ellington]], [[Darren Carter]] and [[Steve Watson]]. Mowbray replaced them by signing a total of 14 permanent and loan players in the summer transfer window, making an overall profit in the process. His most expensive signings were [[Chris Brunt]] from [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] for £3 million,<ref>{{cite news |date=2007-08-15 |title=West Brom complete £3m Brunt deal |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_bromwich_albion/6945739.stm |access-date=2024-02-29 |language=en-GB}}</ref> [[Leon Barnett]] from [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] for £2.5 million,<ref>{{cite news |date=2007-07-26 |title=Barnett completes West Brom move |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_bromwich_albion/6914541.stm |access-date=2024-02-29 |language=en-GB}}</ref> and [[James Morrison (footballer)|James Morrison]] from Middlesbrough for £1.5 million.<ref>{{cite news |date=2007-08-07 |title=Morrison secures move to Baggies |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_bromwich_albion/6932011.stm |access-date=2024-02-29 |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Despite the large changes in his squad, Mowbray won the [[EFL Championship Manager of the Month|Championship Manager of the Month award]] in September 2007, after Albion gained 13 out of the maximum 15 points and climbed to second in the Division.<ref>{{cite news|date=4 October 2007|url=http://www.wba.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/0,,10366~1127177,00.html|title=Mowbray wins award|publisher=West Bromwich Albion FC|access-date=4 October 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118083252/http://www.wba.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10366~1127177%2C00.html|archive-date=18 January 2008}}</ref>

At the start of 2008, Mowbray's young Albion team topped the table, receiving growing plaudits from the media<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/coca_cola/article3286759.ece|work=The Independent|title=West Bromwich Albion 4 Bristol City 1: Bednar fires Albion to the summit|first=Jon|last=Culley|date=27 December 2007|access-date=25 May 2010|location=London|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230150220/http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/coca_cola/article3286759.ece|archive-date=30 December 2007}}</ref> and supporters alike for their attractive brand of attacking one touch passing football, a reflection of Mowbray's staunch footballing philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Mowbray guided West Brom to the [[EFL Championship]] title, meaning promotion to the [[2008–09 Premier League|Premier League]] and reached the semi-final of the [[2007–08 FA Cup|FA Cup]]. The semi-final, the first to be played at the new [[Wembley Stadium]], pitted West Brom against Portsmouth, the only remaining Premier League team left in the FA Cup. Portsmouth won the match 1–0 with the only goal of the game coming from Kanu. Mowbray won the Championship manager of the month award for April,<ref>{{cite news|title=Mowbray claims managerial award|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_bromwich_albion/7391042.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 May 2008|access-date=14 May 2008}}</ref> as well as the [[League Managers Association]] manager of the year award.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ferguson wins managerial honour|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/7397622.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 May 2008|access-date=14 May 2008}}</ref>

After a poor 2008–09 season, West Bromwich were relegated from the Premier League, finishing 20th. Mowbray was still thought highly of by the fans, however, and this was evidenced by them wearing Mowbray masks at their last game of the season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/west-bromwich-albion-fc/west-bromwich-albion-fc-news/2009/05/06/baggies-fans-plan-masked-tribute-to-tony-mowbray-97319-23556332|title=Baggies fans plan masked tribute to Tony Mowbray|work=[[Birmingham Mail]]|date=6 May 2009|access-date=9 June 2010|last=Montgomery|first=Ken}}</ref> Mowbray left the club for [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] shortly afterwards.

On 8 June 2009, it was reported that [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] had approached West Bromwich Albion for permission to speak to Mowbray about their managerial vacancy.<ref>{{cite news|title=Celtic make approach for Mowbray|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/8086779.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 June 2009|access-date=8 June 2009}}</ref> A compensation fee of £2 million was agreed, and Celtic declared Mowbray as their new manager on 16 June 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/8086779.stm|title=Mowbray confirmed as Celtic boss|date=16 June 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=16 June 2009}}</ref> He was unveiled as Celtic manager at a press conference a day later.

Mowbray decided to make significant changes to his squad during the January 2010 transfer window, selling [[Gary Caldwell]] and [[Barry Robson]], which apparently caused disruption to the team in the immediate aftermath of those deals being completed.<ref name="herald"/> [[Robbie Keane]] was recruited early in 2010 on a loan deal from Tottenham Hotspur amid great excitement; however, further poor results, particularly a record 4–0 defeat by [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]], led to Mowbray being sacked on 25 March.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/8586352.stm |title=Celtic part company with manager Tony Mowbray |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=25 March 2010 |access-date=25 March 2010}}</ref> It was reported in May 2010 that Celtic had yet to agree compensation with Mowbray and his management team.<ref>[http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_6168961,00.html LMA – Mowbray still waiting], Sky Sports, 23 May 2010.</ref>

===Middlesbrough===
Mowbray was appointed Middlesbrough manager on 26 October 2010, replacing [[Gordon Strachan]]. He lost his first match in charge, 2–1 against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Middlesbrough 1-2 Bristol City |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/9129352.stm |access-date=6 September 2020 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 October 2010}}</ref> but followed this with wins against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe]].

The club finished the season well, winning their last four league games and finished 12th in the league table. The same season, Mowbray started giving youngsters a first team place such as [[Joe Bennett (footballer)|Joe Bennett]], [[Luke Williams (footballer, born 1993)|Luke Williams]] and [[Richard Smallwood (footballer)|Richard Smallwood]]. Mowbray also started giving [[Marvin Emnes]] more playing time after returning on loan from [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
