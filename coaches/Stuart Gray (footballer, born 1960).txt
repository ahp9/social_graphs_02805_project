'''Stuart Gray''' (born 19 April 1960)<ref name = FATS/> is an English former professional footballer and manager he is the current assistant manager of [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. He has previously managed [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] as well as working as caretaker manager for a number of teams. He has been [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]'s defensive coach since 2016, in which time they have earned three promotions to the Premier League.

==Playing career==
Born in [[Withernsea]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]],<ref name = FATS/> Gray began his professional career with [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], emerging from the youth system with players such as [[Steve Hodge]] and [[Colin Walsh (footballer)|Colin Walsh]]. He joined [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] in 1984 and continued to build a reputation as a steady and versatile player, scoring eleven league goals in the [[1986–87 in English football|1986–87]] season. He moved to [[Aston Villa]] in 1987 and won promotion the following year and runners-up in the First Division in 1990.

Gray joined [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in September 1991 for a fee of £200,000 as one of [[Ian Branfoot]]'s first signings. Initially, this appeared to be a useful signing for the club as he could play either at left-back as cover for [[Micky Adams]] or in midfield, but a serious [[Achilles tendon]] injury sustained in an FA Cup match against former club Bolton Wanderers ended his playing career.<ref>{{cite book | first1=Duncan|last1= Holley |first2= Gary|last2= Chalk | title=In That Number - A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC  | publisher=Hagiology Publishing | year=2003| isbn=0-9534474-3-X|page=520}}</ref>

Earlier in that FA Cup run, Gray scored his only goal for Southampton, in a replay against [[Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford]]. Micky Adams hit a probing left-foot pass which dropped between [[Peter Schmeichel]] and [[Paul Parker (footballer)|Paul Parker]]. Gray nipped between the goalkeeper and defender to stroke the ball home from just outside the area. Southampton eventually went on to win the game in a [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty shoot-out]] after scores were level 2–2 after [[extra time]]. This was the first ever such shoot-out involving First Division sides.

==Coaching and management career==

===Southampton===
After his playing career was finished, Gray joined the coaching staff at [[The Dell (Southampton F.C.)|The Dell]] before moving to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in June 1994 as reserve team coach.<ref name="LMA">{{cite web |title=Stuart Gray |url=https://leaguemanagers.com/managers/stuart-gray/ |publisher=League Managers Association |access-date=8 July 2023}}</ref> His family were unable to settle in the West Midlands at this time, so he returned to Southampton, initially working in the community office, before becoming reserve team coach under [[Dave Jones (football manager)|Dave Jones]] in July 1997, moving up to first team coach in November 1998, a role he retained after the appointment of [[Glenn Hoddle]] as manager in January 2000.<ref name="LMA" />

When Hoddle was lured away to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in March 2001, Gray initially took over as [[caretaker manager]], before taking on the role permanently in June,<ref name="LMA" /> as Southampton moved to their new [[St Mary's Stadium]]. Early results were poor and chairman [[Rupert Lowe]] panicked about the effect on the club's investment in the new stadium and Gray was sacked after little more than three months in charge, to be replaced by [[Gordon Strachan]]. During his brief tenure as manager, he broke Southampton's transfer record, signing [[Rory Delap]] for a fee of £4 million.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Malone |first1=Emmet |title=Delap decides to accept Southampton offer |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/delap-decides-to-accept-southampton-offer-1.317308 |access-date=8 July 2023 |work=Irish Times |date=11 July 2001}}</ref>

===Coaching===
He has since coached successfully at a number of football clubs. These include [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], where he and [[John Deehan]] acted as joint caretaker managers after the departure of [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]]. Stuart Gray moved briefly to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] to assist caretaker manager, [[Kit Symons]]. He then joined [[Dave Jones (football manager)|Dave Jones]] at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the capacity of assistant manager. The two had previously worked together at Southampton. After the dismissal of Jones from Wolverhampton, Gray remained as assistant manager to [[Glenn Hoddle]], once more acting as caretaker manager after Hoddle's departure; he had served as a caretaker for a month between the departure of Jones and arrival of Hoddle.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/4009009.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wolves 0–1 Coventry | date=20 November 2004}}</ref>

===Northampton Town===
On 2 January 2007, Gray was appointed as the manager of [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] after accepting a {{frac|2|1|2}}-year contract; he replaced [[John Gorman (footballer)|John Gorman]] who had resigned on 20 December 2006.<ref name="Northampton name Gray as manager">{{cite news

Gray was sacked as Northampton Town Manager on 8 September 2009, following relegation from League 1 in the 2008–09 season and being 16th in League 2 after six games in the 2009–10 season.

===Burnley===
On 19 January 2010, Gray became the first-team coach for [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.burnley.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=185131|title=Stuart Gray Appointed First Team Coach|date=19 January 2010 |publisher=vitalfootball|access-date=25 March 2010}}</ref> On 30 December he was appointed caretaker manager following the departure of [[Brian Laws]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Gray Placed In Temporary Charge|url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~2254104,00.html|publisher=Burnley FC|access-date=30 December 2010|date=30 December 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102070400/http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~2254104,00.html|archive-date=2 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Gray left Burnley on 13 May 2011 as part of a restructuring after the club failed to achieve even a play-off place in the season just ended.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~2359186,00.html |title=Gray and Hoskin Leave In Re-Shuffle|publisher=Burnley F C official website| date=13 May 2011 | access-date=17 May 2011}}</ref> Gray became first-team coach at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] but was made redundant in April 2012 as part of cost cutting due to their financial difficulties.<ref>{{cite news|title=Coach Stuart Gray loses Portsmouth job|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17869005|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=27 April 2012}}</ref>

In December 2012, Gray was hired by his former [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] colleague, [[Dave Jones (football manager)|Dave Jones]], as a member of the coaching staff at [[Football League Championship|Championship]] club [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sheffield Wednesday: Stuart Gray experience important - Jones|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20801752|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=20 December 2012}}</ref>

Following the departure of Dave Jones from Sheffield Wednesday at the end of November 2013 Gray took over as caretaker manager with a view to taking on the managerial role permanently, and as of 8 February had led Wednesday to a run of eleven unbeaten games in all competitions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coach Stuart Gray appointed caretaker manager of Sheffield-Wednesday|date=3 December 2013 |url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/446457/Coach-Stuart-Gray-appointed-caretaker-manager-of-Sheffield-Wednesday|publisher=Daily Express|access-date=3 December 2013}}</ref>

Stuart Gray was appointed as head coach of Sheffield Wednesday following the 2–1 win over Rochdale in the FA Cup on 25 January 2014.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2014-01-25 |title=Stuart Gray: Sheffield Wednesday hire ex-Saints boss as head coach |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25899507 |access-date=2025-11-23 |work=BBC Sport |language=en-GB}}</ref>

In his one full season in charge of the club, he secured their highest finish for six years, finishing 13th in a Championship campaign that also saw Wednesday equal their clean sheet record for a season.

Following a takeover at Sheffield Wednesday by Thai businessman [[Dejphon Chansiri]], Gray was sacked in the summer of 2015<ref>{{cite web|title=Stuart Gray: Sheffield Wednesday head coach sacked|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33104297|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=4 August 2015|date=11 June 2015}}</ref> and replaced by head coach [[Carlos Carvalhal]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33126643|title=Sheffield Wednesday name Carlos Carvalhal as new head coach|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=30 June 2015|access-date=4 August 2015}}</ref>
