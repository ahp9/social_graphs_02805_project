'''Vincent Jean Mpoy Kompany''' (born 10 April 1986) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|football]] [[Manager (association football)|manager]] and former [[Association football|player]] who played as a [[centre-back]]. He is the head coach of [[Bundesliga]] club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. As a player, he is best known for his eleven seasons at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], eight of which he served as captain. Kompany also represented the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]] for fifteen years and served as [[List of Belgium national football team captains|its captain]]. He has been cited as one of the best [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] in [[Premier League]] history.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ritchie |first=Calum |date=22 June 2023 |title=The 30 greatest defenders in Premier League history have been ranked |url=https://www.givemesport.com/greatest-defenders-premier-league-history/ |access-date=8 September 2025 |website=[[GiveMeSport]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |author1=Steven Chicken |date=18 August 2024 |title=Ranked!

Kompany began his professional career at [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]]; having graduated from their [[youth system]], he was with the club for three seasons as a first-team player before moving to [[Bundesliga]] club [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg]] in 2006. In the summer of 2008, he completed a transfer to [[Premier League]] club Manchester City, where he was an integral part of the squad and regarded as one of the bargain buys of the revolutionised City era, blossoming into one of the league's best centre-backs. In the [[2011–12 Manchester City F.C. season|2011–12 season]], he was awarded the [[Captain (association football)|captaincy]] of City, leading his club to win the Premier League that season, their first league title in 44 years. Kompany was included in the [[PFA Team of the Year|Premier League Team of the Year]] in 2011, 2012, and 2014, and won the [[Premier League Player of the Season]] in 2012. Kompany won eleven more trophies at City and made 360 total appearances.<ref name="Stands alone">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/10931612/World-Cup-2014-Vincent-Kompany-stands-alone-in-a-tournament-seriously-short-on-top-class-defenders.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/10931612/World-Cup-2014-Vincent-Kompany-stands-alone-in-a-tournament-seriously-short-on-top-class-defenders.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=World Cup 2014: Vincent Kompany stands alone in a tournament seriously short on top-class defenders|work=The Telegraph|last=Hansen|first=Alan|date=27 June 2014|access-date=22 September 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Kompany earned 89 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in a 15-year international career, having made his debut in 2004 at age 17. He was part of their squad that came fourth at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008 Olympics]] and went to the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]], coming a best-ever third at the latter. He served as [[Captain (association football)|captain]] from 2010.

In 2019, when his contract expired after eleven years at City, Kompany returned to Anderlecht as [[Player-coach|player-manager]]. A year later, he announced his retirement from professional football and became the first-team manager. In 2022, he was hired by [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], winning the [[EFL Championship]] in his first season, before being [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] from the Premier League the [[2023–24 Premier League|following season]]. He was appointed by  [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in 2024 following the departure of [[Thomas Tuchel]] and won the [[2024–25 Bundesliga]] in his first season at the club.

==Club career==
===Anderlecht===
Born in [[Uccle]], Brussels, Kompany started his career at [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] at the age of 17. He made his professional debut on 30 July 2003 in a [[UEFA Champions League]] second qualifying round first leg away to [[CS Rapid București|Rapid București]], starting in a goalless draw.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lauwens |first1=Jean-François |last2=Dewez |first2=Alain |title=Bilan(9) - Les belles histoires du sport belge en 2003 Kompany, le jeune homme tranquille REPÈRES |url=https://www.lesoir.be/art/bilan-9-les-belles-histoires-du-sport-belge-en-2003-kom_t-20040105-Z0NXFP.html |access-date=13 May 2024 |work=Le Soir |date=5 January 2004 |language=French}}</ref> His first goal on 1 February 2004 came in a 3–1 win away to [[Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint-Truiden]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Anderlecht stride ahead |url=https://www.uefa.com/news-media/news/019a-0f8ede759706-04744b2f3bca-1000--anderlecht-stride-ahead/ |access-date=13 May 2024 |publisher=UEFA |date=1 February 2004}}</ref>

Kompany won several awards including the [[Belgian Golden Shoe]] and the [[Belgian Ebony Shoe]]. Although several top European sides immediately showed interest, the player and his entourage decided to first develop a few more years at Anderlecht. "Don't you worry, I will stay here," he told Berend Scholten at UEFA.com. "At the moment the zeros in my contract are not so important. If I wanted to leave, I would have been gone already."<ref>{{cite news|first=Berend|last=Scholten|title=Anderlecht hold on to Kompany|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0197-0e6a75ffc44f-5e3b081733b8-1000--anderlecht-hold-on-to-kompany/|publisher=Berend Scholten at UEFA.com|access-date=4 November 2003}}</ref> In November 2003, still under contract until 2006, he agreed to extend his deal for two more years upon his 18th birthday in April 2004.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kompany commits to Anderlecht |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/3258327.stm |access-date=13 May 2024 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 November 2003}}</ref>

In late 2003, Kompany was a target for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] manager  [[Alex Ferguson]] to cover the long-term suspension of defender [[Rio Ferdinand]]. Ferguson attended Anderlecht's trip to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in the Champions League group stage so that he could watch Kompany, but was instead impressed by Celtic midfielder [[Liam Miller]] and signed him.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kelly |first1=Ciaran |title=How Manchester United hero Liam Miller stole the spotlight from Vincent Kompany |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-utd-news-miller-kompany-14336810 |access-date=24 November 2023 |work=Manchester Evening News |date=26 February 2018}}</ref> Additionally, Kompany's mother would not let him transfer until he had finished his education.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vurley |first1=Callum |title=Vincent Kompany was wanted by Manchester United but became a Manchester City legend – now he's out to ruin title defence |url=https://talksport.com/football/1528395/man-utd-vincent-kompany-transfer-alex-ferguson-burnley-man-city/ |access-date=24 November 2023 |work=Talksport |date=10 August 2023}}</ref>

In August 2008, Kompany fell out with Hamburg over his decision to play at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|Olympic tournament]] in China. After leaving the club, he criticised chairman [[Bernd Hoffmann]] as "one of those people who know about money, but don't know anything about football". Kompany speculated that the club's lack of success in the past 20 years despite its large supporter base could not be attributed to the players alone.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ives |first1=Chris |title=Kompany hits out at Hamburg |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/4089871/kompany-hits-out-at-hamburg |access-date=29 May 2024 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=3 September 2008}}</ref>

In April 2014, Kompany opened two new sports bars in Belgium called Good Kompany, one at the Grand-Place in [[Brussels]] and the other at the Groenplaats in [[Antwerp]]. However, Kompany closed down both bars within a year of their opening. At the time of their closure, Kompany was quoted as saying: "I regret this decision. We had enough customers, turnover was good, but not enough to cover the costs. So that's where it ends. Lesson 1 in business: investments are always a risk. You win some, you lose some."<ref>{{cite news|title='Good Kompany' closes its doors in Antwerp|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/videozone_ENG/1.2248947|newspaper=Flandersnews.be |date=23 February 2015 |access-date=28 May 2015 }}</ref>
