'''Walter Ferguson Smith''' (24 February 1948&nbsp;– 26 October 2021)<ref name="The Telegraph">{{cite news |title=Walter Smith - Obituary - Football - The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2021/10/27/walter-smith-formidable-football-manager-led-scotlands-national/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2021/10/27/walter-smith-formidable-football-manager-led-scotlands-national/ |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |website=The Telegraph |date=27 October 2021 |access-date=27 October 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref> was a Scottish [[association football|football]] player, [[manager (association football)|manager]] and director, primarily associated with his two spells as manager of Glasgow club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].

A [[Defender (association football)|defender]], Smith's playing career consisted of two spells with [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], split by a short time at [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]]. A pelvic injury caused his retirement from playing and Smith moved into coaching at Dundee United, working for manager [[Jim McLean]]. Smith also took charge of the [[Scotland national under-19 football team|Scotland under-18]] and [[Scotland national under-21 football team|under-21]] teams, and assisted [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] manager [[Alex Ferguson]] at the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico, after it had been announced that he would be moving to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] as assistant to [[Graeme Souness]].

Smith became the manager of Rangers in 1991, succeeding Souness. He won thirteen major trophies in seven years, including seven league titles in succession. After leaving Rangers at the end of the 1997–98 season, he was appointed manager of English [[Premier League]] club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. He was in charge at [[Goodison Park]] for four seasons before he was sacked in 2002.

After a brief stint as assistant manager to Alex Ferguson at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], Smith was appointed Scotland manager in December 2004. He presided over a revival in their fortunes, taking the national team seventy places up the [[FIFA World Rankings]]. After a [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying]], he resigned as Scotland manager in January 2007 to return to Rangers. He won eight trophies during his second spell as Rangers manager and guided the team to the [[2008 UEFA Cup final]], before retiring from management in 2011. Smith is the second-most-successful manager in the history of Rangers, behind [[Bill Struth]].

==Early life==
Smith was born in [[Lanark]], but grew up in the [[Carmyle]] district in the East End of [[Glasgow]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgowhistory.co.uk/Books/Carmyle%20Recollections/Chapters/Leisure.htm|title=Carmyle recollections – Leisure activities|publisher=East End Glasgow History|date=1 March 2010|access-date=9 October 2017|archive-date=3 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190521/http://www.glasgowhistory.co.uk/Books/Carmyle%20Recollections/Chapters/Leisure.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> and was a boyhood fan of Rangers.<ref name=gersboss>{{cite web |url=https://rangers.co.uk/club/history/former-managers/walter-smith/|title=Manager profile: Walter Smith|work=Official website|publisher=Rangers F.C.|access-date=9 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=blueblood>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2305859/King-Walters-blue-blood-set-to-decide-his-destiny.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2305859/King-Walters-blue-blood-set-to-decide-his-destiny.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title='King Walter's' blue blood set to decide his destiny|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=10 January 2007|access-date=27 August 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref> He was employed by the [[South of Scotland Electricity Board]], and played youth football for [[Drumchapel Amateur F.C.|Drumchapel Amateurs]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Sir Alex Ferguson unveils portrait of Drumchapel Amateurs founder Douglas Smith in the Scottish Football Museum|url=https://www.scottishfootballmuseum.org.uk/sir-alex-ferguson-unveils-portrait-of-drumchapel-amateurs-founder-douglas-smith-in-the-scottish-football-museum/|publisher=Scottish Football Museum|date=20 February 2014|access-date=18 January 2018|archive-date=18 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418163815/https://scottishfootballmuseum.org.uk/sir-alex-ferguson-unveils-portrait-of-drumchapel-amateurs-founder-douglas-smith-in-the-scottish-football-museum/|url-status=dead}}</ref> before launching his football career in the 1960s with [[Scottish Junior Football Association|Junior League]] team [[Ashfield F.C.|Ashfield]].<ref name="HerScot">{{cite web |title=Walter Smith, managerial legend who steered Rangers to 21 trophies |date=26 October 2021 |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/19674424.obituary-walter-smith-managerial-legend-steered-rangers-21-trophies/ |publisher=Herald Scotland |access-date=27 October 2021}}</ref>

==Playing career==

===Dundee United===
Smith was one of three Ashfield players signed by [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] manager [[Jerry Kerr]] in 1966, joining the club in November shortly after teammates [[Jim Cameron (Scottish footballer)|Jim Cameron]] and [[Gerry Hernon]]. A versatile player, Smith appeared for the reserve team in a number of positions, initially as a [[right-half]]. He made his first team debut in a [[Scottish Football League]] match against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] on 20 March 1967. He continued to play regularly for the reserves, but made only a handful of first-team appearances for Dundee United over the next four years until establishing himself in the latter part of the [[1970–71 in Scottish football|1970–71 season]].<ref name="Gracie">{{cite book|last1=Gracie|first1=Steve|title=The Rise of the Terrors: Dundee United FC, a Comprehensive History 1945–1979|date=2009|publisher=Arabest Publishing|location=Dundee|isbn=9780955834110|pages=307–308}}</ref> He also played for the [[Dallas Tornado]] in the [[United Soccer Association]] in 1967, when their roster was supplemented with Dundee United players.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasljerseys.com/Players/S/Smith.Walter.htm|title=NASL-Walter Smith|website=nasljerseys.com}}</ref>

Smith remained a regular first-team player for United until 1974, often in [[Centre back|central defence]]. His future coaching mentor [[Jim McLean]] became manager in December 1971, and the following month his future managerial assistant [[Archie Knox]] became a teammate. In September 1973, Smith scored the only goal of the game as United defeated [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] in the [[Dundee derby]]; he celebrated by kissing his boot, a gesture which he was later embarrassed by. He played in the [[1974 Scottish Cup Final]] against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], Dundee United's first appearance in a major final, but finished with a runners-up medal following a 3–0 defeat.<ref name="Gracie" />

Smith played less regularly the following season, and in September 1975 was sold to [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]]. He had played in 108 league games, scoring two goals, between 1966 and 1975.<ref name="DUFC">{{cite news|title=Walter Smith – Player Statistics|url=http://www.dufcarchive.co.uk/player.php?id=209|access-date=9 October 2017|work=DUFC Archive|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822033707/http://www.dufcarchive.co.uk/player.php?id=209|archive-date=22 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Dumbarton and return to Dundee United===
Smith was brought to Dumbarton for a fee of £8,000 by the management team of [[Alex Wright (footballer, born 1930)|Alex Wright]] and former Rangers player [[Davie Wilson]], who was one of Smith's heroes as a teenage supporter. Wilson worked alongside Smith's father at a local [[steelworks]] in the village of [[Westburn, South Lanarkshire|Westburn]], [[Cambuslang]], and was a senior teammate at Dundee United.<ref name=golden>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/competitions/scottish-cup/interview-davie-wilson-on-golden-era-at-ibrox-and-hampden-1-4101820|title=Interview: Davie Wilson on golden era at Ibrox and Hampden|date=16 April 2016|access-date=11 October 2017|work=[[The Scotsman]]}}</ref><ref name=warfare>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/rangers/11190909/Walter-Smith-reveals-how-long-running-internal-warfare-at-Rangers-has-kept-him-away-from-Ibrox.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/rangers/11190909/Walter-Smith-reveals-how-long-running-internal-warfare-at-Rangers-has-kept-him-away-from-Ibrox.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Walter Smith reveals how long-running internal warfare at Rangers has kept him away from Ibrox|date=27 October 2014|access-date=11 October 2017|work=The Daily Telegraph }}{{cbignore}}</ref> During his spell with Dumbarton, the club made a rare appearance at the semi-final stage of the [[1975–76 Scottish Cup#Semi-final|Scottish Cup in 1976]], losing to [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] after a replay, with Smith scoring an early [[own goal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/dumbarton-supermo-gilbert-lawrie-yearns-3208508|title=Dumbarton supermo Gilbert Lawrie yearns after another cup semi-final despite memory of Walter Smith's own-goal clanger|work=Daily Record|date=5 March 2014 |access-date=11 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/games/197604141.html|title=Hearts 3 Dumbarton 0, 14 April 1976|publisher=London Hearts Supporters Club|access-date=11 October 2017}}</ref>

He played in 44 league games for Dumbarton<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sonsarchive.com/player.php?id=542|title=Dumbarton player Walter Smith profile|publisher=Dumbarton Football Club Historical Archive|access-date=11 October 2017}}</ref> before McLean paid a fee of £4,000 to bring him back to Dundee United in February 1977. Shortly afterwards, however, a serious pelvic injury effectively curtailed Smith's playing career at the age of 29.<ref name=gersboss/>

Thereafter, he played mainly in the reserve team, helping to develop younger players. His final first-team appearance was in September 1980, by which time he was embarking on a coaching career. He appeared in 26 league matches during his second spell and, in total, made 183 senior appearances for Dundee United, scoring three goals. Additionally, he set a club record by making approximately 360 reserve-team appearances.<ref name="Gracie" /><ref name="DUFC" />

==Managerial career==

===Coaching Dundee United and Scotland===
He developed his coaching skills as assistant manager to Jim McLean, at a time when Dundee United were [[1982–83 Scottish Premier Division|Scottish champions]] and [[1983–84 European Cup|European Cup semi-finalists]].<ref name=gersboss/> While working with McLean, a notoriously hard-bitten manager, Smith developed a reputation for being a strict disciplinarian. According to [[Kevin Gallacher]], who was an apprentice of the club at the time in the early 1980s, Smith could become ferociously angry and was known to deal out punches to enforce discipline.<ref name=thug>{{cite news|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/comment/Profile-Walter-Smith.4049165.jp|title=Profile: Walter Smith|work=Scotland on Sunday|date=8 May 2008|access-date=28 June 2010|archive-date=2 February 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130202001243/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/comment/Profile-Walter-Smith.4049165.jp|url-status=dead}}</ref> He joined Dundee United's board of directors in 1986.<ref name="contract" />

In 1978, he was appointed coach of the [[Scotland national under-18 football team|Scotland Under-18 team]], and helped them to win the [[1982 UEFA European Under-18 Championship|European Youth Championship in 1982]].<ref name=gersboss/> He became coach of the [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Under 21 team]], and was [[Alex Ferguson]]'s assistant manager during the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 Mexico World Cup]].<ref name=gersboss/> Ferguson commented on Smith by saying: "There are few people in the game with his experience, knowledge and technical ability."<ref name=thug/>

===Rangers===
In late February 1986, Smith attended a meeting the [[Gleneagles Hotel]] at which he was informed that [[Graeme Souness]] was to be appointed player-manager of Rangers, and the latter wanted Smith as his assistant.<ref name="Smith 1994 book">{{cite book |first1=Walter |last1=Smith |first2=Ken |last2=Gallacher |title=Mr Smith: The Fan Who Joined the Ibrox Legends |publisher=Mainstream Publishing Company |year=1994 |isbn=9-781-851586-684 }}</ref> Smith accepted the offer and within a few weeks Rangers made an official approach to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], who demanded £50,000 in compensation. The then Rangers chief executive [[David Holmes (businessman)|David Holmes]] duly paid that amount, and Smith was allowed to join Rangers on 16 April.<ref name="Smithin">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19860416&printsec=frontpage&hl=en Smith was appointed assistant manager on 16 April and took on coaching responsibilities until Souness arrived on 1 May]</ref> Smith was initially placed in temporary charge of the first team whilst Souness negotiated his own release from his playing contact with Italian side [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]].<ref name="Smith 1994 book"/><ref name="gersboss" /> He took sole charge of two [[Scottish Premier Division]] matches, on 19 and 26 April, both away, to [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] respectively.<ref name="Smith 1994 book"/>

Smith helped Souness guide Rangers to Premier Division and League Cup glory in [[1986–87 in Scottish football|1986–87]], another League Cup in [[1987–88 in Scottish football|1987–88]], the Premier Division and League Cup again in [[1988–89 in Scottish football|1988–89]], a second successive league title in [[1989–90 in Scottish football|1989–90]] and another League Cup in [[1990–91 Scottish League Cup|1990–91]].<ref>[http://www.rangers.co.uk/clubHistory/article/2566824]{{Dead link|date=February 2019|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

With Souness continuing to play regularly until 1988, Smith was the principal figure in the dugout for many matches. In addition, Smith took sole charge of the team in the [[1987 Scottish League Cup Final]] as Souness was suspended.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19871026&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald |date=26 October 1987 |page=9 |title=Spot-on Rangers earn the cheers |first=Jim |last=Reynolds |access-date=21 October 2017}}</ref> Souness was subject to an extensive touchline ban from February 1989, although he frequently circumvented this by naming himself as a [[substitute (association football)|substitute]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/stephen-halliday-six-game-ban-unfair-try-a-two-year-stint-for-size-1-1497967 |title=Stephen Halliday: Six-game ban unfair?

When Souness left for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in April 1991, Smith was appointed interim manager.<ref name=blueblood/> This was made permanent in May 1991, after the club clinched its [[1990–91 Scottish Premier Division|fourth title]] in five seasons.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/13030001.FLASHBACK__1991_______Mark_Walters_and_Scott_Booth_recall_their_part_in_Smith___s_maiden_final_day_triumph_walters_BOOTH/|title=Flashback: 1991, Mark Walters and Scott Booth recall their part in Smith's maiden final-day triumph|date=14 May 2011|access-date=21 October 2017|work=[[The Herald (Scotland)|The Herald]]}}</ref> Six more league titles in succession followed under Smith's tenure, including a [[Treble (association football)|domestic treble]] in [[1992–93 in Scottish football|1992–93]].<ref name=gersboss/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-hateley-cleans-up-for-rangers-2316334.html |title=Football: Hateley cleans up for Rangers|date=29 May 1993|access-date=21 October 2017|work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref><ref name=blueblood/> He also won the [[Scottish Cup]] and the [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] three times each. Smith took Rangers to the brink of the final of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] in [[1992–93 UEFA Champions League|season 1992–93]], going ten games without defeat in that campaign<ref>[https://www.rsssf.org/ec/ec199293.html "European Competitions 1992–93"] Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation.</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=It's Rangers for me? |last=Magee |first=Jonathan |year=2007 |publisher=Fort Publishing |location=Glasgow |isbn=978-1-905769-10-0 |page=207 |quote=At this time David Murray was reaching a decade in charge and in this period Rangers had spent £90&nbsp;million on players and £52&nbsp;million on stadium development. |chapter='Old' and 'New' at Rangers Football Club }}</ref> and 44 matches unbeaten in all competitions.<ref name=gersboss/>

Rangers equalled Celtic's record of [[Nine in a row|nine successive championships]] in 1996–97. In an effort to secure a record-breaking tenth success in 1997–98, Rangers spent £13m on eight new players.<ref name=Indy/> In European competition, Rangers were beaten 4–1 by [[IFK Gothenburg]] in the [[1997–98 UEFA Champions League]] preliminary round and 4–2 by [[R.C. Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] in the first round of the [[1997–98 UEFA Cup]]. There was growing pressure on Smith because of poor European results, and it was announced in October 1997 that he would leave Rangers at the end of the season. Rangers lost the league title to Celtic on the final day<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/90174.stm |title=Celtic get by with a little help from their Scandinavians |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 May 1998 |access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref> and then lost the [[1998 Scottish Cup final]] to [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]].<ref name="98final">{{Cite news |first=Calum |last=Philip |title=Scottish Cup Final: Stage of dramatic Hearts |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-scottish-cup-final-stage-of-dramatic-hearts-1158932.html |work=The Independent |location=London |date=17 May 1998 |access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref>

===Everton===
After success in his native Scotland, Smith's retirement lasted a month as he took the manager's job at [[Premier League]] club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in June 1998.<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/everton/1865462.stm Everton move for Moyes], BBC Sport, 13 March 2002</ref> Initially Smith had been linked with the manager's job at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]],<ref name=years>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/e/everton/1870232.stm Smith's Everton years], BBC Sport, 13 March 2002</ref> but false promises made to him by the Everton chairman of massive transfer funds and unlimited ambition lured Smith to Goodison Park.<ref name=years /> Smith spent money on players only to discover that it was money the club did not have.<ref name=years /> When [[Duncan Ferguson]] was sold behind Smith's back, he was tempted to quit.<ref name=years /> The remainder of his time at Everton revolved around selling the club's better players such as [[John Collins (footballer, born 1968)|John Collins]], [[Olivier Dacourt]], [[Don Hutchison]], [[Marco Materazzi]], [[Nick Barmby]], [[Francis Jeffers]] and [[Michael Ball (footballer)|Michael Ball]]  to balance the books.<ref name=years />

Under Smith, Everton finished in the bottom half of the table for three consecutive seasons. The Everton board finally ran out of patience with Smith and he was sacked in March 2002 after an "abject"<ref name=years/> 3–0 FA Cup sixth-round defeat to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], with Everton in some danger of relegation from the Premier League.<ref name="Sacked">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/e/everton/1869018.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |title=Smith succumbs to pressure |date=13 March 2002 }}</ref> He was replaced by [[David Moyes]], who managed Everton to a safe finish in fifteenth place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/everton/2001-2002/table|title=Everton League Table 2001-2002 - Statto.com|date=22 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322080744/http://www.statto.com/football/teams/everton/2001-2002/table|archive-date=22 March 2016}}</ref>

===Manchester United===
In March 2004, Smith returned to football when he had a short spell as assistant manager to [[Alex Ferguson]] at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at the end of the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04 season]].<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/3530463.stm "Walter Smith joins Man Utd"] BBC Sport. 3 March 2004.</ref> During this time [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] won the [[2004 FA Cup Final]], beating [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in Cardiff.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/15580178 |title=Walter Smith on Sir Alex Ferguson's 25 years at Man Utd |website=BBC Sport |date=4 November 2011 |access-date=24 March 2019 }}</ref>

===Return to Rangers===
On 5 January 2007, press outlets reported that [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] had spoken to Smith with a view to hiring him to manage Rangers again, with [[Ally McCoist]] as assistant manager.<ref name="Rangers Return">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2305597/Rangers-opt-for-McCoist-and-Smith.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2305597/Rangers-opt-for-McCoist-and-Smith.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |publisher=The Telegraph Sport|title=Rangers opt for McCoist and Smith |date=4 January 2007 |location=London |first=Roddy |last=Forsyth }}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name=blueblood/> The Scottish FA initially rebuffed Rangers' approach for Smith, but his return as Rangers manager was announced on 10 January 2007.<ref name="rangers-job-2007">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6233237.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Smith appointed boss of Rangers |date=10 January 2007}}</ref> He succeeded [[Paul Le Guen]], who had left the club by mutual consent after Rangers had been knocked out of the [[2006–07 Scottish League Cup]] by [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] and fallen 17 points behind [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in the [[2006–07 Scottish Premier League]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6231965.stm|title=Rangers reel as Le Guen departs|date=4 January 2007|work=BBC Sport|access-date=26 October 2021}}</ref> caretaker manager [[Ian Durrant]] (who had previously played under him) was retained on the coaching staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/30585753|title=Rangers: Gordon Durie to replace Ian Durrant in backroom team|date=23 December 2014|work=BBC Sport|access-date=26 October 2021}}</ref>

Smith's first match in his second spell at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] was a 5–0 win against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] on 13 January, with two goals from [[Kris Boyd]] and one each from [[Barry Ferguson]], [[Chris Burke (footballer)|Chris Burke]] and [[Charlie Adam]]. Smith's first final since his return was secured with a 2–0 win over [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] in the [[2007–08 Scottish League Cup]]. Rangers played [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] in the [[2008 Scottish League Cup Final]]; the game was drawn 1–1 after normal time, and 2–2 after extra time. The winners were decided by penalty kicks. Rangers won 3–2, with [[Kris Boyd]] scoring the winning penalty (as well as the goals for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in normal time and extra time).<ref name=gersboss/>

In the [[2007–08 UEFA Cup]], Smith booked Rangers' first European final for 36 years, after an exit in the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage on the final day after good results against [[VFB Stuttgart]], [[Olympique Lyonnais]] and [[FC Barcelona]]. In the quarter-final, after a 0–0 home draw with [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting]], Rangers went on to win the away leg 2–0. In the semi-final they drew 0–0 in both legs against [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] and after extra time, they won 4–2 on penalties, taking Rangers to the [[2008 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final]] in Manchester, which they lost 0–2 to [[Zenit St. Petersburg]].<ref name=zenit>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7393752.stm|title=Zenit St Petersburg 2–0 Rangers |date=14 May 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref> Rangers also narrowly missed out on the league title, partly attributable to an end-of-season fixture backlog due to their cup runs.

In the [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League]] second qualifying round, Rangers drew 0–0 with Lithuanian side [[FBK Kaunas]] at Ibrox on 30 July 2008 and lost the return leg 2–1. The loss against Kaunas meant Rangers made an early exit from European competition. Rangers went on to claim the [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]] title – the club's 52nd championship – on 24 May 2009. Smith followed this up with the [[Scottish Cup]] a week later to end the season with a League and Cup double.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_cups/8072822.stm|title=Rangers 1–0 Falkirk|date=30 May 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref>
