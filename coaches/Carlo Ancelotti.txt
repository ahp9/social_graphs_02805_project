As a player, Ancelotti won two European Cups with [[AC Milan]] in 1989 and 1990, making him one of seven people to have won the European Cup/Champions League as both a player and a manager. He played as a [[midfielder]] and began his career with Italian club [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]], helping the club get promoted to [[Serie B]] in the 1978–79 season. He moved to [[AS Roma|Roma]] the following season, where he won a [[Serie A]] title and four [[Coppa Italia]] titles. He then played for the late 1980s Milan team and won many titles, including two ''Scudetti'' and two European Cups. At international level, he had 26 appearances and one goal for the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]]. He represented Italy at two [[FIFA World Cup]]s and at the [[UEFA Euro 1988]], finishing in third place at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] and being a semi-finalist at the Euro tournament.

As a manager, Ancelotti worked for [[AC Reggiana 1919|Reggiana]], Parma, and [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] between 1995 and 2001. He then joined Milan in 2001 and went on to win both the [[2002–03 UEFA Champions League|2002–03 Champions League]] and [[2002–03 Coppa Italia]]. The following season, he won the [[2003–04 Serie A|''Scudetto'']] with an Italian record of 82 points. In 2007, he won his second [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] with Milan. Ancelotti was awarded the [[Serie A Coach of the Year]] twice. He resigned from Milan after the [[2008–09 AC Milan season|2008–09]] season and was the club's longest-serving manager.<ref>{{cite web |title=Carlo Ancelotti |url=http://www.magliarossonera.it/protagonisti/All-Ancelotti.html |website=Maglia Rossonera |language=it |access-date=19 June 2010}}</ref>

In 2009, Ancelotti became the manager of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and won the [[Double (association football)|domestic double]] of the [[2009–10 Premier League|Premier League]] and the [[2009–10 FA Cup|FA Cup]] in his first season. In 2011, he became the manager of  [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]; the [[2012–13 Ligue 1|following season]], he won their first [[Ligue 1]] title in 19 years and was awarded joint [[Trophées UNFP du football|Ligue 1 Manager of the Year]]. Following his success in France, Ancelotti became the manager of Real Madrid. In his first season, he led Real Madrid to their [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|tenth Champions League]] title and a [[2013–14 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]] title. Despite winning more trophies with the club and being awarded the [[Miguel Muñoz Trophy]] in [[2014–15 La Liga|2014–15]] for the best manager in La Liga, Ancelotti was dismissed from Real Madrid in May 2015. He became the manager of [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in 2016 and won the [[2016–17 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] title in his first season. Following stints at [[SSC Napoli|Napoli]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] between 2018 and 2021, he returned to Real Madrid in the summer of 2021, where he won two La Liga–Champions League doubles in 2022 and 2024. In 2025, he was appointed as coach of a national team for the first time when he took on the position with Brazil.

== Club career ==
=== Parma ===
Ancelotti began his career in 1974 with [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]]. He made his professional debut in [[Serie C]] during the 1976–77 season, at the age of 18. Under manager [[Cesare Maldini]], he was often deployed as an [[attacking midfielder]] or as a [[second striker]], due to his eye for goal. Ancelotti excelled in these roles and helped Parma to a second place in the Serie C1 girone A during the 1978–79 season, which qualified the team for the Serie B play-offs. In the decisive match in Vicenza, against [[U.S. Triestina Calcio 1918|Triestina]], with the score tied at 1–1, he scored two goals, which gave Parma a 3–1 victory and sealed their place in [[Serie B]] the following season.<ref name="AC Milan Hall of Fame">{{cite web |url=https://www.acmilan.com/en/carlo-ancelotti |title=AC Milan Hall of Fame: Carlo Ancelotti |website=acmilan.com |publisher=AC Milan|access-date=21 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=storiedicalcio>{{cite web |url=http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/ancelotti.html |title=Carlo Ancelotti |website=Storie di Calcio |date=13 November 2015 |language=it| access-date = 20 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=treccani1>{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-ancelotti/ |title=Ancelotti, Carlo |website=treccani.it |language=it| access-date = 9 June 2016}}</ref><ref name="magliarossonera" />

=== Roma ===
[[File:Carlo Ancelotti - AS Roma 1983-84.jpg|thumb|upright|Ancelotti playing for [[AS Roma|Roma]] during the [[1983–84 AS Roma season|1983–84 season]]]]

After attracting strong interest from [[Inter Milan]], in mid-1979 Ancelotti transferred to [[AS Roma|Roma]], and made his Serie A debut in a 0–0 draw against [[AC Milan]] on 16 September.<ref name="AC Milan Hall of Fame" /><ref name=storiedicalcio /><ref name=treccani2>{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-ancelotti_(Enciclopedia-dello-Sport)/ |title=Ancelotti, Carlo |website=treccani.it |language=it |first=Alberto |last=Costa| access-date = 9 June 2016}}</ref> Under manager [[Nils Liedholm]], he was deployed as a winger or central midfielder and became one of the club's most important players, in a team which featured Brazilian midfielders [[Paulo Roberto Falcão|Falcão]] and [[Toninho Cerezo]], as well as Italian footballers [[Roberto Pruzzo]], [[Bruno Conti]], [[Agostino Di Bartolomei]] and [[Pietro Vierchowod]], winning consecutive [[Coppa Italia]] titles in his first two seasons with the club. During his eight seasons in Rome, he won the Coppa Italia a total of four times (1980, 1981, 1984 and 1986). After struggling with knee injuries, and managing second and third-place league finishes in [[1980–81 Serie A|1981]] and [[1981–82 Serie A|1982]], Ancelotti helped lead the team to win the [[List of Italian football champions|Italian championship]] in [[1982–83 Serie A|1983]], the club's second league title in their history.<ref name=storiedicalcio />

In the [[1983–84 Serie A|following season]], Ancelotti helped Roma to win another Coppa Italia title and reach the [[European Cup]] final in 1984, although he missed the final through injury, as Roma were defeated by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on penalties at the [[Stadio Olimpico]] in Rome.<ref name="AC Milan Hall of Fame" /><ref name=storiedicalcio /><ref name=treccani2 /> He was named the team's [[Captain (association football)|captain]] in 1985 under new club manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]], and served as a mentor to the young midfielder [[Giuseppe Giannini]], as Roma won the [[1985–86 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], but once again narrowly missed out on the league title during the [[1985–86 Serie A]] season, finishing in second place behind Juventus.<ref name="AC Milan Hall of Fame" /><ref name=storiedicalcio /><ref name="magliarossonera" />

=== AC Milan ===
From 1987 until 1992, Ancelotti played for Milan, and was a key part of the squad that won the [[1987–88 Serie A|Serie A title in 1988]], consecutive European Cups in [[1988–89 European Cup|1989]] and [[1989–90 European Cup|1990]], two [[European Super Cup]]s, two [[Intercontinental Cup (1960–2004)|Intercontinental Cups]] and a [[Supercoppa Italiana]] under manager [[Arrigo Sacchi]].<ref name="AC Milan Hall of Fame" /> During this time, Milan, under the financial backing of club president [[Silvio Berlusconi]], featured players such as [[Paolo Maldini]], [[Franco Baresi]], [[Mauro Tassotti]] and [[Alessandro Costacurta]] as defenders; [[Frank Rijkaard]], [[Ruud Gullit]] and [[Roberto Donadoni]] as midfielders; and [[Marco van Basten]] upfront.<ref name=storiedicalcio /> One of Ancelotti's most memorable moments with Milan was when he received a pass from Ruud Gullit, dribbled around two [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] players and netted a powerful long-range shot during the ''Rossoneri's'' 5–0 thrashing of Real Madrid in the [[1988–89 European Cup#Semi-finals|1989 European Cup semi-finals]].<ref name="The greatest teams of all time: AC Milan 1988-90">{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0253-0d7ff547ca01-af062fb1225f-1000--the-greatest-teams-of-all-time-ac-milan-1988-90/ |title=The greatest teams of all time: AC Milan 1988–90 |publisher=UEFA |first=Paolo |last=Menicucci |date=4 July 2015|access-date=9 March 2016}}</ref> He went on to play all 90 minutes in Milan's 4–0 win over [[FC Steaua București|Steaua București]] in the [[1989 European Cup Final|final]].<ref name=factfile>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jun/01/carlo-ancelotti-factfile-chelsea-milan |title=Carlo Ancelotti factfile: the road to Chelsea |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 June 2009|access-date=10 June 2016}}</ref>

The following season, Ancelotti suffered an injury to his left knee in the quarter-finals of the European Cup against [[KV Mechelen]], which forced him to miss the semi-finals, although he was able to return in time to help Milan defend their title against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[1990 European Cup Final|final]], held in [[Vienna]].<ref name=storiedicalcio /> Following Sacchi's departure, he won a second Serie A title under his replacement [[Fabio Capello]] during the [[1991–92 Serie A]] season, as Milan won the title undefeated, but persistent knee injuries and competition from youngster [[Demetrio Albertini]] limited his playing time, and eventually forced him into premature retirement at the end of the season, at the age of 33. He played the final match of his career with the club in a 4–0 home win over [[Hellas Verona FC|Hellas Verona]] on 17 May 1992, in which he came off the bench in the final 20 minutes of the game and scored two goals, and was given an ovation by the fans.<ref name="AC Milan Hall of Fame" /><ref name=storiedicalcio /><ref name="magliarossonera" />

== International career ==
Under manager [[Enzo Bearzot]], Ancelotti made his [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] debut and scored his first and only goal on 6 January 1981 in the [[1980 World Champions' Gold Cup]] against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], which ended in a 1–1 draw.<ref name=storiedicalcio /><ref name=treccani2 /> He was very likely to be capped for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup campaign]], but a dramatic knee injury forced him away for several months, as Italy went on to win the tournament without him.<ref name=storiedicalcio /><ref name=treccani2 /> He was a part of Italy's squad in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]], but did not make a single appearance, as both he and [[Paolo Rossi]] struggled during the team's fitness tests, due to the altitude of the region, and were replaced in the starting line-up by [[Fernando De Napoli]] and [[Giuseppe Galderisi]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/mondiali-1986-argentina.html/3 |title=Mondiali 1986: ARGENTINA, Capitolo III – Si ricomincia con la Bulgaria |website=Storie di Calcio |date=25 July 2016 |language=it|access-date=28 September 2017}}</ref>

Under new Italy manager [[Azeglio Vicini]], he was a key member of the Italy squad that reached the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1988]], and was also set to represent his nation at the [[Football at the 1988 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics in Seoul]] that summer. An injury to the meniscus of his right knee, however, prevented him from taking part in the tournament, where Italy ultimately managed a fourth-place finish.<ref name="storiedicalcio" /> Ancelotti later went on to play in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] on home soil under Vicini at the age of 31, although another injury in the first group match against [[Austria national football team|Austria]] once again limited his appearances in the competition to just three, and kept him on the sidelines until the third-place final against [[England national football team|England]], in which he returned to help Italy to a 2–1 win.<ref name="storiedicalcio" /> Ancelotti made a total of 26 performances for the Italy national side, and announced his retirement from international football in 1991, making his final Italy appearance under Arrigo Sacchi.<ref name="storiedicalcio" /><ref name="treccani2" /><ref name="magliarossonera" />

== Style of play ==
Ancelotti was a [[midfielder]] known for his leadership and creativity; he was regarded as one of the best Italian midfielders of his generation.<ref name="AC Milan Hall of Fame" /><ref name=storiedicalcio /><ref name=treccani1 /> Although he lacked pace and physicality, he was a talented, hardworking, and tenacious player who had excellent technical ability, tactical intelligence, vision, and passing range; his most notable skill being his powerful and accurate shooting from outside the box. A versatile midfielder, he was capable playing several midfield positions.<ref name="storiedicalcio" /><ref name="treccani2" /><ref name="is the box-to-box midfielder dead?">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/apr/22/where-have-box-to-box-midfielders-gone |title=The Question: is the box-to-box midfielder dead? |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Jonathan |last=Wilson |date=22 April 2009|access-date=15 January 2018}}</ref> He often played as a [[deep-lying playmaker]], as a [[central midfielder]], or as a [[defensive midfielder]], which allowed him to set the tempo of play after winning back the ball; he was also the mentor and predecessor of [[Demetrio Albertini]] and [[Andrea Pirlo]] when he was a playmaker at Milan. Despite his abilities, his playing time was cut short by several injuries, which forced him into retirement in 1992 at the age of 33.<ref name="storiedicalcio" /><ref name="is the box-to-box midfielder dead?" /><ref name="magliarossonera">{{cite web |url=http://www.magliarossonera.it/protagonisti/Gioc-Ancelotti.html |title=Carlo Ancelotti |website=Maglia Rossonera |language=it |access-date=11 May 2017 |archive-date=12 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912150432/http://www.magliarossonera.it/protagonisti/Gioc-Ancelotti.html |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="treccani3">{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/demetrio-albertini_%28Enciclopedia_dello_Sport%29/ |title=ALBERTINI, Demetrio |website=treccani.it |language=it| access-date = 20 December 2015}}</ref><ref name="PAURA ANCELOTTI">{{cite news |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1996/12/22/paura-ancelotti-davanti-al-maestro.html |title=Paura Ancelotti Davanti Al Maestro |newspaper=La Repubblica |location=Rome |language=it |first=Emilio |last=Marrese |date=22 December 1996|access-date=11 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1991/06/18/lentini-ultimo-acquisto.html |title=Lentini L'Ultimo Acquisto |newspaper=La Repubblica |location=Rome |language=it |first=Licia |last=Granello |date=18 June 1991|access-date=9 December 2017}}</ref>

Toward the beginning of his coaching career, and during his time with [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]], Ancelotti preferred to use a rigorous 4–4–2 formation, which made use of heavy pressing, and drew influence from that of his [[AC Milan]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] coach [[Arrigo Sacchi]], and which he believed to be the most successful system for his team; however, this system did not allow for more creative forwards, such as [[Gianfranco Zola]], [[Hristo Stoichkov]] and [[Roberto Baggio]], to play in their preferred positions, and ultimately led to Zola and Stoichkov's departure from the club, while Baggio's transfer to Parma in 1997 was impeded by Ancelotti.

Despite Ancelotti's initial reputation as a tactically inflexible coach, with Milan, he later drew praise for his ability to find systems which would best suit his players, and which allowed several talented and creative players to co-exist; under Ancelotti's management, the club enjoyed one of the most fruitful spells in its history. Ancelotti's Milan sides almost always used a strong four-man back-line, a main striker and an attacking midfielder. In his first seasons with the club, although he was initially criticised by the club's president [[Silvio Berlusconi]], due to his supposedly defensive tactics, Ancelotti was able to implement a more creative playing style based on possession when he notably adopted a 4–3–1–2, 4–1–2–1–2 or 4–4–2 diamond formation. While still preserving the team's strong defensive line, he converted attacking midfielder [[Andrea Pirlo]] to a deep-lying playmaker, which saw him play in a seemingly defensive midfield role in front of the back-line, and behind the team's advanced playmaker, either [[Rui Costa]] or [[Rivaldo]], giving the Italian more time on the ball to orchestrate the team's attacking moves from deeper areas, or to create goalscoring opportunities for the team's prolific strikers with his accurate long passing ability; the team's two playmakers were supported defensively by box-to-box midfielders on either side of them in the midfield diamond. Due to competition from [[Alessandro Nesta]], [[Paolo Maldini]], [[Roque Júnior]], [[Dario Šimić]], and later [[Jaap Stam]] in defence, he also converted former centre-back [[Alessandro Costacurta]] to a defensive left-back, alternating him with [[Kakha Kaladze]] or [[Giuseppe Pancaro]], while, due to the club's narrow midfield, the club's attacking right-back, [[Cafu]], was given licence to attack and provide width to the team; due to Cafu's offensive capabilities, Ancelotti occasionally fielded a [[Formation (association football)#4–4–1–1|4–4–1–1]] or [[Formation (association football)#3–4–1–2|3–4–1–2 formation]], which saw Cafu used as an outright winger, along with [[Serginho (footballer, born 1971)|Serginho]] or [[Marek Jankulovski]] on the left.<ref name="magliarossonera" /><ref name="Pirlo: Ancelotti changed my career" /><ref name="Andrea Pirlo v Carlo Ancelotti" /><ref name="Milan harder than Madrid" /><ref name="Shevchenko, Inzaghi bury the hatchet?" /><ref name="Carlo Ancelotti talks Bayern" /><ref name="E non dite che sono buono">{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2008/12/sport/calcio/serie-a/milan/parla-ancelotti/parla-ancelotti.html |title=Ancelotti a cuore aperto 'E non-dite che sono buono' |newspaper=La Repubblica |location=Rome |first=Gianni |last=Mura |language=it |date=19 March 2009|access-date=12 May 2017}}</ref><ref name="La Repubblica1">{{cite news |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2008/08/13/da-tardelli-desailly-cambiare-serve.html |title=Da Tardelli a Desailly, cambiare serve |newspaper=La Repubblica |location=Rome |language=it |first=Christian |last=Giordano |date=13 August 2008|access-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2005/02/07/shevchenko-crespo-san-siro-tra-brividi-gioia.html |title=Shevchenko e Crespo San Siro tra brividi e gioia |newspaper=La Repubblica |location=Rome |language=it |first=Enrico |last=Currò |date=7 February 2005|access-date=12 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2004/03/01/cafu-attaccante-aggiunto-rui-costa-tomasson.111cafu.html?ref=search |title=Cafu è l' attaccante aggiunto Rui Costa e Tomasson in ombra |newspaper=La Repubblica |location=Rome |language=it |date=1 March 2004|access-date=12 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/calcio2002_serie_a/milanchievocoppa/milanchievocoppa/milanchievocoppa.html |title=Coppa Italia, Milan-Chievo pareggio a reti inviolate |newspaper=La Repubblica |location=Rome |language=it |date=14 January 2003|access-date=12 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/09/sezioni/sport/calcio/champions_league/lilla-milan/lilla-milan/lilla-milan.html |title=Milan, bene un tempo, ma non-segna e Dida, nel finale, lo salva dai francesi |newspaper=La Repubblica |location=Rome |language=it |date=26 September 2006|access-date=12 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/calcio2002_partite_a/juventusmilan/juventusmilan/juventusmilan.html |title=La Juve travolge il Milan grinta, vittoria e sorpasso |newspaper=La Repubblica |location=Rome |language=it |date=10 November 2002|access-date=12 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/calcio2002_serie_a/ancmil/ancmil/ancmil.html |title=La forza di capitan Maldini "Non sarà l'anno dei rimpianti" |newspaper=La Repubblica |location=Rome |language=it |first=Enrico |last=Currò |date=12 April 2003|access-date=12 May 2017}}</ref>{{excessive citations inline|date=February 2023}}

After the departure of one of the club's main strikers at the beginning of the 2006–07 season, [[Andriy Shevchenko]], Ancelotti redesigned Milan's line-up, devising a 4–3–2–1 system, later known as his "Christmas Tree" formation. Milan's line-up used either [[Filippo Inzaghi]] or [[Alberto Gilardino]] as a lone striker, supported by two attacking midfielders, [[Clarence Seedorf]] and [[Kaká]], in front of a three-man midfield which once again featured Andrea Pirlo as a deep-lying playmaker, supported by two hard-working defensive midfielders, such as [[Gennaro Gattuso]], [[Massimo Ambrosini]], or [[Cristian Brocchi]].<ref name="magliarossonera" /><ref name="Filippo Inzaghi – FourFourTwo" />

Moving to Chelsea, in the [[2009–10 Chelsea F.C. season|2009–10 season]] Ancelotti continued with the 4–4–2 diamond formation used previously at Milan, often with [[Michael Essien]] or [[Mikel John Obi]] in the defensive role, [[Michael Ballack]] or [[Frank Lampard]] as box to box midfielders and [[Deco]] in a creative role, with full-backs [[Ashley Cole]] and [[José Bosingwa]] pushing forward and providing width to the narrow midfield. Later in the season the [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations|Africa Cup of Nations]] left Chelsea without strikers [[Salomon Kalou]] or [[Didier Drogba]] (as well as midfielders Essien and Mikel) and harder to play with a 4–4–2, so Ancelotti switched to the 4–3–2–1 "Christmas Tree" formation he had also used at Milan, using [[Joe Cole]] and [[Florent Malouda]] to support lone striker [[Nicolas Anelka]]. He also used the 4–2–3–1 and 4–3–3 to be less predictable and better use creative players like Lampard and Malouda.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/ancelotti-chelsea-when-carlo-came-england-first-time-around |title=Ancelotti at Chelsea: When Carlo came to England the first time around |last1=House |first1=Future Publishing Limited Quay |last2=Ambury |first2=The |date=5 October 2015 |website=FourFourTwo|access-date=18 December 2019 |last3=Engl |first3=Bath BA1 1UA All rights reserved |last4=number 2008885 |first4=Wales company registration}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/6469552/Carlo-Ancelotti-set-to-stick-with-his-Chelsea-diamond-formation.html |title=Carlo Ancelotti set to stick with his Chelsea diamond formation |journal=The Daily Telegraph |date=30 October 2009|access-date=18 December 2019 |issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/05/10/chelsea-premiership-champions-2009-10/ |title=Chelsea's Premiership win: a lesson in bringing the best out of star players |website=Zonal Marking |access-date=18 December 2019 |archive-date=9 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109021717/http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/05/10/chelsea-premiership-champions-2009-10/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

At [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]], Ancelotti similarly drew praise for his versatility; he modified the team's 4–2–3–1 formation, which had been used under [[José Mourinho]], to a 4–4–2 formation, before settling on a 4–3–3 formation, in which Argentine former winger [[Ángel Di María]] was converted to a left-sided central midfielder, while [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] was played in his preferred free role on the left wing rather than as a striker, as Ancelotti had initially intended. Di María particularly excelled in this new role and played a key role in the club's successes.<ref name="di Maria from castaway to key man at Real Madrid" /><ref name="A Ronaldo lasciavo scegliere dove giocare">{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsports.it/2016/10/25/real-madrid-ancelotti-a-ronaldo-lasciavo-scegliere-dove-giocare/ |title=Real Madrid, Ancelotti: "A Ronaldo lasciavo scegliere dove giocare" |publisher=FoxSports.it |language=it |author1=Marco Ercole |date=25 October 2016|access-date=12 May 2017}}</ref><ref name="the arch firefighter" /><ref name="brink">{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37628771/real-madrid-carlo-ancelotti-players-coach-approach-on-brink-champions-league-history |title=Real Madrid's Ancelotti, the players' coach, is on the brink of UCL history |work=ESPN.com |date=26 May 2022 |access-date=18 July 2022}}</ref> Ancelotti later explained that his use of Ronaldo in a free role on the left flank was due to the fact that the winger's style of play was less suited to a playing with his back to goal as a centre-forward; the wider role instead allowed him space to roam freely around the attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/88/spain/2016/03/19/21490722/ancelotti-ronaldo-needs-freedom-hes-not-a-striker |title=Cristiano Ronaldo needs freedom – Carlo Ancelotti |publisher=www.goal.com |last1=Webber |first1=Tom |date=19 March 2016 |access-date=3 June 2022}}</ref> Striker [[Karim Benzema]] was instead tasked with acting as a false 9 in the centre, while [[Gareth Bale]] played as an inverted winger on the opposite flank to Ronaldo.<ref name="brink" /> Although he initially sought to use an offensive-minded possession–based style, he instead adopted a quick counter-attacking style, as he noticed that his players were more suited to attacking in that manner.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2013/9/21/ancelotti-happy-with-attacking-style |title=Ancelotti happy with attacking style |work=Al Jazeera |date=21 September 2013 |access-date=31 May 2024 }}</ref>

During Ancelotti's second spell at Real Madrid, although he implemented a more simple but effective counter–attacking style with the team, Ancelotti once again earned praise in the media for his balanced approach, adaptability, and man–management abilities during the club's run to a Liga–Champions League double; his ability to develop a strong relationship with his players and his willingness to consult them on tactical decisions were singled out by several pundits in particular as reasons for the team's success and unity. Regarding this aspect of his coaching philosophy, he commented in 2022: "I think that the methodology of training in football has changed a lot in the last 20 years. So I've had to be ready to change my style and my idea of football, because the rules have changed. It's a completely different sport. But what hasn't changed is my relationship with the players. That's the same." In contrast to his first spell in the Spanish capital, Benzema was now given a free attacking role, becoming the focal point of the team's offensive line; this new role enabled the striker to be extremely prolific, which was a key component to the team's success.<ref name="brink" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.90min.com/posts/carlo-ancelotti-record-man-real-madrid-win-champions-league |title=Carlo Ancelotti: 'Record man' delighted as Real Madrid win Champions League |publisher=90min.com |date=28 May 2022 |access-date=18 July 2022 |archive-date=5 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220705190651/https://www.90min.com/posts/carlo-ancelotti-record-man-real-madrid-win-champions-league |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="secret">{{cite web |url=https://www.football-espana.net/2022/05/11/carlo-ancelotti-explains-the-secret-to-his-famed-man-management-ability |title=Carlo Ancelotti explains the secret to his famed man-management ability |publisher=Football España |last1=Feehely |first1=Alan |date=11 May 2022 |access-date=18 July 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2022/01/14/61e1c5ff22601da1418b4572.html |title=Ancelotti's counterattack that destroys possession football |publisher=MARCA |date=14 January 2022 |access-date=18 July 2022}}</ref>

In an episode of ''Universo Valdano'' in 2022, Ancelotti commented on his coaching style in the latter part of his career: "I am not an obsessive person. I like football a lot, it's a passion of mine, but I try to keep things as simple as possible. Football for me isn't complicated." He also said that he preferred to instruct his players on the defensive part of the game – as it requires more organisation – rather than the attacking aspect of the game, so as not to stifle their creativity going forward.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://onefootball.com/en/news/carlo-ancelotti-football-isnt-complicated-34987714 |title=Carlo Ancelotti: "Football isn't complicated." |work=OneFootball |date=26 April 2022 |access-date=19 April 2024}}</ref> He later also commented on his style in 2023 in comparison to other managers: "The mistakes that the new generation of coaches make is that they give too much information to the players about the game in possession. I'm old school and I think this takes a bit of creativity away. It's one thing to tell them the position without the ball, where you have to work hard and play as a team, but in possession, if they're comfortable when they come a bit wider, I'm not going to tell them to go inside. It's an individual interpretation of the game with the ball and I don't want to take away each player's creativity."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.realmadrid.com/en-US/news/football/first-team/press-conference/ancelotti-we-want-to-get-back-to-winning-ways-and-bounce-back-quickly |title=Ancelotti: "We want to get back to winning ways and bounce back quickly' |publisher=Web Oficial del Real Madrid CF |language=es |date=26 September 2023 |access-date=9 May 2024 }}</ref> However, he later dismissed criticism that he was an "old–school" manager, citing his longevity and success as evidence of his adaptability.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.football-espana.net/2023/11/17/real-madrid-manager-carlo-ancelotti-on-keeping-up-with-football-they-say-im-old-school-but-im-still-here-after-30-years |title=Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti - 'They say I'm old school, but I'm still here after 30 years' |publisher=Football España |last1=Barlow |first1=Ruairidh |language=en |date=17 November 2023 |access-date=9 May 2024 }}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[The Times]]'', in the lead-up to the [[2024 UEFA Champions League final|2024 Champions League final]], Ancelotti commented on the limits of teams having "only one identity," also adding that his "style" was "not recognised" because he changed. He said that against [[Roberto De Zerbi]]'s [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]], en route to his last Champions League title, he instructed his players not to press them, so that they would not play through the team. He similarly demonstrated that his team defended in a low block against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in the knock-out stages, as he saw that as the most effective way to defeat them, but that normally his side are more offensive. He elaborated that during the current season he used a [[Formation (association football)#4–3–1–2|4–3–1–2]] without a genuine forward, in order to compensate for the departure of striker Benzema. [[Jude Bellingham]] served as a goalscoring attacking midfielder, with additional creative and defensive responsibilities, acting almost as a [[Forward (association football)#False 9|false-9]] or second striker at times, and playing behind [[Vinícius Júnior]] and [[Rodrygo]] – normally wingers – upfront in free roles. Bellingham flourished in this position, with Ancelotti earning praise from Ben Grounds of ''[[Sky Sports]]'' for fielding him in this new role. While Vinícius and Rodrygo were still given the freedom to move out wide in attack, Ancelotti also focused on developing their ability to play more effectively in central areas.

In 2015, Miguel Delaney of ''ESPN'' concluded that Ancelotti's more relaxed management style is more suited to winning cup competitions that are "far more open to blind luck and all the one-off nuances," in contrast to autocratic managers like [[Pep Guardiola]], [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]], and José Mourinho, who have amassed better domestic records and more league championships. Ancelotti himself has also referenced this discrepancy in the title of his autobiography, which translates to "I prefer Cups".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/37416978/carlo-ancelotti-success-europe-tainted-lack-domestic-titles |title=Delaney: Ancelotti falls short domestically |work=ESPN.com |date=27 March 2015 |access-date=22 April 2024}}</ref>

Ancelotti's 2024–25 season was notably marked by four consecutive defeats to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] under [[Hansi Flick]], across La Liga, the [[2024 Supercopa de España final]], the Copa del Rey final, and a late-season league encounter. The matches exposed structural weaknesses in Ancelotti's typically balanced 4–3–3 system, particularly when facing high-intensity pressing and rapid wide transitions.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Flick's Barcelona exposed Ancelotti's Real Madrid: Tactical review of four Clásicos |url=https://totalfootballanalysis.com/match-analysis/barcelona-real-madrid-ancelotti-vs-flick-tactical-breakdown-2024-25 |website=Total Football Analysis |date=12 May 2025 |access-date=12 May 2025}}</ref> Flick's Barcelona consistently targeted the space behind Madrid's advancing full-backs, using wide overloads and fast switches of play to isolate Real's defenders.  Ancelotti's midfield trio often struggled to cope with the verticality of Barcelona's attacking patterns, particularly when pressed into transitional moments.<ref>{{cite web |title=Barcelona 5–2 Real Madrid: Flick's pressing triggers and Madrid's structural flaws |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/13/flick-barcelona-vs-ancelotti-real-madrid-supercopa-analysis |website=The Guardian |date=13 January 2025 |access-date=12 May 2025}}</ref> Despite [[Kylian Mbappé]]'s individual brilliance in the final La Liga match, including scoring a hat-trick, Madrid's defensive line was repeatedly caught high and exposed by diagonal runs from [[Lamine Yamal]] and [[Raphinha]].<ref name="aljazeera.com"/> The sequence of defeats sparked criticism of Ancelotti's reluctance to adapt tactically, with analysts noting his adherence to familiar patterns even as Barcelona's pressing traps and wide combinations consistently unbalanced his team.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flick's clean sweep over Ancelotti: Lessons from a one-sided Clásico season |url=https://barcauniversal.com/flick-clean-sweep-ancelotti-barcelona-real-madrid-tactical-lessons |website=Barça Universal |date=12 May 2025 |access-date=12 May 2025}}</ref> The four defeats were viewed as a rare blemish on Ancelotti's otherwise pragmatic and adaptive managerial reputation.

Ancelotti has two children: a daughter, and a son, [[Davide Ancelotti|Davide]], who was his assistant coach at Everton and Real Madrid.
