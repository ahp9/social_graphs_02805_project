===Borussia Dortmund===
After leaving Motherwell, an agent arranged trial spells for Lambert with [[PSV Eindhoven]] and [[Borussia Dortmund]].<ref name = bosman/> PSV did not sign Lambert as they were looking for a [[winger (association football)|winger]], but he signed for Dortmund after a pre-season tournament.<ref name = bosman/> Dortmund manager [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]] had previously been impressed by Lambert when the club had played Motherwell in the [[1994–95 UEFA Cup]].<ref name=butler>{{cite web |last=Butler |first=Michael |date=19 January 2025 |title=Paul Lambert: 'Zinedine Zidane just looked at me and said "bloody hell"' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/19/paul-lambert-interview-dortmund-motherwell-celtic-zidane |website=[[theguardian.com]] |access-date=20 January 2025}}</ref> Portuguese international [[Paulo Sousa]] had also signed for Dortmund that summer.<ref name = bosman/> Sousa had been expected to play in Lambert's position, but Lambert performed well in early Bundesliga matches and kept a place in the team.<ref name = bosman/>

Dortmund had been the German champions in the previous two seasons, but struggled to keep pace with [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in [[1996–97 Bundesliga|1996–97]],<ref name = bosman/> eventually finishing third in the Bundesliga.<ref name=butler /> In the [[1996–97 UEFA Champions League]], though, Dortmund progressed through the group stage as runners-up.<ref name = bosman/> They then beat Auxerre and [[Manchester United]] to reach the [[1997 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League final]], against [[Juventus FC|Juventus]].<ref name = bosman/> He had scored one goal during the group stage, the first in a 2–2 draw at [[Widzew Łódź]]. His performance in the semi-final elimination of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], when Dortmund were missing several key players due to injuries,<ref name=butler /> was later praised in the [[autobiography]] of United midfielder [[Roy Keane]].

==International career==

During Lambert's international career, he was involved in a memorable Under-21 game against Germany. The [[Scotland national under-21 football team|young Scots]] drew 1–1 in [[Bochum]] in the [[1992 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]] quarter-finals. In the return leg at [[Pittodrie]], Germany were two up after 40 minutes before [[Duncan Ferguson]] set up [[Ray McKinnon (footballer)|Ray McKinnon]] to pull one back before half-time. Germany scored a third on the hour mark to seemingly put the tie out of reach. However, on 68 minutes, [[Gerry Creaney]] headed past [[Stefan Klos]] before Lambert himself equalised ten minutes later. [[Alex Rae (footballer, born 1969)|Alex Rae]] scored two minutes from time to clinch the game 4–3.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.afc.co.uk/articles/20100905/scotland-u21s-at-pittodrie_2212158_2144874 | title = Scotland U-21s at Pittodrie | publisher = afc.co.uk | date = 5 September 2010 | access-date = 8 April 2012 | first = Kevin | last = Stirling | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130602074202/http://www.afc.co.uk/articles/20100905/scotland-u21s-at-pittodrie_2212158_2144874 | archive-date = 2 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

As a full [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] international, Lambert won 40&nbsp;[[cap (sport)|caps]], scoring one goal.<ref name = "sfa"/> In the latter part of his international career, he captained the side 15 times. His international debut came whilst at Motherwell and awarded by [[Craig Brown (footballer, born 1940)|Craig Brown]] in the [[1995 Kirin Cup]] against host country, [[Japan national football team|Japan]].<ref name = "sfa"/> Lambert played a second game in the tournament three days later against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]].<ref name = "sfa"/>

Whilst at Dortmund and during the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification]] campaign Lambert started to appear as a regular. After missing the opening game of the campaign against [[Austria national football team|Austria]], Lambert appeared as a 46th-minute substitute in the 2–0 win in [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] in October 1996. He was also in the starting line-up for the next fixture against [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] in [[Tallinn]] four days later, but a scheduling dispute meant the home team did not adhere to a quickly-rearranged afternoon kick-off time, and [[One team in Tallinn|the match was abandoned at kick-off]] with no caps awarded to the Scotland players (the fixture was re-arranged for the following February, but Lambert was an unused substitute).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/one-team-tallinn-when-scotland-kicked-against-nobody-and-still-didnt-win |title=One team in Tallinn: when Scotland kicked off against nobody – and still didn't win |first=John |last=Brewin |work=[[FourFourTwo]] |date=10 October 2014 |access-date=14 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rsssf.org/tabless/scot-intres2001.html|title=Scotland - International Matches 1996-2001|author=Alan Brown and Gabriele Tossani |date=13 December 2018|website=[[RSSSF]]|access-date=14 October 2019 }}</ref> He was again a substitute in the next qualifier which was played, coming on in the 46th minute of a 1–0 home win against [[Sweden men's national football team|Sweden]]. For his next cap, he was promoted to the starting line-up for a 2–0 home victory in the qualifier against Austria. Lambert's only defeat of the campaign was the 2–1 reversal in [[Gothenburg]] against Sweden before two wins against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] and a second 2–0 win against Latvia clinched qualification.

He played in all three of Scotland's matches at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], a 2–1 defeat against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the tournament's opening match, a 1–1 draw against [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and a 3–0 defeat against [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]].<ref name = "sfa">{{SFA Profile|id=1498}}</ref>

Lambert was part of the Scotland side that won away against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in April 1999 with the goal scored by [[Don Hutchison]]. Lambert and Scotland qualified for a play-off place in the [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying]] campaign, but Lambert missed the play-offs against [[England national football team|England]] due to suffering an injury in the [[Old Firm]] game played the weekend before. Craig Brown cited Lambert's absence as crucial to England's progression at Scotland's expense, since he intended to deploy Lambert directly against [[Paul Scholes]], scorer of both England goals.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/other-sports-news/england-0-scotland-1-is-it-really-10-years-since-don-hutchison-s-goal-at-wembley-1.932090 | title = England 0 Scotland 1: Is it really 10 years since Don Hutchison's goal at Wembley? | work = The Herald|location=Glasgow | date = 14 November 2009 | access-date =8 April 2012 | first = Darryl | last = Broadfoot}}</ref>

===Colchester United===
On 9 October 2008, he was appointed as manager of [[Football League One|League One]] team [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] to succeed [[Geraint Williams]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cu-fc.com/page/News/0,,10424~1417363,00.html | title = Exclusive: U's Appoint Lambert | date = 9 October 2008 | publisher=Colchester United F.C. | access-date = 8 April 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120415075501/http://www.cu-fc.com/page/News/0%2C%2C10424~1417363%2C00.html | archive-date = 15 April 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> before winning his first game 2–1 at [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]].

Lambert kept his job despite the poor run as the team flirted with the relegation places continuously over the next few months. Lambert did however manage to get Villa to record back-to-back wins for the first time since May 2011, as they defeated fellow relegation rivals [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] and [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21639183 |title=Reading 1–2 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 March 2013 |access-date=7 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21724358 |title=Aston Villa 3–2 QPR |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 March 2013 |access-date=7 April 2013}}</ref> He then oversaw the club's biggest victory since 2008, as Villa thrashed [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] 6–1.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22244165 |title=Aston Villa 6–1 Sunderland |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 April 2013 |access-date=23 May 2013}}</ref> Villa finished 15th with the youngest starting eleven in the Premier League, leading to praise from pundit [[Alan Hansen]], who said that Lambert was "a contender for Manager of the Season."<ref name="birminghammail.co.uk">{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-paul-lambert-created-3902085 |title=Lambo puts a spring in Villa's step |work=Birmingham Mail |date=21 May 2013 |access-date=23 May 2013}}</ref> Highlights of the season included Lambert's summer acquisition of star striker [[Christian Benteke]], the introduction of Villa's Player of the Season, goalkeeper [[Brad Guzan]], reaching the semi-finals of the League Cup and securing Villa's place in the Premier League for the 2013–14 season.<ref name="birminghammail.co.uk"/>

{{main|2013–14 Aston Villa F.C. season}}
Lambert's Aston Villa side began the season brightly, with a 3–1 win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[Emirates Stadium]] on 17 August.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/23644714 |title=Arsenal 1–3 Aston Villa |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> Towards the end of 2013, the performances worsened greatly, especially home form, and Lambert was criticised by many fans and pundits for putting out a counter-attacking side with no plan B. Possession stats were biased towards the opposition in many games, including at home to Swansea; Villa had less than 30 percent of possession in a game which ended 1–1. In January 2014, Lambert made headlines by claiming that "many Premier League clubs could do without the distraction of the [[FA Cup]] if they were being honest." Aston Villa subsequently lost 2–1 at home to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], a team two divisions below them, marking the fourth consecutive year that Lambert has been eliminated from the FA Cup by lower league opposition.

====2014–15 season====
{{main|2014–15 Aston Villa F.C. season}}
Lambert's third season in charge saw a different approach in the transfer market, with him opting to buy players with experience as opposed to the previous seasons, where the club would sign young prospects. Aston Villa started off well, with a 1–0 victory over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]. This was then followed by a 0–0 draw against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], a 2–1 win over [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and a 1–0 victory over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. During this time, the new back four of [[Alan Hutton]], [[Ron Vlaar]], [[Philippe Senderos]] and [[Aly Cissokho]] was praised by Lambert after gaining three clean sheets out of a possible four, whilst gaining ten points out of an available 12.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

After Villa's good start to the season, however, they then went on to have a five-game long goal drought, losing to Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and QPR before scoring in a 2–1 loss at Villa Park to Tottenham.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/313478|title= Tottenham beat 10-man Aston Villa 2–1 after Christian Benteke sees red|work=Sky Sports|date=2 November 2014}}</ref> Villa then went on to gain some valuable points, drawing 0–0 with West Ham and 1–1 against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].
