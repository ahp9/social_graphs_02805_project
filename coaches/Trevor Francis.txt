'''Trevor John Francis''' (19 April 1954 – 24 July 2023) was an English [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for a number of clubs in England, the United States, Italy, Scotland and Australia. In 1979 he became Britain's first £1&nbsp;million player following his transfer from [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. He scored the winning goal for Forest in the [[1979 European Cup Final|1979 European Cup final]] against [[Malmö FF|Malmö]]. He won the European Cup again with the club the following year.<ref name="European Cup" /> At international level, he played for [[England national football team|England]] 52 times between 1976 and 1986, scoring 12 goals, and played at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]].

Between 1988 and 2003, Francis was [[manager (association football)|manager]] of [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], Birmingham City and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].

==Early life and education==
Trevor John Francis was born on 19 April 1954 in [[Plymouth]], [[Devon]].<ref name="TF birthday" /><ref name="Guardian obit" /><ref name=EFO /> His father, Roy, was a shift foreman with the local [[gas board]] and played football semi-professionally, his mother, Phyllis, did part-time sewing and [[tailoring]], and he had two younger siblings.<ref name="prodigies" /><ref name="Guardian obit" /> Francis was educated at Pennycross primary school and Plymouth's Public Secondary School for Boys.<ref name="Telegraph obit">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2023/07/24/trevor-francis-birmingham-european-cup-nottingham-forest/ |title=Trevor Francis, Nottingham Forest and England striker who became Britain's first £1 million player – obituary |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=24 July 2023 |access-date=20 November 2023}}</ref> As a schoolboy, he was a prolific goalscorer;<ref name="Guardian obit" /> at 14, he attended a [[The Football Association|Football Association]] course at the [[National Sports Centre (Sport England)|National Sports Centre]] at [[Bisham Abbey]], and he joined [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] as a 15-year-old school-leaver.<ref name="Telegraph obit" />

==Club career==
===Birmingham City===
Francis quickly rose in status, making his debut for Birmingham City's first team in 1970, aged just 16. His talent was noted when, before his 17th birthday, he scored four goals in a match against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].<ref name="prodigies">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/aug/02/joy-of-six-sporting-prodigies |title=The Joy of Six: sporting prodigies |website=The Guardian|first=Daniel |last=Taylor |date=2 August 2013 |access-date=24 July 2018}}</ref> He ended his first season with 15 goals from just 22 games.<ref name="ENFA player" /> Birmingham City manager at the time, [[Freddie Goodwin]], compared Francis to both [[Jimmy Greaves]] and [[Denis Law]].<ref name=bbcobit>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/66293698 |title=Trevor Francis obit: A 'wonderful person', 'fabulous team-mate' & record breaker |first=Alex |last=Bysouth |website=BBC Sport |date=24 July 2023 |access-date=30 July 2023}}</ref>

On 30 October 1976, he scored one of Birmingham's most famous goals, when he turned away from the touchline and cut inside two [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] [[Defender (association football)|defenders]], constantly being forced backwards, before suddenly unleashing a {{convert|25|yard|m|abbr=out|adj=on}} shot.<ref name="Guardian Wilson">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/24/trevor-francis-brian-clough-nottingham-forest-england |title=Remember Trevor Francis for what he achieved, not what might have been |first=Jonathan |last=Wilson |website=The Guardian | date=24 July 2023 |access-date=30 July 2023}}</ref>

===Detroit Express===
Francis negotiated a loan from Birmingham in 1978 to play for the [[Detroit Express]] in the [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL),<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/birmingham-evening-mail-tf-to-detroit/128910140/ |title=Francis signs on with Hill |first=Ray |last=Matts |newspaper=Evening Mail |location=Birmingham |date=13 April 1978 |page=60 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> where he scored 22 goals in 19 league matches and was named in the NASL first XI alongside [[Franz Beckenbauer]] and [[Giorgio Chinaglia]] before returning home to the [[Midlands]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/detroit-free-press-1978-nasl-all-stars/128912173/ |title=Express' Trevor on NASL all-stars |newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=20 August 1978 |page=2E |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>

===Nottingham Forest===
[[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], the [[1977–78 Football League|reigning First Division champions]] and [[1977–78 Football League Cup|League Cup]] holders managed by [[Brian Clough]], put in a bid for Francis which totalled just over £1&nbsp;million. No player had ever been sold between English clubs for a seven-figure fee before (the erstwhile record was less than half), and the deal was sealed, with Francis famously being introduced to the media by a manager impatient to play [[Squash (sport)|squash]]; Clough was in his red gym kit and carrying a [[racquet]] as he addressed the press conference.<ref name="UEFA Francis">{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefasupercup/history/season=1979/ |title=1979: Burns' night for Forest |publisher=UEFA |access-date=29 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413035802/http://www.uefa.com/uefasupercup/history/season=1979/index.html |archive-date=13 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="Telegraph Briggs">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/nottingham-forest/4560618/The-day-Trevor-Francis-broke-footballs-1m-mark.html |title=The day Trevor Francis broke football's £1m mark |first=Simon |last=Briggs |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=9 February 2009 |access-date=24 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724213404/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/nottingham-forest/4560618/The-day-Trevor-Francis-broke-footballs-1m-mark.html |archive-date=24 July 2018 |url-access=registration |url-status=live |quote=Francis is still remembered as the man who went for a million, yet never quite lived up to his billing.}}</ref>

While recognised as the first British million-pound player,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1979/may/31/championsleague.sport |title=Forest reach the summit |first=David |last=Lacey |newspaper=The Guardian |date=31 May 1979 |access-date=24 July 2018}}</ref> the actual transfer fee for the player was £1,150,000, including 15% commission to the Football League. Clough wrote in his autobiography that the fee was £999,999, as he wanted to ensure the million-pound milestone did not go to the player's head; although Francis says that was a [[tongue-in-cheek]] remark by Clough.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://utv.vo.llnwd.net/o16/talkSPORT/20110427_1000_LA.mp3 |title=Trevor Francis interview, Talksport Radio – Keys and Gray – 27 April 2011 |publisher=TalkSport |date=27 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323075607/http://utv.vo.llnwd.net/o16/talkSPORT/20110427_1000_LA.mp3 |archive-date=23 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Clough: The Autobiography |first=Brian |last=Clough |publisher=Corgi |date=1995 |pages=190–191 |isbn=9781409045427 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXMhl6mgmYEC&pg=PA190}}</ref>

The ball was spread to Forest's [[winger (association football)|winger]] [[John Robertson (footballer, born 1953)|John Robertson]] wide on the left and he took on two defenders at once to reach the byline and curl an awkward, outswinging [[Cross (association football)|cross]] towards the far post. Francis had already begun to sprint into position, but even so he had to increase his pace in order to reach the cross as it dropped, and ended up throwing himself low at the ball. He connected with his head and the ball diverted powerfully into the roof of the net.<ref>{{cite book |title=Clough: The Autobiography |first=Brian |last=Clough |publisher=Corgi |date=1995 |pages=190–191 |isbn=9781409045427 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXMhl6mgmYEC&pg=PA190}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11727/9927376/watch-trevor-francis-my-greatest-game |title=Watch: Trevor Francis – My Greatest Game |website=Sky Sports |date=10 September 2015 |access-date=30 July 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.extratime.com/articles/14425/oneill-recalls-forest-european-cup-victory/ |title=O'Neill recalls Forest European Cup victory |first=Fran |last=Reilly |website=ExtraTime.ie |date=6 June 2015 |access-date=30 July 2023}}</ref> Forest won the match 1–0 and footage of the goal was used in the opening titles to ''[[Match of the Day]]'' for some years afterwards.

Even though the season ended there, Francis duly headed back to Detroit for another summer playing in the NASL, where once again he was named to the first XI alongside [[Johan Cruyff]] ([[Los Angeles Aztecs]]) and [[Giorgio Chinaglia]] ([[New York Cosmos (1971–1985)|New York Cosmos]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://soccerhistoryusa.org/asha/year/1979.html |title=The Year in American Soccer – 1979 |website=Soccer History USA |access-date=29 July 2023}}</ref> despite playing only half the season. In his brief NASL career, Francis scored 36 goals in 33 regular season matches and had 18 assists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/nasl/naslstar.html |title=Top international stars in the NASL, 1967–1984: Part 1: Player Biographies, A–H |first=Dave |last=Litterer |website=USA Soccer History Archives |date=29 January 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512025157/http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/nasl/naslstar.html |archive-date=12 May 2008}}</ref>

At Nottingham Forest Clough frequently played Francis on the [[Forward (association football)#Winger|right wing]], rather than in his preferred position as a [[Centre forward|central attacker]].<ref name="Guardian Wilson"/><ref>{{cite book |title=The Undisputed Champions of Europe |first=Steven |last=Scragg |publisher=Pitch Publishing |location=Durrington |date=2021 |page=158 |isbn=9781801500371 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBdkEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA158}}</ref> Francis was in the side which lost the [[1980 Football League Cup Final|1980 League Cup Final]] to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], but missed the [[1980 European Cup Final|European Cup Final]] against [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg]] due to an injury to his [[Achilles tendon]].<ref name="ENFA player"/><ref name=Achilles>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-daily-telegraph-francis-achilles/129077695/ |title=Francis injury dents Forest's European hopes |first=Donald |last=Saunders |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=5 May 1980 |page=19 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> Somehow the success of his Forest career never quite reflected his huge fee:<ref name="Telegraph Briggs"/><ref name="Guardian Wilson"/> he scored only 14 league goals in the [[1979–80 Nottingham Forest F.C. season|1979–80 season]] and 6 in the next 18 games that he played for Forest.<ref name="ENFA player"/> Although still a regular for England, his Achilles injury prevented him being in the squad for the [[1980 European Football Championship|1980 European Championships]].<ref name=Achilles/>

===Manchester City===
The injury kept Francis out of the game for over six months. He was sold to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in September 1981, this time for £1.2&nbsp;million.<ref name="James345">{{cite book |first=Gary |last=James |title=Manchester: The Greatest City |publisher=Polar |location=Leicester |date=2002 |page=345 |isbn=1-899538-22-4}}</ref> The deal caused behind-the-scenes friction at Manchester City. During negotiations City chairman [[Peter Swales]] informed manager [[John Bond (footballer)|John Bond]] that the club could not afford the transfer fee. Bond then issued an ultimatum: if Francis did not sign, Bond would resign.<ref name="James345"/> Francis made a promising start at the club, scoring two goals against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on his debut, but over the course of the season he was frequently injured.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gjaIAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT127 |title=Manchester City Player by Player |first=Tony |last=Matthews |publisher=Amberley |location=Stroud |date=2013 |page=127 |isbn=978-1445617374}}</ref> In total he scored 12 goals in 26 games and made the England squad for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]].<ref name=bbcobit/>

Back at his club, financial problems were again an issue. Francis' contract gave him a salary of £100,000 plus bonuses, which the club could no longer afford to pay to a player who regularly sustained injuries.<ref name="James347">James, ''Manchester: The Greatest City''. p. 347.</ref>

===Sampdoria===
Later that summer, Francis was approached by Italian club [[UC Sampdoria|Sampdoria]], who paid Manchester City £700,000 for his services.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ET-fDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT44 |title=Caught Beneath the Landslide: Manchester City in the 1990s |first=Tim |last=Rich |publisher=deCoubertin Books |location=Liverpool |date=2018 |isbn=978-1-909245-80-8}}</ref> He helped win the [[1984–85 Coppa Italia]], in the same team as [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] midfielder [[Graeme Souness]], by scoring 9 goals in 11 games (top scorer of the Cup). It was the first time that Sampdoria had won the competition.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/55772/look-back-time |title=A look back in time |first=Dave |last=Ellington |website=Football Italia |date=11 September 2014 |access-date=25 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913113300/https://football-italia.net/55772/look-back-time |archive-date=13 September 2014}}</ref>

===Atalanta===
Francis joined [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] in 1986. He played 21 league games and scored once in [[1986–87 Serie A|his only season]], but added two goals in nine games in the [[Coppa Italia]]; Atalanta lost [[1987 Coppa Italia final|the final]] to [[SSC Napoli|Napoli]]. He was the second Englishman at the [[Bergamo]]-based club after [[Gerry Hitchens]], and by the time of his death their only other English-born player was [[Ademola Lookman]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Mondo del calcio in lutto: è morto Trevor Francis, aveva giocato anche nell'Atalanta|trans-title=Football world in mourning: Trevor Francis has died, he had also played for Atalanta|url=https://www.bergamonews.it/2023/07/24/mondo-del-calcio-in-lutto-e-morto-trevor-francis-aveva-giocato-anche-nellatalanta/617350/ |access-date=24 July 2023 |website=Bergamo News |date=24 July 2023 |language=Italian}}</ref>

===Rangers===
Francis returned to Britain in September 1987 to join [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] under Graeme Souness. Numerous English players were brought to the Scottish club by Souness as English clubs had been banned from European competition since the [[Heysel disaster]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=McKay |first1=Gabriel |title=Graeme Souness' 8 biggest Rangers moments as Ibrox legend eyes return |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/graeme-souness-8-biggest-rangers-21774534 |access-date=24 July 2023 |work=Daily Record |date=29 March 2020}}</ref> Francis cost just £75,000, signed on a "pay-as-you-play" basis, and won the [[1987–88 Scottish League Cup]], scoring a penalty in the shootout.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://therangersarchives.co.uk/francis-trevor/ |title=Trevor Francis |website=The Rangers Archives |access-date=29 July 2023}}</ref>

===Queens Park Rangers===
Francis signed for [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] on a free transfer in March 1988 and helped the team finish fifth in the First Division.<ref name="QPR Obit">{{cite web |url=https://www.qpr.co.uk/news/2023/july/28/remembering-trevor-francis/ |title=Remembering Trevor Francis |first=Chris |last=Guy |publisher=Queens Park Rangers F.C. |date=28 July 2023 |access-date=29 July 2023}}</ref> He scored 10 goals from 26 appearances in the first half of the 1988–89 season and took over as player-manager in December 1988 when [[Jim Smith (footballer, born 1940)|Jim Smith]] moved to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], but a knee injury in January 1989 put an end to his playing season.<ref name="QPR Obit"/> He marked his return to the field in September 1989 with a hat-trick against [[Aston Villa]],<ref name="QPR Obit"/> but was replaced as manager by [[Don Howe]] in November 1989 and his playing contract was paid up a few days later.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/ealing-and-acton-gazette-after-francis/129067488/ |title=Rangers go Continental |first=Graham |last=Metcalf |newspaper=Ealing & Acton Gazette |date=1 December 1989 |page=60 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>

In March 1989, QPR player [[Martin Allen]] left the preparations for a game away at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in order to witness the birth of his son. Francis fined him two weeks' wages, a decision that was condemned by the British press and discussed in Parliament. Francis expressed remorse, but never recovered the trust of Allen, who left for West Ham at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news |title=The jury is still out on Francis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/feb/27/newsstory.sport6 |access-date=25 April 2025 |work=The Guardian |date=27 February 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Which football managers have followed legends with instant success? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/23/which-football-managers-have-followed-legends-with-instant-success-the-knowledge |access-date=25 April 2025 |work=The Guardian |date=23 April 2025}}</ref>

During his time at Queens Park Rangers, Francis completed a brief loan in 1988 with an Australian [[National Soccer League]] team, [[Wollongong Wolves FC|Wollongong City]], as part of businessman [[Harry Michaels]]' attempt to market football in Australia.

Francis left QPR in February 1990 to play for [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]; despite gaining a good reputation amongst supporters, he could not help the club avoid relegation to the second tier under manager [[Ron Atkinson]] for the [[1990–91 Football League|1990–91 season]].<ref>{{cite web | last=Sutcliffe | first=Richard | title=25 years ago: 'Injustice' of relegation still rankles with Atkinson 25 years on | website=Yorkshire Post | date=5 May 2015 | url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/sheffield-united/25-years-ago-injustice-of-relegation-still-rankles-with-atkinson-25-years-on-1819227 | access-date=29 July 2023}}</ref> However, that season he helped Wednesday win the [[1990–91 Football League Cup|League Cup]], although he was a non-playing [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] in the final, and also gained promotion back to the top flight.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.swfc.co.uk/news/2023/july/rip-trevor-francis/ |title=RIP Trevor Francis |publisher=Sheffield Wednesday F.C. |date=24 July 2023 |access-date=30 July 2023}}</ref><ref name="ENFA player"/>

==Managerial career==
===Sheffield Wednesday===
After the departure of [[Ron Atkinson]], Francis took over as manager of Sheffield Wednesday with popular support from club and supporters. He guided Wednesday to third-place finish in 1992.<ref>{{cite web | last1=Whaling | first1=James | last2=Lloyd | first2=Howard | title=Trevor Francis dies aged 69 | website=WalesOnline | date=24 July 2023 | url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/trevor-francis-dies-aged-69-27384407 | access-date=24 July 2023}}</ref> The following year, Wednesday reached the [[1993 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]] and [[1993 Football League Cup Final|League Cup finals]], losing both to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], the former after a replay.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/sport/football/news/sheffield-wednesday-arsenal-fa-cup-18281115 |title=How Arsenal wrecked Sheffield Wednesday's fourth visit to Wembley in quick succession in 1993 |first=Dom |last=Howson |website=Yorkshire Live |date=20 May 2020 |access-date=30 July 2023}}</ref> In 1994, Francis finally retired as a player, shortly before his 40th birthday.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/66287307 |title=Trevor Francis: Ex-England player and Britain's first £1m footballer dies aged 69 |website=BBC Sport |date=24 July 2023 |access-date=30 July 2023}}</ref> He was dismissed as manager a year later after Wednesday finished 13th in the Premiership.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/sheffield-wednesday/sheffield-wednesday-never-recovered-since-1995-sacking-of-trevor-francis-2857365 |title=Sheffield Wednesday never recovered since 1995 sacking of Trevor Francis |first=Leon |last=Wobschall |newspaper=The Yorkshire Post |date=19 May 2020 |access-date=30 July 2023}}</ref>

In February 1992, Francis brought former French international [[Eric Cantona]] back from a poor discipline enforced hiatus in his career by inviting him for a trial at Sheffield Wednesday. However, as the snowy conditions meant that he could only evaluate Cantona on [[AstroTurf]], Francis requested an extension to the trial to see whether Cantona could play on grass.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mightyleeds.co.uk/players/cantona2.htm |title=Players: Eric Cantona Part 2 – Ooh, aah, cantona! |website=The Mighty Mighty Whites: The Definitive History of Leeds United |access-date=24 July 2018}}</ref> An outraged Cantona walked out on The Owls and was signed (without a trial) by [[Leeds United]], inspiring first them and then Manchester United to success. In a 2012 interview Francis said that he had agreed to take Cantona on as a favour to Francis' former agent, Dennis Roach, and [[Michel Platini]], who he knew from his time playing in Italy, when they approached him about taking on Cantona, and that it was intended as an opportunity for Cantona to put himself in the "shop window": Wednesday had only recently been promoted back to the top flight, with most of the squad still being on Second Division-level wages, and the club could not afford to sign him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/exclusive-francis-sets-the-record-straight-on-why-sheffield-wednesday-did-not-sign-cantona-1-4470843 |title=Exclusive: Francis sets the record straight on why Sheffield Wednesday did not sign Cantona |last=Hercock |first=Richard |date=21 April 2012 |newspaper=The Yorkshire Post |access-date=3 November 2018}}</ref>

===Birmingham City===
Francis was hired by Birmingham City as manager in 1996, with the club in the First Division (the equivalent of the old Second Division, now known as the EFL Championship). He guided Birmingham to 10th- and 7th-place finishes in his first two seasons, missing out on the playoffs on goal difference in the latter. Finishes of 4th, 4th and 5th in the next three seasons resulted in playoff entry, losing each time.<ref name=nearly>{{cite news |title=Francis the nearly man |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/birmingham_city/1338066.stm |access-date=24 July 2023 |work=BBC Sport |date=18 May 2001}}</ref>

Francis led Blues to the [[2001 Football League Cup Final|2001 League Cup Final]], in which they lost on penalties to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. He was dismissed in October that year. [[BBC Sport]] wrote "Francis the player was legendary. Francis the manager is the nearly man".<ref name=nearly/>

===Crystal Palace===
Francis was manager of [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]  from November 2001 to April 2003.<ref name="Named Palace">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/nov/30/newsstory.sport5 |title=Palace name Francis as manager |first=Dan |last=Rookwood |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 November 2001 |access-date=29 July 2023}}</ref><ref name="Sacked Palace"/> He was appointed by Crystal Palace chairman, [[Simon Jordan]] to replace [[Steve Bruce]] who had resigned as Crystal Palace manager with the intention of taking the manager's role at Birmingham City. Litigation had followed with Bruce being placed on "[[gardening leave]]".<ref>{{cite web | last=Harris | first=Nick | title=Palace win injunction against Bruce | website=The Independent | date=23 November 2001 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/palace-win-injunction-against-bruce-9201022.html | access-date=29 July 2023}}</ref> Of the appointment Jordan said, "The last two or three weeks have not been easy. I'm bored of Steve Bruce and Birmingham and what I'm interested in is Trevor Francis and Crystal Palace." At the time Francis said that he had turned down four jobs before accepting the role at Crystal Palace.<ref name="Named Palace" /> Under his managership, Palace defeated a [[Gerard Houllier]]-managed [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in an FA Cup fourth round replay at [[Anfield]] in February 2003<ref>{{cite web | title=Palace stun Liverpool | website=BBC Sport | date=13 February 2003 | url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/2708843.stm | access-date=29 July 2023}}</ref> and beat Palace's main rivals, [[Brighton & Hove Albion]], 5–0 in October 2002.<ref>{{cite book |title=Crystal Palace: A Complete Record 1905–2011 |last=King |first=Ian |date=April 2012 |pages=221, 420–23 |publisher=Derby Books |isbn=9781780910468}}</ref> However, after the team's second failure to achieve promotion to the Premier League, Simon Jordan dismissed him, stating: "People know I am very unhappy with the selection of our players under Francis. We have a very strong squad and we should have done a lot better this season – a lot of lessons need to be learned from injury prevention and transfer policy."<ref name="Sacked Palace">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/apr/19/newsstory.sport4 |title=Francis sacked for failing to decorate Jordan's Palace |first=Dominic |last=Fifield |newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 April 2003 |access-date=29 July 2023}}</ref>

==Personal life==
