Clemence played internationally for [[England national football team|England]] from 1972 to 1983, and represented the country at [[UEFA Euro 1980]] and the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]].

After brief spells as joint-manager at Tottenham (alongside [[Doug Livermore]]) and sole manager at [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in the first half of the 90s, he acted as head of the FA Development Team, overseeing the development made by players in the England youth teams from under-16 to 21 level, having previously been part of the England senior team's backroom staff.<ref name="FA">{{cite web | url=http://www.thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Staff/ray-clemence | title=Ray Clemence | work=The FA | access-date=4 November 2013}}</ref>

== Club career ==
=== Scunthorpe United ===
Born in [[Skegness]], Lincolnshire, Clemence played eight matches on trial for [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], but was ultimately not signed by the [[Meadow Lane]] club.<ref>Shoot Magazine, 27 August issue, 1977. Retrieved 3 December 2020.</ref> He was spotted by [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] whilst playing in a county-cup final at their [[Old Showground]] ground for his local youth club Skegness Cosmos. After starring in the Cosmos' 4-3 victory,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdMxL_zkN_4|title=18 Holes with Ray Clemence in Dubai &#124; Vidcast #4|access-date=14 November 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Clemence was invited for formal trials with ''The Iron'', which he duly passed.<ref name="sm1979">Soccer Monthly, August 1979, Interview with John Keith (Daily Express). Retrieved 3 December 2020.</ref> Clemence went on to sign professional terms for Scunthorpe on his 17th birthday, 5 August 1965, shortly before the start of Scunthorpe's [[1965–66 Football League|1965–66]] [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] campaign.<ref name="sm1979"/>

Despite initially playing in the club's 'third team',<ref name="smp2020-11">''Scunthorpe United Football Club'' Scunthorpe United vs Morecambe and Bolton Wanderers official match programme. 21st-24 November 2020. Retrieved 3 December 2020.</ref> Clemence's big break arrived later in his debut season – making his professional debut in a 1–1 draw at home to [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea Town]] on 2 April 1966. Prior to this debut, Clemence remembers a key behind-the-scenes intervention from two Scunthorpe coaches: "[[Jack Brownsword]] and Alan Bushby pulled me aside, gave me a pep talk and told me they thought I could play for England one day but 'you've got to work at it'".<ref name="smp2020-11"/>

Clemence went on to make four appearances in total throughout his debut season,<ref name="nutstoiron">Staff, John. (17 October 2012). ''From Nuts to Iron - The Official History of Scunthorpe United 1899-2012''. Yore Publications p236</ref> including earning his first professional clean sheet in a 1–0 victory away at [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]].<ref name="bell2020">Bell, Max (31 August 2020). ''Scunthorpe United: 20 Legends.'' Vertical Editions. p88. {{ISBN|978-1-9088471-9-5}}</ref> Having spent much of that season as understudy to the experienced former [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] custodian [[Geoff Sidebottom]], Clemence later cited Sidebottom as a crucial early mentor: "I learned a lot from Geoff. He taught me how to look after myself because 'keepers were a lot less protected then."<ref>LFC Official Matchday Magazine interview. 30 October 2001. Liverpool vs Borussia Dortmund. Retrieved on 3 December 2020.</ref>

During his time at the club, Clemence lived with Mrs Ruby Duce of King Edward Street in [[Scunthorpe]]; in the very same digs which would then immediately be occupied by his future England and Liverpool teammate [[Kevin Keegan]] following Clemence's departure to Liverpool.<ref>Keegan, Kevin. (1977). ''Kevin Keegan by Kevin Keegan''. Arthur Baker Ltd, p54.</ref>

After being reintroduced to the side after they had lost their opening three games in all competitions,<ref name="nutstoiron"/> Clemence became Scunthorpe's undisputed first-choice goalkeeper in their following [[1966–67 Football League|1966–67]] [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] campaign,<ref name="nutstoiron"/> in which they finished a disappointing 18th.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.englishfootballleaguetables.co.uk/final/f1966-67.html#d3|title=1966-67 Season Final Football Tables|website=Englishfootballleaguetables.co.uk|access-date=14 November 2021}}</ref> After manager and ex-[[Busby Babes|Busby Babe]] [[Freddie Goodwin]] departed mid-season for the [[New York Generals]] in the nascent [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|North American Soccer League]], Clemence spent the latter half of his season under the guidance of caretaker player-manager [[Keith Burkinshaw]], who would later also sign the player for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].

And despite Clemence himself worrying that a humiliating 7–1 defeat away to arch-rivals [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] could end his professional career,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grimsby-townfc.co.uk/news/2020/november/ray-clemence/|title=▶️ Ray Clemence: '7-1 Defeat To Grimsby Town Almost Changed My Career'|website=Grimsby-townfc.co.uk|access-date=14 November 2021}}{{dead link|date=December 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Scunthorpe's faith in him never waivered and this defeat proved to be the second game in a run of 46 consecutive starts he made to see out all of Scunthorpe's remaining league and cup matches.<ref name="nutstoiron"/>

This run took Clemence's figures to 50 appearances and 12 clean sheets in all competitions for Scunthorpe;<ref name="bell2020"/> but unbeknownst to him, he had been scouted in 12 games by legendary Liverpool manager [[Bill Shankly]] and his coaching staff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/846|title=Ray Clemence - Liverpool's finest keeper - LFChistory - Stats galore for Liverpool FC!|website=Lfchistory.net|access-date=14 November 2021}}</ref> This came to fruition later that summer, when Clemence was forced to leave a beachside deckchair-stacking shift early, with the news that an urgent telegram awaited him at home.<ref name="bell2020"/> This was because Liverpool's bid for the now 18-year-old shot-stopper had been accepted, and the Scunthorpe chairman personally drove Clemence to Anfield in his Rolls-Royce the next morning.

Looking back on his time with the club, Clemence fondly recalled how Scunthorpe United was: "A club I'm proud to be associated with. While I was there, it was like being part of a family.<ref name="smp2020-11"/>

In 1971, Liverpool reached the [[1971 FA Cup final|FA Cup final]], where Clemence played well but [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] scored twice in extra time to overcome Liverpool's lead and win the game 2–1.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/observer/facup/story/0,8224,486514,00.html |title=Have a double on George |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |first=Hugh |last=McIlvanney |authorlink=Hugh McIlvanney |date=9 May 1971 |access-date=21 November 2020 }}</ref> There would be joy for Clemence two seasons later in 1973, when Liverpool won both the [[1972–73 in English football|League]] title and [[1972–73 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], with Clemence saving a penalty from [[Jupp Heynckes]] in the [[1973 UEFA Cup final|final]] of the latter against [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]]. The penalty save meant that Liverpool took a 3–0 lead for the second leg, rather than 3–1. Gladbach went on to win 2–0 in the second leg; had Heynckes scored the penalty, then the tie would have finished 3–3 on aggregate and Gladbach would have won on the away goals rule. The [[1973–74 Liverpool F.C. season|1973–74]] season saw Liverpool claim yet more silverware, winning the [[1974 FA Cup final|FA Cup]] with a comprehensive 3–0 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].

Liverpool won another League and UEFA Cup double in 1976 and then made a bid for a unique treble a year later. They achieved the first leg when they won the League title, but lost the [[1977 FA Cup final|FA Cup final]] 2–1 to rivals [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. A few days later, Liverpool won the [[1977 European Cup final|European Cup]] for the first time in Rome, defeating Borussia Mönchengladbach 3–1. In the second half, Clemence made a magnificent save against [[Uli Stielike]] when the score was 1–1.

Liverpool retained the European Cup in [[1978 European Cup final|1978]] with a narrow 1–0 win over [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]] at Wembley, but conceded their League title to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], to whom they also lost in the [[1978 Football League Cup final|League Cup final]]. In 1979 and 1980, Clemence kept goal as Liverpool clinched the League title in each season. The 1978–79 League success saw Clemence set a record that was never beaten under the two points for a win system, conceding only 16 goals in the 42 league matches (and just four at Anfield).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fl125.co.uk/records/league-goals|title=Goals: Fewest goals conceded in a season (in 42 games or more)|website=fl125.co.uk|access-date=4 January 2017}}</ref> This remarkable record remains for a 42-match season and endured until beaten in the 2004–05 season by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], who conceded 15 goals in the 38 League matches.

In 1981, Liverpool won the [[1981 Football League Cup final|League Cup]], and for the third time the [[1981 European Cup final|European Cup]], the latter with a 1–0 win over [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] in a dour contest at the [[Parc des Princes]] on 27 May. It turned out to be Clemence's last game for the club.

The emergence of [[Bruce Grobbelaar]] put Clemence's place in the side under threat for the first time in eleven years (during which period he played in more than 650 matches and missed a mere six), and he decided to leave Liverpool to join [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a fee of £300,000.

=== Tottenham Hotspur ===
Clemence left Liverpool to join [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in 1981 for a fee of £300,000.<ref>{{cite book |title=Tottenham Hotspur Player by Player |first=Ivan |last=Ponting |year=1993 |page=152 |publisher=Guinness |isbn=0851127177}}</ref> The two clubs reached the [[1982 Football League Cup final|1982 League Cup final]], which Liverpool won 3–1. Despite this, however, they won the [[1982 FA Cup final|1982 FA Cup]], defeating [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] 1–0 after a replay.

Clemence's first Tottenham appearance was in the [[1981 FA Charity Shield]] against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at Wembley on 22 August 1981, where [[Mark Falco]] and [[Peter Withe]] each scored twice in an entertaining 2–2 draw. His League debut came a week later with a winning start at [[Ayresome Park]], where they beat [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] 3–1. His first clean sheet came three games later on 12 September at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]], when he kept [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] off the scoresheet in the 1–0 victory.

Tottenham won the UEFA Cup in [[1984 UEFA Cup final|1984]]. Clemence missed the final against [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] through injury, but was on the bench as substitute goalkeeper in a match famously won when [[Tony Parks]] saved twice during the penalty shootout. Clemence reached a fifth FA Cup final in [[1987 FA Cup final|1987]], where his side lost to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. He is in a select group of players who have appeared in five or more FA Cup finals. He sustained an Achilles tendon injury in Tottenham's away match at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich]] in October 1987, which forced his retirement from playing in 1988. Shortly after retiring, Clemence joined the Tottenham coaching staff.

Throughout his career, he played over [[List of men's footballers with the most official appearances|1,100 career appearances]], remaining one of the very few players to have done so.<ref name=R1000/> According to the [[RSSSF]], he is the fifth player with the most official competitive appearances in world football, only behind [[Stanley Matthews]], [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Fábio (footballer, born 1980)|Fábio]], and [[Peter Shilton]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rsssf.org/players/duizend.html |title=Thousand Matches |publisher=[[RSSSF]] |date=23 January 2025 |access-date=24 June 2025}}</ref>

== International career ==
Clemence was a regular for [[England national football team|England]] between 1972 and 1983, making his debut and keeping his first clean-sheet in the 1–0 [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 5|World Cup qualifier]] win over [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at [[Ninian Park]] on 15 November 1972.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mason |first1=Peter |title=Ray Clemence obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/16/ray-clemence-obituary |website=The Guardian |date=16 November 2020 |publisher=Guardian News & Media Limited |access-date=16 November 2020}}</ref> England failed to qualify for [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s in 1974 and 1978. Clemence was part of the squad that qualified for [[UEFA Euro 1980]] but the team failed to qualify from Group 2. In 1982, he was in the squad for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], but again England did not progress beyond the quarter-final stage.

Clemence [[List of England national football team captains|captained]] England once — the first keeper to do so since [[Frank Swift]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Former England, Liverpool goalkeeper Clemence dies at 72 |url=https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/37608743/former-england-liverpool-goalkeeper-clemence-dies-72 |website=espn.com |date=15 November 2020 |publisher=ESPN Enterprises |access-date=15 November 2020}}</ref> The game in question was a 1981 friendly with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at Wembley, although Clemence couldn't prevent the Brazilians from scoring as England lost 1–0.

Because of injury to his left knee, Clemence was retired from international football with 61 England caps in a 12-year international career. The presence of another goalkeeper, [[Peter Shilton]], meant that the England management struggled to decide which keeper was the best, and ended up alternating their selection. Shilton ended up as first-choice keeper for the rest of the 1980s, playing in two more World Cups and attaining a record 125 caps.<ref>{{cite web |title=WHEN PETER SHILTON SET ENGLAND RECORD AGAINST DENMARK |url=https://www.thefa.com/news/2014/feb/02/peter-shilton-reaches-caps-record |website=TheFA.com |publisher=The FA}}</ref>

== Coaching career ==
=== Management ===
Clemence retired in 1988 and joined the coaching staff at Tottenham, working his way through to the first team, before leaving to become joint manager of [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] (with fellow goalkeeper [[Gary Phillips (English footballer)|Gary Phillips]]) in January 1994. At the start of the 1994–95 season, he took sole charge leading Barnet to ninth and 13th in the Third Division.

=== England coaching team ===
In August 1996,<ref name="FA"/> he was recruited by his former Spurs and England teammate [[Glenn Hoddle]] as goalkeeping coach for the [[England national football team|England national team]], a position he continued to hold under Hoddle's successors [[Kevin Keegan]] and [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]]. He remained in that position under [[Steve McClaren]], until he was replaced by Italian [[Franco Tancredi]] as goalkeeping coach in December 2007, as [[Fabio Capello]] took charge of the national team. Clemence, however, remained part of the England backroom staff, and when [[Roy Hodgson]] took over as manager, he reinstated Clemence as goalkeeper coach. On 11 June 2012, he snapped his Achilles tendon during England's warmups for their game against [[France national football team|France]] during [[UEFA Euro 2012]]. He was also England's Head of international teams, managing all the junior, women's and disability teams.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wallace |first1=Sam |title=From bootlaces to back rubs...meet the team behind the England team |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/from-bootlaces-to-back-rubs-meet-the-team-behind-the-england-team-1979813.html |website=The Independent |publisher=Independent Digital News and Media Limited |access-date=17 February 2024 |date=22 May 2010}}</ref> 

In 2013, Clemence retired; being "lavishly saluted", and being bought a gift from the England team; despite his last appearance at an international level being 30 years earlier.<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/10419213/Ray-Clemence-retires-after-47-years-in-a-game-he-graced-as-a-world-renowned-goalkeeper-and-top-class-coach.html | title=Stalwart Clemence quits after 47 years | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=1 November 2013 | access-date=4 November 2013 | first=Henry |last=Winter |authorlink=Henry Winter | pages=S8}}</ref> 

== Personal life and death ==
Clemence was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in the [[1987 Birthday Honours]] for services to football.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=50948 |date=12 June 1987 |page=11 |supp=y }}</ref> His son, [[Stephen Clemence|Stephen]] was a midfield player who came through the ranks at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], before retiring due to injury at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 2010. He was appointed manager of [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in 2023, then [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]] in 2024. Clemence's daughter Sarah also has footballing connections, being the wife of former [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] manager and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] striker [[Dougie Freedman]]. He also occasionally worked as a pundit on TV and radio, and commented on current goalkeeping stories in football.<ref name="Express">{{cite web | url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/440544/Pellegrini-coy-on-Hart-involvement | title=Pellegrini coy on Hart involvement | work=The Express | date=1 November 2013 | access-date=4 November 2013}}</ref><ref name="Al Jazeera">{{cite web | url=https://gulfnews.com/sport/football/al-jazeera-recruit-25-pundits-for-new-season-1.1216278 | title=Al Jazeera recruit 25 pundits for new season | work=gulfnews.com | date=3 August 2013 | access-date=4 November 2013 | first=Charles |last=Sale}}</ref>

In February 2005, Clemence announced that he had been diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] and that he would spend time away from the England squad whilst he received treatment. He was the second member of Eriksson's staff to be diagnosed with prostate cancer; [[Brian Kidd]] was diagnosed with the disease prior to [[UEFA Euro 2004]].
