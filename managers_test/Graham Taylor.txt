'''Graham Taylor''' (15 September 1944 – 12 January 2017) was an English [[association football|football]] player, [[manager (association football)|manager]], pundit and chairman of [[Watford F.C.|Watford Football Club]]. He was the manager of the [[England national football team]] from 1990 to 1993, and also managed [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].

He became a professional player, playing at full back for [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] and Lincoln City. After retiring as a result of injury in 1972, Taylor became a manager and coach. He won the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] title with Lincoln in 1976, before moving to Watford in 1977. He took Watford from the Fourth Division to the [[Football League First Division|First]] in five years. Under Taylor, Watford were First Division runners-up in [[1982–83 in English football|1982–83]], and FA Cup finalists in 1984. Taylor took over at Aston Villa in 1987, leading the club to promotion in 1988 and 2nd place in the First Division in [[1989–90 in English football|1989–90]].

In July 1990, he became the manager of the England team. They qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 1992|1992 European Championship]] but were knocked out in the group stages. Taylor resigned in November 1993, after the team failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] in the United States. Taylor faced heavy criticism from fans and media during his tenure as England manager and earned additional public interest and scrutiny when a television documentary, ''[[An Impossible Job]]'', which he had permitted to film the failed campaign from behind the scenes, aired in 1994.
 
Taylor returned to club management in March 1994 with Wolverhampton Wanderers. After one season at Molineux, he returned to Watford and led the club to the [[Premier League]] in 1999 after back-to-back promotions. His last managerial role was manager of Aston Villa, to which he returned in 2002. He left at the end of the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03 season]]. Taylor served as Watford's chairman from 2009 until 2012, after which he held the position of honorary life-president. He also worked as a pundit for [[BBC Radio 5 Live]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Worksop]], [[Nottinghamshire]],<ref name = BBC38596836/> Taylor moved in 1947 to a [[council house]] in Scunthorpe, where his father, Tom, was the sports reporter for the ''[[Scunthorpe Telegraph|Scunthorpe Evening Telegraph]]''. He went to the Henderson Avenue Junior School, then [[Scunthorpe Grammar School]] (now The St Lawrence Academy), where he met his future wife, Rita, from [[Winteringham]]. He played for the England Grammar Schools football team, and joined the sixth form after passing six [[O-levels]] in 1961, but he left after one year to pursue a full-time career in football. His head teacher disapproved of his actions and told him: "Grammar school boys don't become footballers".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/mr-warburton-graham-taylor|title=Ex-England football manager Graham Taylor on his best teacher: Mr Warburton|access-date=12 January 2017|date=11 June 2016|publisher=TES|archive-date=13 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113162209/https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/mr-warburton-graham-taylor|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Playing career==
His playing career began with as an apprentice for [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]].<ref>{{cite news|title = Profile: Graham Taylor – The turnip strikes back|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/profile-graham-taylor-the-turnip-strikes-back-1111071.html|work = The Independent|access-date = 2 December 2015|language = en-GB|archive-date = 17 November 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117223704/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/profile-graham-taylor-the-turnip-strikes-back-1111071.html|url-status = live}}</ref> He then went on to join [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in 1962 and played his first competitive game for them in September 1963 against Newcastle United when they won 2–1. He played 189 games at fullback for Grimsby Town, scoring twice. He was transferred to [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] in the summer of 1968 for a fee of £4,000, scoring once in 150 appearances before being forced to retire from playing following a serious hip injury in 1972.

==Club managerial career==
===Records===
Taylor was the only manager to have twice led teams that amassed over 70 points in one [[English Football League|Football League]] season under the League's original scoring system of two points for a win and one point for a draw. This system was introduced for the inaugural 1888–89 season and was retained for over 90 years until the reward for a win was increased to three points in 1981. He achieved this with Lincoln City (74 points – 1976) and Watford (71 points – 1978).<ref name=eflobit>{{cite web|url=http://www.efl.com/news/article/2016/graham-taylor-obe-1944-2017-3515463.aspx|title=Graham Taylor OBE: 1944–2017|access-date=12 January 2017|date=12 January 2017|publisher=EFL|archive-date=13 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113164945/http://www.efl.com/news/article/2016/graham-taylor-obe-1944-2017-3515463.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref> Only two other clubs, Doncaster Rovers (72 points – 1947) and Rotherham United (71 points – 1951), managed to gain over 70 points in one season under the original scoring system.

===Lincoln City (1972–1977)===
Taylor was the youngest person to become an [[the Football Association|FA]] coach, at the age of 27.<ref name=taylorobit>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38599231|title=Graham Taylor: Former England manager dies at the age of 72|date=12 January 2017|access-date=12 January 2017|work=BBC Sport|archive-date=12 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112135427/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38599231|url-status=live}}</ref> Following his retirement from playing, and a spell as player coach, Taylor became manager of [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], being the youngest manager in the league at the age of 28, on 7 December 1972 after [[David Herd (footballer)|David Herd]] resigned.<ref>{{Cite news |date=8 December 1972 |title=Taylor takes over from Herd as Lincoln's manager |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-guardian-journal-taylor-takes-over-f/177464327/ |access-date=26 July 2025 |newspaper=The Guardian Journal |page=14 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> In his first season Lincoln finished 10th, then 12th in 1974, but the following season narrowly missed out on promotion after a 3–2 defeat at [[Southport]] on 28 April 1975.<ref name="ReferenceA">Graham Taylor - in his own words (2017).</ref>

===Watford (1977–1987)===
In June 1977, Taylor was hired to manage [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] by new owner [[Elton John]]. He turned down an approach from First Division [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in favour of the [[Hertfordshire]]-based club, then competing in the Fourth Division, surprising pundits and supporters alike. John acted on the advice of [[Don Revie]] when hiring Taylor.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jul/02/1|title=First & last: Graham Taylor|date=1 July 2006|work=The Guardian|access-date=21 September 2016|archive-date=27 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927214224/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jul/02/1|url-status=live}}</ref>

Taylor's third season, in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], was less successful. Indicating the tougher competition, Watford managed only an 18th finish, out of 22 teams, avoiding relegation by eight points and winning only 12 of their 42 games in the [[1979–80 in English football|1979–80]] season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/division-two-old/1979-1980/table|title=English Division Two (old) 1979–1980|publisher=Statto.com|access-date=12 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113152838/http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/division-two-old/1979-1980/table|archive-date=13 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the next season, the [[1980–81 in English football|1980–81]] season, Taylor improved Watford's performance, ending it with 16 wins and a 9th-place finish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/division-two-old/1980-1981/table|title=English Division Two (old) 1980–1981|publisher=Statto.com|access-date=12 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113151017/http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/division-two-old/1980-1981/table|archive-date=13 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the [[1981–82 in English football|1981–82]] season Watford achieved promotion, ending the season in 2nd place, and gaining 23 wins and 11 draws in 42 games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/division-two-old/1981-1982/table|title=English Division Two (old) 1981–1982|publisher=Statto.com|access-date=12 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409202551/http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/division-two-old/1981-1982/table|archive-date=9 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In the First Division with Taylor as manager, Watford gained its highest-ever victory (8–0 against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]])<ref name=eflobit/> as well as the "double" over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], an away win at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and home victories over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]; this resulted in Watford finishing runners-up in the entire Football League.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/watford/1982-1983|title=Watford 1982–1983|publisher=Statto.com|access-date=12 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113152438/http://www.statto.com/football/teams/watford/1982-1983|archive-date=13 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He then took the side to the third round of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], having finished second in [[1982–83 in English football|1982–83]] (the club's first season as a top division club).

Taylor managed to take Aston Villa back to the top flight with his first attempt, securing their top flight safety in [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]] with a draw on the final day of the league season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/aston-villa/1988-1989|title=Aston Villa 1988–1989|publisher=Statto.com|access-date=12 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113151656/http://www.statto.com/football/teams/aston-villa/1988-1989|archive-date=13 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> During his third season at the club Villa finished runners-up in the First Division, having led the league table at several stages of the season before being overhauled in the final weeks by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/aston-villa/1989-1990|title=Aston Villa 1989–1990|publisher=Statto.com|access-date=12 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063236/http://www.statto.com/football/teams/aston-villa/1989-1990|archive-date=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Following this success, Taylor accepted an offer to take over the [[England national football team]] from [[Bobby Robson]], who left the job after England's semi-final defeat to [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]].<ref name=guardianobit>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/12/graham-taylor-dies-72-england-aston-villa-watford|title=Graham Taylor, former England manager, dies at the age of 72|access-date=12 January 2017|date=12 January 2017|work=The Guardian|archive-date=12 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112142550/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/12/graham-taylor-dies-72-england-aston-villa-watford|url-status=live}}</ref>

==International management: England (1990–1993)==
===Appointment===
When Taylor was appointed, critics in the media complained that he had never won a major trophy – although he had taken teams to second place in the league twice and an [[FA Cup final]] once in [[1984 FA Cup final|1984]]. It was also pointed out that Taylor had never played in "top-flight" football, let alone international level and that winning the respect of the players might be difficult. His critics also noted although he had ditched the long-ball game at Aston Villa, there were still tactical worries about his intentions, given that English clubs were looking to dispense with "route one" football in favour of a more "picturesque route to goal".<ref>Edworthy, pp. 14–147</ref>

===1992 European Championship===
Despite the unease at his appointment, England lost just once in Taylor's first 23 matches (a 1–0 defeat to [[Germany national football team|Germany]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in September 1991).<ref>Edworthy, p. 148</ref> However, England struggled to qualify for [[1992 European Football Championship|Euro '92]]. In a group containing [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]], and [[Poland national football team|Poland]], England were held to two 1–1 draws by Ireland and managed just 1–0 wins home and away against Turkey. It was only a late goal from [[Gary Lineker]] against Poland that saw England qualify at Ireland's expense. England's qualification for the Euro 92 finals proved to be the high point of Taylor's tenure.<ref>Edworthy 1997, p. 148.</ref>

The number of players that Taylor was using in the run up to the championship was also questioned, the press and public viewed this as evidence Taylor did not know his best team. He used 59 players in total, as he struggled to find a "new spine" after the retirement of [[Peter Shilton]], [[Terry Butcher]] and [[Bryan Robson]].<ref>Edworthy 1997, p. 156.</ref> He also faced accusations he could not cope with "stars", after he dropped [[Paul Gascoigne]] for [[Gordon Cowans]] for a qualifying game against Ireland.<ref>Edworthy 1997, p. 149.</ref> fearing he might "lose his head" in what would be a "bruising" encounter.<ref>Edworthy 1997, p. 1150.</ref> Matters were not helped by Taylor's reluctance to use creative players who were not perceived to have high work rates, such as [[Chris Waddle]] and [[Peter Beardsley]]. He also suffered several injuries, notably to [[Gary Stevens (footballer, born 1963)|Gary Stevens]], Lee Dixon, John Barnes and Paul Gascoigne, leaving the squad in a makeshift position going into the finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://backpagefootball.com/graham-taylor-and-the-impossible-job/34811/|title=Graham Taylor and the impossible job|publisher=BackPageFootball|first=Ciaran|last=Kelly|access-date=12 January 2017|date=6 March 2012|archive-date=13 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113163518/http://backpagefootball.com/graham-taylor-and-the-impossible-job/34811/|url-status=live}}</ref>

England were drawn to face [[France national football team|France]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and hosts [[Sweden men's national football team|Sweden]] in [[UEFA Euro 1992 Group 1|group 1]]. In the opening game against Denmark, England started brightly and missed several chances to take a lead. [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]] was guilty of a particularly glaring miss. Thereafter, Denmark began to dominate the match, and nearly won with minutes left as [[John Jensen]] struck a post. The game ended 0–0.<ref>Granville, Brian ''England's Managers: The Toughest Job in Football'' 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-7553-1651-9}} p. 176.</ref> In the match against France, Platt nearly scored with a diving header which went inches wide of the post, and [[Stuart Pearce]] hit the bar with a free-kick.

England needed to beat hosts [[Sweden men's national football team|Sweden]] to advance to the semi-finals. Lineker crossed for Platt to open the scoring on four minutes with a mishit volley. However, England wasted several chances to extend their lead. Platt made a pass to [[Tony Daley]] who wasted a chance to pass to Lineker in the open. England held a slender 1–0 lead at half-time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1990-00/1991-92/M0688Swe1992.html |title=England Match No. 688 - Sweden - 17 June 1992 - Match Summary and Report |website=Englandfootballonline.com |access-date=14 January 2017 |archive-date=4 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104234700/http://englandfootballonline.com/Seas1990-00/1991-92/M0688Swe1992.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Granville, Brian ''England's Managers: The Toughest Job in Football'' 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-7553-1651-9}} p. 177.</ref> After half-time, Sweden changed their personnel and formation, and dominated the second half, scoring twice to win 2–1 and eliminating England.<ref name="englandfootballonline1"/>

During the game, after 60 minutes and with the score at 1–1, Taylor substituted Gary Lineker in his final game for England, preventing Lineker from having the chance to equal, or possibly break, [[Bobby Charlton]]'s record of 49 goals for England. Many were dismayed to see Taylor substitute England's top striker when his side needed a goal. This led to the media's vilification of Taylor, including the "turnip" campaign by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', which began the morning after the game under the headline: "[[Rutabaga|Swedes]] 2 Turnips 1". During that campaign, the newspaper's back page featured an image of Taylor's face superimposed onto a [[turnip]].<ref>Edworthy, p. 149</ref>

===1994 World Cup Qualification===
====Stuttering start====
[[File:Graham Taylor Resigns Sun Headline.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' headline on 24 November 1993 following Taylor's resignation as England manager. Eighteen months earlier he had been called a "Turnip" by the newspaper, after England's defeat to [[Sweden men's national football team|Sweden]] in [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]]]]
Taylor's relationship with the press was partially restored when he admitted his mistakes a few weeks after the finals.<ref>Malam, pp. 120–121</ref> However, this did not last long. England's first game after Euro 92 ended in a 1–0 defeat to Spain in a friendly, ''The Sun'' depicted Taylor as a "Spanish onion".<ref name="Edworthy, p151">Edworthy, p. 151</ref>

England were drawn in Qualification [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA – Group 2)|Group 2]] for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] in the United States. The group contained [[Norway national football team|Norway]], the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]], [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] and [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]]. England were expected to qualify along with the Dutch.

England began with a disappointing 1–1 draw with Norway. Norway were the early pace setters, with victories over San Marino, the Netherlands and Turkey. Gascoigne returned, but the Norwegians were confident.<ref>{{cite news |author=Joe Lovejoy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-england-turn-to-gascoigne-for-dream-start-1557388.html |title=Football: England turn to Gascoigne for dream start |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date=14 January 2017 |archive-date=25 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625135302/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-england-turn-to-gascoigne-for-dream-start-1557388.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite dominating the game, England could muster only half-chances. Platt gave England the lead in the 55th minute after a cross from Stuart Pearce.

Norway rarely threatened, but equalised in the 77th minute, when [[Kjetil Rekdal]] scored from 20 yards. The draw flattered the Norwegians but put them clear in the group.

====Three wins and a Dutch draw====
The campaign seemed to get back on track with two wins against Turkey (4–0 at home and 2–0 away) and a 6–0 home victory over San Marino. During the latter game, Taylor confronted a spectator who was racially abusing Jamaica-born [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]], telling him "You're talking about another human being so just watch your language".<ref>{{cite news|title=Football mourns Graham Taylor: Farewell to a gentleman|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/01/12/graham-taylor-former-england-aston-villa-manager-dies-aged-72/|access-date=13 January 2017|work=Telegraph|date=12 January 2017|archive-date=12 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112212329/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/01/12/graham-taylor-former-england-aston-villa-manager-dies-aged-72/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In April 1993, England faced the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. England went 2–0 up in 24 minutes through [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] and [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]]. However, Taylor's luck had started to take a turn for the worse, as Paul Gascoigne was injured by [[Jan Wouters]]' elbow, but Wouters was not sent off.

[[Dennis Bergkamp]] scored a goal for the Netherlands towards the end of the first half, against the run of play, but England continued to control the game, and looked to be heading for a win which would have ended Dutch hopes of qualification, following the side's defeat in Norway, and a draw at home to Poland.

But four minutes from full-time [[Marc Overmars]] outpaced [[Des Walker]], prompting Walker to foul him inside the penalty area. The penalty was converted by [[Peter Van Vossen]] and the game ended 2–2. Suddenly England's "World Cup life" looked in danger.<ref name="Edworthy, p151"/>

====Draw in Poland, defeat in Norway====
England's next chance of reviving their flagging fortunes came in May, requiring at least a win and draw away against Poland and Norway which were to be played just three days apart. England were poor against Poland and were largely outplayed.<ref name="Edworthy, p152">Edworthy, p. 152</ref> [[Dariusz Adamczuk]] of Poland scored in the 36th minute, although the team missed several chances to extend their lead. [[Ian Wright]] salvaged a vital point through forcing an equaliser in the 85th minute, for a final score of 1–1.<ref name="Edworthy, p152"/> Taylor was again vilified for his team's poor performance. England's next opponents were Norway.

The Norwegians had arrived from obscurity and had taken the group by storm; their series of early victories had left England, Poland, and the Netherlands scrapping for second place.<ref name="Edworthy, p152"/> Taylor made wholesale changes of personnel and tactics, which again drew criticism, his actions considered risky in what was now a crucial game. [[Lee Sharpe]] and [[Lee Dixon]] came on as wing-backs, while [[Carlton Palmer]] and Platt occupied midfield berths. Gascoigne supported [[Teddy Sheringham]] and [[Les Ferdinand]] up-front. Des Walker, [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] and [[Gary Pallister]] formed a back three.<ref name="Edworthy, p152"/>

England lost 2–0, with few attempts on goal. [[Lars Bohinen]] and [[Øyvind Leonhardsen]] scored the goals in the 42nd and 47th minutes. The first was caused by a Des Walker error, while Walker was beaten for pace by a Norwegian counter-attack for Bohinen to score<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--world-cup-norway-destroy-taylors-england-calamity-in-oslo-as-a-revamped-team-collapses-in-the-face-of-scandinavian-skill-1489441.html| location=London| work=The Independent| first=Joe| last=Lovejoy| title=Norway destroy Taylor's England: Calamity in Oslo as a revamped team collapses in the face of Scandinavian skill| date=3 June 1993| access-date=29 August 2017| archive-date=25 September 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925203703/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--world-cup-norway-destroy-taylors-england-calamity-in-oslo-as-a-revamped-team-collapses-in-the-face-of-scandinavian-skill-1489441.html| url-status=live}}</ref> Subsequently, Taylor said: "We made a complete mess of it. I'm here to be shot at and take the rap. I have no defence for our performance",<ref name="Edworthy, p153">Edworthy, p. 153</ref> although his honesty did not spare him a roasting from the press, who were now calling for his head.<ref name="Edworthy, p153"/> The press came up with headlines such as "NORSE MANURE" and "OSLO RANS".<ref>''Do I Not Like That -The Final Chapter''</ref>

In July 1993, Peter Newman, an independent candidate in a [[1993 Christchurch by-election|parliamentary by-election]] for [[Christchurch (UK Parliament constituency)|Christchurch]], stood under the banner "Sack Graham Taylor".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/profile-graham-taylor--the-turnip-strikes-back-1111071.html|title=Profile: Graham Taylor – The turnip strikes back|date=7 August 1999|work=The Independent|access-date=29 August 2017|archive-date=25 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925005939/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/profile-graham-taylor--the-turnip-strikes-back-1111071.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

====The US Cup====
With their World Cup hopes hanging by a thread, Taylor's England were to play a four-team Tournament in the U.S ([[1993 U.S. Cup]]), which was expected to be a precursor to the following summer's tournament. Taylor stated before the game against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]:<blockquote>In football, you're only as good as your last game, and at the moment we're poor. You can always lose any game, to anyone. It's how you lose that matters.

That was the thing that shocked us all in Norway. We would have been looking for a win here anyhow, but if we'd won last week, it wouldn't have been considered essential. Now it is. Whether we like it or not, people expect us to beat America, and there is definitely more intensity about this game because of our performance in the last one.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-batty-given-the-safetypin-role-for-beltandbraces-england-walker-and-sheringham-dropped-in-wake-of-norway-humiliation-as-us-cup-opener-against-united-states-becomes-of-vital-importance-to-taylors-tenure-1490608.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Football: Batty given the safety-pin role for belt-and-braces England: Walker and Sheringham dropped in wake of Norway humiliation as US Cup opener against United States becomes of vital importance to Taylor's tenure | first=Joe | last=Lovejoy | date=9 June 1993 | access-date=4 May 2010 | archive-date=5 November 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105072157/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-batty-given-the-safetypin-role-for-beltandbraces-england-walker-and-sheringham-dropped-in-wake-of-norway-humiliation-as-us-cup-opener-against-united-states-becomes-of-vital-importance-to-taylors-tenure-1490608.html | url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>

For Taylor, the US Cup began with a humiliating 2–0 defeat in [[Boston]], to the United States with [[Thomas Dooley]] and [[Alexi Lalas]] scoring goals, which was reported by ''The Sun'' as "YANKS 2 PLANKS 0!".<ref>{{cite news |author=Trevor Haylett |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-the-painful-failure-of-a-proud-man-trevor-haylett-on-the-highs-and-lows-in-graham-taylors-career-1506464.html |title=Football: The painful failure of a proud man: Trevor Haylett on the highs and lows in Graham Taylor's career |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=24 November 1993 |access-date=14 January 2017 |archive-date=12 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112022448/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-the-painful-failure-of-a-proud-man-trevor-haylett-on-the-highs-and-lows-in-graham-taylors-career-1506464.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-englands-new-low-as-us-pile-on-the-misery-dooley-and-lalas-add-a-further-chapter-to-taylors-tale-of-woe-as-the-americans-go-one-better-than-their-forebears-in-belo-horizonte-1490806.html|title=England's new low as US pile on the misery|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=23 June 2010|date=10 June 1993|author=Joe Lovejoy|archive-date=6 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606084733/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-englands-new-low-as-us-pile-on-the-misery-dooley-and-lalas-add-a-further-chapter-to-taylors-tale-of-woe-as-the-americans-go-one-better-than-their-forebears-in-belo-horizonte-1490806.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Some pride was restored with a credible 1–1 draw with Brazil, and a narrow 2–1 defeat to Germany. Taylor was now living on borrowed time.<ref name="Edworthy, p154"/>

====Crucial match against the Netherlands====
The [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94 season]] began with a much-improved performance, with a 3–0 win over Poland raising the nation's hopes going into what was now the crucial match against the Netherlands in [[Rotterdam]].<ref name="Edworthy, p154">Edworthy, p. 154</ref>

In October, England were to play the Netherlands in Rotterdam. With Norway having won the group, the encounter would effectively decide the second and last qualifier of the group. The game was played at a furious pace, with the Netherlands putting England under pressure early on. However, England hit back with a string of counterattacks, with Platt heading just wide and [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] having a shot cleared off the line by [[Erwin Koeman]], while [[Tony Dorigo]] hit a post with a deflected 35-yard free-kick after 25 minutes.<ref name="Edworthy, p154"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/incoming/article109937.ece/BINARY/Holland+2-0+England |title=Football: News, opinion, previews, results & live scores – Mirror Online |website=Mirrorfootball.co.uk |access-date=14 January 2017 |archive-date=13 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211213180917/https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Two minutes before half-time England were fortunate to have a [[Frank Rijkaard]] goal ruled out for offside, even though replays showed the goal was legitimate.<ref name="Edworthy, p154"/> Later in the second half, with the game scoreless, David Platt was fouled by [[Ronald Koeman]] as he approached the Dutch goal. The German referee failed to apply the rule of sending him off for a professional foul. The Dutch charged down Dorigo's free kick, although they were clearly encroaching.<ref>Glanville, Brian. ''England Managers: The Toughest Job in Football'', p. 185.</ref> Just minutes later, Koeman took a free kick outside England's penalty area. His first shot was blocked, but it was ordered to be retaken because of encroachment.<ref name="Edworthy, p154"/> Koeman scored at the second attempt.

[[Paul Merson]] hit a post with a free-kick moments later, before [[Dennis Bergkamp]] scored, despite using his arm to control the ball, for a 2–0 win.<ref name="Edworthy, p154"/> In the meantime, Taylor was in an apoplectic mood on the touchline, berating the officials and referee as the significance of the result sank in.<ref name="Edworthy, p154"/>

====San Marino and resignation====
England still had a chance to qualify, providing the Netherlands lost in Poland on the same night, with England winning by a seven-goal margin or more. As such, England were hoping they could run up a big score against part-time minnows San Marino. But after just 8.3 seconds of play [[Davide Gualtieri]], a computer salesman, scored the fastest ever World Cup goal after a defensive error from [[Stuart Pearce]]. England took another twenty minutes to find an equaliser and eventually won 7–1, but the Netherlands won in Poland 3–1 and so England failed to qualify. Even if the Netherlands had not beaten Poland, England's inferior goal difference would have still meant they had failed to qualify.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bevan|first1=Chris|title=Davide Gualtieri: The man from San Marino who shocked England|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/19900296|access-date=13 January 2017|work=BBC Sport|date=11 October 2012|archive-date=20 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120081527/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/19900296|url-status=live}}</ref>

Taylor resigned on 23 November 1993, six days after England's failure to qualify. He went "with great sadness", saying: "No one can gauge the depth of my personal disappointment at not qualifying for the World Cup. This is the appropriate course of action in the circumstances," he said. "If we didn't qualify, it was always my intention to offer my resignation."<ref>{{cite news |author=Joe Lovejoy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-howe-set-to-become-england-caretaker-taylor-accepts-the-inevitable-and-tenders-resignation-1506463.html |title=Football: Howe set to become England caretaker: Taylor accepts the inevitable and tenders resignation as FA considers its options with chief executive favouring two-tier administration |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date=14 January 2017 |archive-date=5 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705233556/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-howe-set-to-become-england-caretaker-taylor-accepts-the-inevitable-and-tenders-resignation-1506463.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Taylor had also agreed to be filmed during the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying campaign]] for ''[[Cutting Edge (Channel 4 TV series)|Cutting Edge]]'', a [[Channel 4]] [[fly on the wall|fly-on-the-wall]] documentary series, in which his portrayal further undermined his authority. This was during the film ''[[An Impossible Job]]''; Taylor was heard to use foul language, and what became his personal [[catchphrase]]: "Do I not like that", uttered just before England conceded a goal to Poland.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eurosport.co.uk/football/do-i-not-like-that-the-documentary-that-charted-graham-taylor-s-england-career_sto6010632/story.shtml |title=Do I not like that?

==Return to club management==
===Wolverhampton Wanderers (1994–1995)===
[[Sir Jack Hayward]] appointed Taylor as manager of [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in March 1994, replacing [[Graham Turner]]. Taylor had been a generally unpopular figure in English football since his unsuccessful reign as national coach, and few people seemed willing to forgive him for his first managerial failure – one that mattered most to so many people up and down the country. But the following season Taylor took the Midlands club to fourth in Division One to qualify for the playoffs – their highest league finish since their last top division season eleven years earlier – where they lost out to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. They also reached the quarter-finals of the [[FA Cup]] after a memorable replay penalty shootout victory over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], in which they were 3–0 down on penalties, only to win the shootout 4–3, in which [[Chris Bart-Williams]] had two penalties saved over the two matches.

Taylor spent heavily on players while at Wolves, paying large sums for the likes of [[Steve Froggatt]], [[Tony Daley]], [[Mark Atkins (footballer)|Mark Atkins]], [[John de Wolf]], [[Dean Richards (footballer)|Dean Richards]] and [[Don Goodman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewolvessite.co.uk/managers.htm |title=Wolves Managers from 1885 to Today |access-date=2011-09-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002192056/http://www.thewolvessite.co.uk/managers.htm |archive-date=2 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

However, the [[1994–95 in English football#First Division|1994–95 season]] proved to be his only full season at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]], as, after a poor start to the following campaign, winning just four of the first sixteen league games, he resigned on 13 November 1995 due to overwhelming supporter pressure. During his tenure, he attempted to perform a [[citizen's arrest]] on a fan who had spat at him, prompting calls for closer crowd controls in the English game.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--------------------------taits-prank-finishes-with-an-fa-charge-1617082.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Tait's 'prank' finishes with an FA charge | first=Nick | last=Duxbury | date=25 April 1995 | access-date=4 May 2010 | archive-date=22 January 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122120908/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--------------------------taits-prank-finishes-with-an-fa-charge-1617082.html | url-status=live }}</ref>

Taylor called his Wolves' departure his "lowest ebb" in football - greater than even his Lancaster Gate exit - because he felt he had "lost his standing" in the game of football.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wolves ghost eludes Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/oct/30/match.sport13 |access-date=8 September 2019 |agency=The Guardian |date=30 October 2000 |archive-date=1 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801061723/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/oct/30/match.sport13 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Return to Watford (1996–2001)===
In February 1996 [[Elton John]], who had recently bought Watford for a second time, appointed Taylor as General Manager at Vicarage Road. Just over a year later Taylor had appointed himself as the club's manager succeeding [[Kenny Jackett]], who was relegated to a coaching capacity at the club.
