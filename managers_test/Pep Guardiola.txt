Guardiola was a [[defensive midfielder]] who usually played in a [[deep-lying playmaker]]'s role. He spent the majority of his career with [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], forming a part of [[Johan Cruyff]]'s ''[[FC Barcelona#Dream Team|Dream Team]]'' that won the club's first [[European Cup]] in [[1992 European Cup final|1992]], and four successive [[List of Spanish football champions|Spanish league titles]] from 1991 to 1994. He captained the team from 1997 until his departure from Barcelona in 2001. Guardiola then had stints with [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]] and [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] in Italy, [[Al-Ahli (Doha)|Al-Ahli]] in Qatar and [[Dorados de Sinaloa|Dorados]] in Mexico. He was [[Cap (association football)|capped]] 47 times for the [[Spain national football team|Spanish national team]] and appeared at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], as well as at [[UEFA Euro 2000]]. He also played friendly matches for [[Catalonia national football team|Catalonia]]. 

After retiring as a player, Guardiola briefly managed [[FC Barcelona B|Barcelona B]] and won the [[Tercera División]] title before taking charge of the first team in 2008. In his [[2008–09 FC Barcelona season|first season]], Guardiola led Barcelona to the [[Treble (association football)|continental treble]] of La Liga, the [[Copa del Rey]] and the UEFA Champions League, becoming the youngest manager to win the latter competition. He was named the [[FIFA World Coach of the Year]] in 2011 after leading the club to another La Liga and Champions League [[Double (association football)#European double|double]] in the [[2010–11 FC Barcelona season|2010–11 season]]. Guardiola ended his four-year Barcelona stint in 2012 with 14 honours, [[List of FC Barcelona records and statistics#Managerial records|a club record]].

Guardiola joined [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in 2013 and won the Bundesliga in each of the three seasons, including two [[Double (association football)#Germany|domestic doubles]]. He left the club for Manchester City in 2016 and has since won six Premier League titles, including four successive wins from 2019 to 2024, marking the first time in the history of the English top flight that a team has done so. His first title in his [[2017–18 Manchester City F.C. season|second season]] in charge broke numerous domestic records as the team became the first to [[Premier League records and statistics#Points|attain 100 points in a single season]]. He also led City to a [[Treble (association football)#Domestic trebles|domestic treble]] in [[2018–19 Manchester City F.C. season|2018–19]]. Guardiola guided City to their first [[2021 UEFA Champions League final|Champions League final]] in [[2020–21 Manchester City F.C. season|2020–21]], and their first [[2023 UEFA Champions League final|Champions League title]] as part of his second continental treble in [[2022–23 Manchester City F.C. season|2022–23]]. He is the club's [[List of Manchester City F.C. managers|second-longest serving manager]].

==Club career==
===1988–2001: Barcelona===
Born in [[Santpedor]], Barcelona<!-- DO NOT LINK, see [[MOS:GEOLINK]] for further guidance -->, Catalonia<!-- DO NOT LINK, see [[MOS:GEOLINK]] for further guidance -->, Guardiola joined [[La Masia]] at age 13 from [[Club Gimnàstic de Manresa|Gimnàstic Manresa]] and rose through the ranks of Barcelona's youth academy for six years, making his debut in 1990 against [[Cádiz CF|Cádiz]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wallace |first=Sam |date=28 May 2021 |title=Pep Guardiola, the early years: The crying boy at La Masia who became the man we know today |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/05/28/pep-guardiola-early-years-boy-cried-la-masia-became-man-know/ |access-date=18 May 2022 |archive-date=18 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220518172642/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/05/28/pep-guardiola-early-years-boy-cried-la-masia-became-man-know/ |url-status=live }}</ref> As [[Phil Ball (writer)|Phil Ball]] writes in ''Morbo'', {{Blockquote|In his first week at the club, [[Johan Cruyff]] turned up unannounced at the [[Mini Estadi]], a venue just down the road from [[Camp Nou]] used by [[FC Barcelona B|Barcelona B]].

"Guardiola – good lad," came the reply. Cruyff ignored the comment and told Rexach to move him into the middle for the second half, to play as [[Defensive midfielder|pivot]]. It was a difficult position to adapt to and one not used by many teams in Spain at the time. Guardiola adjusted immediately, as Cruyff had suspected he would, and when he moved to the first-team in 1990, he became the pivot of the [[FC Barcelona#Dream Team|Dream Team]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Josep Guardiola – The Boy from Santpedor |url=http://www.spain-football.org/josep-guardiola.html |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110210922/http://www.spain-football.org/josep-guardiola.html |archive-date=10 January 2013 |access-date=16 January 2013 |website=Spain-football.org}}</ref>}}

Guardiola became a first-team regular in the [[1991–92 La Liga|1991–92 season]], and at only 20 years old was a key component of a side that won [[List of Spanish football champions|La Liga]] and the [[1991–92 European Cup|European Cup]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Classification First Division 1991–92 |url=https://www.bdfutbol.com/en/t/t1991-92.html |access-date=18 May 2022 |website=BDFutbol |archive-date=22 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322101520/https://www.bdfutbol.com/en/t/t1991-92.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The Italian magazine ''Guerin Sportivo'' heralded Guardiola as the finest player in the world under the age of 21.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Barcelona |url=https://www.1nil.com/copy-of-australia |access-date=18 May 2022 |website=1nil |archive-date=16 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220516182551/https://www.1nil.com/copy-of-australia |url-status=dead }}</ref> Cruyff's "Dream Team" went on to retain La Liga title in the [[1992–93 La Liga|1992–93]] and [[1993–94 La Liga|1993–94 seasons]]. The side again reached the [[1994 UEFA Champions League final]], but were beaten 4–0 by [[Fabio Capello]]'s [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] side in [[Athens]]. Cruyff left in 1996, with Barcelona finishing fourth in the [[1994–95 La Liga|1994–95 season]] and third in the [[1995–96 La Liga|1995–96 season]], but Guardiola retained his position at the centre of Barcelona's midfield.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

In the [[1996–97 FC Barcelona season|1996–97 season]], Barcelona, this time led by [[Bobby Robson]], won three cups: the [[1996–97 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]], the [[1996 Supercopa de España|Supercopa de España]], and the [[1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]]. In 1997, Guardiola was named as Barcelona [[Captain (association football)|captain]] under new manager [[Louis van Gaal]], but a calf muscle injury ruled Guardiola out of most of the [[1997–98 FC Barcelona season|1997–98 season]], in which Barcelona won a [[1997–98 La Liga|league]] and [[1997–98 Copa del Rey|cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]]. At the end of the season, Barcelona rejected offers from [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] and [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] (of around 300 million [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]]) for Guardiola. After prolonged and complicated contract talks, he signed a new contract with Barcelona that extended his stay until 2001.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Guardiola returned to action [[1998–99 FC Barcelona season|the following season]] and Barcelona once again won [[1998–99 La Liga|La Liga]]. On 8 June 1998, Guardiola underwent surgery to try to resolve his lingering calf injury, which had caused him to miss the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] for Spain. A largely disappointing [[1999–2000 FC Barcelona season|1999–2000 season]] again ended in surgery, with Guardiola missing the last three months of the season with a serious [[Sprained ankle|ankle injury]].

On 11 April 2001, Barcelona's captain announced his intention to leave the club after 17 years of service. He stated that it was a personal decision and, in part, a response to what he perceived as football heading in a new, more physical, direction. On 24 June 2001, Guardiola played his last match with Barcelona in the final game of the season against [[Celta de Vigo|Celta Vigo]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=22 June 2001 |title=Condenados a sufrir |url=http://hemeroteca-paginas.mundodeportivo.com/EMD03/PUB/2001/06/22/EMD20010622002MDP.pdf |access-date=16 January 2013 |newspaper=Mundo Deportivo |location=Barcelona |language=es |archive-date=30 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530140827/http://hemeroteca-paginas.mundodeportivo.com/EMD03/PUB/2001/06/22/EMD20010622002MDP.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref> Guardiola played 479 games in 12 seasons for the first team, winning 16 trophies. At the press conference after the Celta game, he said: "It's been a long journey. I'm happy, proud, happy with the way people treated me and I have made many friends. I cannot ask for more. I have had many years in the elite. I did not come to make history but to make my own history." A number of future Barcelona midfielders, including [[Xavi (footballer, born 1980)|Xavi]], [[Andrés Iniesta]] and [[Cesc Fàbregas]], have hailed Guardiola as their role model and hero.<ref>{{Cite web |date=15 April 2009 |title=Fabregas: I am like Xavi and Guardiola is my hero |url=http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/17890/Fabregas_I_am_like_Xavi_and_Guardiola_is_my_hero.aspx |access-date=16 January 2013 |website=Sport.co.uk |publisher=Digital Sports Group |archive-date=30 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330080127/http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/17890/Fabregas_I_am_like_Xavi_and_Guardiola_is_my_hero.aspx |url-status=live}}</ref>

===2001–2006: Later career===
After leaving Barcelona in 2001 at age 30, Guardiola joined [[Serie A]] side [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]] as [[Andrea Pirlo]]'s replacement in the [[deep-lying playmaker]] role, where he played alongside [[Roberto Baggio]] under manager [[Carlo Mazzone]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Storie di Provincia: le quattro stagioni del Brescia di Baggio e Mazzone (e non solo) |url=http://www.mondopallone.it/2013/07/18/storie-di-provincia-le-quattro-stagioni-del-brescia-di-baggio-e-mazzone-e-non-solo/ |access-date=20 October 2014 |archive-date=20 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020060539/http://www.mondopallone.it/2013/07/18/storie-di-provincia-le-quattro-stagioni-del-brescia-di-baggio-e-mazzone-e-non-solo/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> Following his stint at Brescia, Guardiola transferred to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. His time in Italy, however, was unsuccessful and included a four-month ban for testing positive for [[nandrolone]] (he was cleared of all charges in 2009).<ref>{{Cite news |date=30 September 2009 |title=Itàlia desestima el recurs de la Fiscalia Antidopatge contra Guardiola |newspaper=Avui |location=Barcelona |url=http://www.avui.cat/cat/notices/2009/09/italia_desestima_el_recurs_de_la_fiscalia_antidopatge_contra_guardiola_73218.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120723191911/http://www.avui.cat/cat/notices/2009/09/italia_desestima_el_recurs_de_la_fiscalia_antidopatge_contra_guardiola_73218.php |archive-date=23 July 2012 |access-date=16 January 2013 |language=ca}}</ref>

After his career with Brescia and Roma, in 2003, Guardiola played in Qatar with [[Al-Ahli (Doha)|Al-Ahli]] from [[Doha]] in the [[Qatar Stars League]]. In 2005–06, he turned down offers from a number of European clubs, as he felt his playing career was coming to a close.<ref>{{Cite news |date=20 August 2005 |title=No deal for Guardiola |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_city/s/170/170628_no_deal_for_guardiola.html |access-date=16 January 2013 |archive-date=24 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211024182814/https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2006, [[Juan Manuel Lillo]] was appointed the manager of Mexican club [[Dorados de Sinaloa|Dorados]]. Lillo recruited Guardiola to play for the club while he was in managing school in Axocopán, [[Atlixco]], [[Puebla]]. Guardiola played with Dorados for six months, but was limited to ten appearances due to injuries, before retiring. He scored one goal for the club.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Tucker |first=Duncan |date=30 July 2016 |title=How a six-month spell in Mexico set Pep Guardiola on road to coaching greatness |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/30/mexico-pep-guardiola-coaching-manchester-city |access-date=12 May 2019 |archive-date=12 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512155803/https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/30/mexico-pep-guardiola-coaching-manchester-city |url-status=live}}</ref>

Guardiola was a member of the Spanish team during the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], where they reached the quarter-finals, losing 2–1 to [[Italy national football team|Italy]].

====2008–09: First season with first team and historic treble====
[[File:PepGuardiola.jpg|thumb|right|Guardiola managing [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 2009]]

Upon being appointed, Guardiola made headlines by announcing that stars such as [[Ronaldinho]], [[Deco]] and [[Samuel Eto'o]] were not part of his plans for [[2008–09 La Liga|the coming season]],<ref>{{Cite news |last=Taylor |first=Daniel |date=18 June 2008 |title=Barcelona clear way for Deco, Ronaldinho and Eto'o to leave |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jun/18/laligafootball.barcelona |access-date=15 December 2020 |archive-date=26 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201126080014/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jun/18/laligafootball.barcelona |url-status=live}}</ref> though Eto'o was, in the end, allowed to remain.

The most important match, however, was on 2 May when they defeated Real Madrid [[El Clásico|6–2]] at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Santiago Bernabéu]]. The league title was the second piece of silverware in Guardiola's first season at the club. Earlier, on 13 May, Barcelona won the [[2008–09 Copa del Rey]], beating [[Athletic Bilbao]] 4–1 in the [[2009 Copa del Rey final]].{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

==Manager profile==
===Tactics===
Although much emphasis is placed on retaining possession of the ball and dictating play, with the intent to have the opposing side's defence chase the ball for extended periods of play, Guardiola's teams are recognised for [[Glossary of association football terms#P|pressing]] off the ball. Players press and harry the opposition collectively in an attempt to win back possession of the ball. This collective press is only conducted in the starting third of the opposition's pitch where less space exists and defenders and/or the goalkeeper may not be as good at dribbling or passing the ball as a midfielder.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

As high pressing became prominent, Guardiola sought to counteract it with [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] and [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] comfortable with controlling the ball and both long and short ball distribution, with goalkeepers such as [[Víctor Valdés|Victor Valdés]] and Manuel Neuer also acting as [[sweeper-keeper]]s at Barcelona and Bayern Munich, rushing off their line to prevent counter-attacks, and playing out from the back.

Considered by pundits to be one of the greatest managers of all time,<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> Guardiola is often linked with the successes of the Spanish and German national teams in {{decade|2010}}, both of whom had many first-team players that were coached by him.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The teams that Pep built: How Guardiola helped Spain and Germany win the World Cup |url=https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1956/europe/2014/11/18/6262521/the-teams-that-pep-built-how-guardiola-helped-spain-and |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602215915/https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1956/europe/2014/11/18/6262521/the-teams-that-pep-built-how-guardiola-helped-spain-and |date=18 November 2014 |archive-date=2 June 2021 |website=Goal |last1=Hayward |first1=Ben |first2=Falko |last2=Bloding |access-date=30 May 2021 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Jürgen Klopp]] credits Guardiola with building the toughest teams he has ever faced, stating: "I could say City are the toughest opponent I've ever had but it wasn't much easier when I faced Pep's Bayern [..] We push each other to insane levels."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2022/3/8/22965786/the-daily-hilario-tuesday-march-8 |title=The Daily Hilario: Tuesday |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220308083911/https://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2022/3/8/22965786/the-daily-hilario-tuesday-march-8 |archive-date=8 March 2022 |date=8 March 2022 |via=SB Nation |first=Shauryas |last=Sharma |access-date=8 March 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2017, Italian defender [[Giorgio Chiellini]] was critical of Guardiola's philosophy, however, and expressed his belief that the popularisation of possession-based playing styles, associated with Barcelona under Guardiola, and the increasing focus on developing defenders who are comfortable with the ball at their feet from a young age in Italy, had in fact had a negative impact on their overall defensive quality. He commented: "''Guardiolismo'' [a term he coined for "the Guardiola way"] has ruined a generation of Italian defenders a bit – now everyone is looking to push up, defenders know how to set the tone of play and they can spread the ball, but they don't know how to mark."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.as.com/en/2017/11/09/football/1510250032_810638.html |title=Chiellini: Guardiolismo has ruined a generation of defenders |last1=Calemme |first1=Mirko |work=AS.com |date=9 November 2017 |access-date=17 May 2020 |archive-date=24 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924090519/https://en.as.com/en/2017/11/09/football/1510250032_810638.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/italy/story/3264350/pep-guardiolas-tactics-have-ruined-italian-defenders-giorgio-chiellini |title=Pep Guardiola's tactics have 'ruined' Italian defenders - Giorgio Chiellini |publisher=ESPN FC |date=9 November 2017 |access-date=17 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/mondiali-2018/italia/2017/11/09-33618707/italia_chiellini_un_flop_con_la_svezia_sarebbe_unonta/ |title=Italia, l'allarme di Chiellini: "Il guardiolismo ha rovinato una generazione di difensori" |work=Il Corriere dello Sport |language=it |last1=Santoni |first1=Andrea |date=9 November 2017 |access-date=17 May 2020 }}</ref>
