Jokanović began his managerial career in 2007, winning two consecutive [[Double (association football)|doubles]] with Partizan, the [[2012 Thai Premier League]] with [[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]], and leading [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] to promotion to the [[Premier League]] in [[2014–15 Football League Championship|2015]] and [[2017–18 EFL Championship|2018]] respectively.

===Early career===
Born in [[Novi Sad]], [[Vojvodina]], SFR Yugoslavia,<ref name=Hugman/> Jokanović started playing with his hometown club [[FK Novi Sad|Novi Sad]], and made his senior debut with neighbouring [[FK Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], helping it win its second [[Yugoslav First League|national title]] in the [[1988–89 Yugoslav First League|1988–89 season]], with four goals in 24 matches.

In 1990, Jokanović joined [[Belgrade]]'s [[FK Partizan|Partizan]]. In [[1991–92 Yugoslav First League|his second year]] he helped the team [[1991–92 Yugoslav Cup|win]] the [[Yugoslav Cup|domestic cup]] and, in [[1992–93 First League of FR Yugoslavia|his third]], he scored 13 league goals (a career best), being one of several players to net in double digits – the team scored 103 in 36 matches – ''[[wikt:en route|en route]]'' to the league conquest.<ref name=RSSSF>{{cite web|url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablesj/joeg93.html|title=Yugoslavia 1992/93|website=[[RSSSF]]|access-date=7 October 2015}}</ref>

After his displays at Partizan, Jokanović signed for [[Real Oviedo|Oviedo]] in Spain. During his two-year spell, he partnered compatriots [[Janko Janković]], [[Nikola Jerkan]] and [[Robert Prosinečki]] and, subsequently, he joined fellow [[La Liga]] club [[CD Tenerife|Tenerife]] for the [[1995–96 CD Tenerife season|1995-96 season]], being instrumental in their domestic and [[UEFA|European]] consolidation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spherasports.com/que-fue-tenerife-semifinalista-uefa-116746/|title=¿Qué fue del CD Tenerife semifinalista de la UEFA?|trans-title=What happened to UEFA semi-finalists CD Tenerife?|publisher=Sphera Sports|language=es|date=18 January 2017|access-date=21 September 2017|archive-date=21 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921144142/http://www.spherasports.com/que-fue-tenerife-semifinalista-uefa-116746/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Deportivo de La Coruña===
In the summer 1999, Jokanović signed for [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]] at the insistence of coach [[Javier Irureta]], who deployed him in a partnership with Brazilians [[Donato Gama da Silva|Donato]] and [[Mauro Silva]]. The trio combined for 85 matches and five goals, as the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicians]] won [[1999–2000 La Liga|their first ever league title]].<ref name=Kaiser>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaisermagazine.com/cromo/jokanovic-oviedo-tenerife-espana/|title=Jokanovic, el motor serbio que triunfó en España|trans-title=Jokanovic, the serbian motor that made it big in Spain|publisher=Kaiser Magazine|language=es|date=1 January 2015|access-date=7 October 2015}}</ref>

===Chelsea===
After only one season with Deportivo, Jokanović signed with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in October 2000, for £1.7&nbsp;million. Under coach [[Claudio Ranieri]], he appeared 39 times for the Blues over two consecutive [[Premier League]] seasons, and played a total of 53 matches. He was released in July 2002, at nearly 34.<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/2119573.stm Jokanovic leaves Chelsea]; BBC Sport, 10 July 2002</ref>

He subsequently retired from professional football, after playing just three months in the Spanish second division with [[Ciudad de Murcia|Ciudad Murcia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2003/08/19/mas_futbol/1061244024_850215.html|title=Jokanovic: "Echaba de menos el fútbol"|trans-title=Jokanovic: "I missed football"|newspaper=[[Diario AS]]|last=Díez|first=Ignacio|location=Madrid|language=es|date=19 August 2003|access-date=7 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fichajes.net/noticias/jokanovic-rescindio-su-contrato-con-el-ciudad-de-murcia|title=Jokanovic rescindió su contrato con el Ciudad de Murcia|trans-title=Jokanovic terminated his contract with Ciudad de Murcia|publisher=Fichajes|language=es|date=21 December 2003|access-date=7 October 2015}}</ref>

==International career==
Jokanović played six times for [[Yugoslavia national football team|SFR Yugoslavia]], his debut coming on 27 February 1991 in a [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly]] with [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], when he played the last ten minutes after replacing [[Željko Petrović]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eu-football.info/_player.php?id=9690|title=Slaviša Jokanović, international football player|access-date=14 September 2024|website=EU-football.info}}</ref> He then appeared in some [[UEFA Euro 1992]] [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying|qualifying matches]], helping the national team to top its group; he was selected for the final tournament,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1992/05/27/pagina-27/1245648/pdf.html|title=Pancev también renuncia a la Eurocopa|trans-title=Pancev also passes on Eurocup|newspaper=[[Mundo Deportivo]]|last=Stankovic|first=Vladimir|language=es|date=25 May 1992|access-date=5 June 2019}}</ref> but the team would be suspended due to the [[Yugoslav Wars]].

During the last official game ever that SFR Yugoslavia played on the 28th of May 1992 against [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] in [[Florence]], Jokanovic scored the only goal for his team and subsequently became the last man to score a goal for [[Yugoslavia]]. Fiorentina made a comeback and won the game 2–1. The match was played just two days before the announcement of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757]] which forbade Yugoslavia to participate at UEFA Euro 1992.

In the former competition, he scored his first two international goals in an 8–1 away win over the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]] [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|in qualification]] before playing four complete matches as the national team reached the [[Single-elimination tournament|round-of-16]]; in the latter he appeared three times, being [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in a 3–4 loss, with the team reaching the quarter-finals.<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/yugoslavia/803466.stm Yugoslavia hit by fine]; BBC Sport, 23 June 2000</ref>

==Coaching career==

===Partizan===
Jokanović was living in [[Madrid]] when, in September 2007, he joined the technical staff of [[Tercera División]] club [[CA Pinto|Pinto]]. However, three months later, he became the head coach of Partizan, replacing [[Miroslav Đukić]], who left to take the reins of the national team. His family (wife and three children) remained in the Spanish capital.<ref name="PO ref">{{cite web |url=http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/sport/najnovije_vesti/story/49429/NISAM%2BNAVIJAO%2BZA%2BZVEZDU%2BU%2BBARIJU.html |author-last=Stanić | author-first=M. | agency=Press Online |title=Nisam navijao za Zvezdu u Bariju |access-date=2023-12-27 |date=2008-10-19 |language=sr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215064220/http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/sport/najnovije_vesti/story/49429/NISAM+NAVIJAO+ZA+ZVEZDU+U+BARIJU.html |archive-date=15 February 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In May 2008, under Jokanović's management, Partizan won [[Double (association football)|the double]] ([[Serbian SuperLiga|league]] and [[Serbian Cup|cup]]). He was also selected as the year's "Best Coach in Serbia" by the [[Football Association of Serbia]], but refused to receive this award due to Partizan's poor results in [[2008–09 UEFA Cup|the group stage]] of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]].<ref name=DOUBLE>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=srb/news/newsid=824381.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306013341/http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=srb/news/newsid=824381.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 March 2010|title=Partizan steamroll Serbia into submission|publisher=UEFA|last=Bošković|first=Aleksandar|date=27 April 2009|access-date=7 October 2015}}</ref>

Jokanović led Partizan to another double in [[2008–09 Serbian SuperLiga|his first full season]], winning the league by a margin of 19 points over former team Vojvodina. Thus, he became the first coach in the club's history to successfully defend the title; on 5 September 2009, however, he left the post by mutual consent, bidding farewell through an open letter.<ref>[https://archive.today/20090907005820/http://www.partizan.rs/vest.php?Jezik=sr&IDV=658&akcija=&prikaz1=2009&prikaz2=9&sec=2 Jokanović nije više trener Partizana!
