'''Paul Emerson Carlyle Ince''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|n|s}}; born 21 October 1967) is an English professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former player who was most recently manager of [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. A [[midfielder]], Ince played professionally from 1986 to 2007, starting his career with [[West Ham United]] and later representing [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] and [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] in England, as well as [[Inter Milan]] in Italy. With a combined total of 271 league appearances for the two, Ince is one of the few players, especially in the [[Premier League]] era, to have represented both of [[Liverpool F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry|arch rivals Liverpool and Manchester United]].

Ince spent the majority of his playing career at the highest level; after breaking through with his boyhood club West Ham United in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], he joined Manchester United in 1989, where he won the Premier League twice, the [[FA Cup]] twice and the [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] once during his six-year spell at [[Old Trafford]]. After falling out with manager [[Alex Ferguson]], Ince was sold to Inter Milan of [[Serie A]] in 1995, where he was a runner-up in the 1997 [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. After two years in Italy, Ince returned to the Premier League with Liverpool, later also representing Middlesbrough and Wolverhampton Wanderers in the top flight.

Ince was capped 53 times by the [[England national football team|England national team]], scoring two goals. He played at [[UEFA Euro 1996]], the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], and became the first black player to [[Captain (association football)|captain]] England.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1517672.stm 10 key moments in UK race relations].</ref> 

After a spell as player-coach of Swindon, he retired from playing while player-manager of Macclesfield Town in 2007. He went on to manage [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] (twice), [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] and [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]. His son [[Tom Ince|Tom]] is also a footballer.

==Club career==
===West Ham United===
Paul Emerson Carlyle Ince was born in [[Ilford]], Greater London.<ref name=blackmanager/> He grew up as a [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] supporter. He was spotted playing, aged 12, by West Ham manager [[John Lyall]] around the time that the club was in the Second Division and achieved a surprise FA Cup final triumph over Arsenal.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Ince signed for the Hammers as a trainee, aged 14. Lyall helped Ince through troubled school times eventually signing him as a [[Youth Training Scheme|YTS]] trainee, on leaving school, in 1984.<ref name="Belton">Belton, Brian (2006). ''The Black Hammers p.76'' Pennant Books. {{ISBN|0-9550394-5-2}}</ref> He is a product of the [[The Academy of Football|West Ham youth team]] and made his debut in English football on 30 November 1986 against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&ham=348&united=Paul_Ince|title=Paul Ince|website=www.westhamstats.info|access-date=10 March 2019}}</ref> He became a regular player in [[1987–88 in English football|1987–88]], proving himself to have all-round qualities of pace, stamina, uncompromising tackling and good passing ability. He also packed a powerful shot, and was awarded with England under-21 honours to go with the youth [[cap (football)|caps]] he acquired as an apprentice. He firmly established himself as the successor in West Ham's midfield for the veteran [[Billy Bonds]], who retired at the end of the 1987–88 season. Unfortunately for Ince, West Ham were not enjoying one of their best spells when he broke into the team. Despite having won the FA Cup in 1980 and finished third in the league in 1986, they had failed to sustain their challenge for major honours and finished 15th in 1987 and 16th in 1988, and worse was to follow.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

In August 1988, an eventful [[1988–89 in English football|season]] for Ince began. In a struggling West Ham side, he shot to national recognition with two stunning goals in a shock 4–1 win over defending league champions [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], and continued to score goals as the Hammers reached the semi-finals while having real trouble finding any form in the League. West Ham lost to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in the semi-finals and, despite frequent displays of individual brilliance from Ince, were relegated at the end of the season, which cost manager [[John Lyall]] his job after 15 years at the helm. 

===Manchester United===
[[File:Paul Ince juli 1991.JPG|right|thumb|Ince in 1991]]

Ince played just once in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] the following season before completing a highly controversial transfer to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for [[Pound sterling|£]]1&nbsp;million. Ince had been photographed in a Manchester United kit long before the transfer was complete, which appeared in the ''[[Daily Express]]''. Ince received abuse from West Ham United fans for many years afterwards. The initial move was postponed after he failed a medical, but was quickly completed on 14 September 1989 after he later received the all-clear.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-07-12|title=Paul Ince: The Rise and Fall of the Guv'nor|url=https://mufclatest.com/paul-ince-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-guvnor/|access-date=2021-06-30|website=MUFC Latest|language=en-GB|archive-date=9 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709181617/https://mufclatest.com/paul-ince-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-guvnor/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In an article in ''[[Four Four Two]]'' magazine,{{when|date=March 2019}} Ince said:

''"I spoke to [[Alex Ferguson]] and the deal was close to being done. I then went on holiday, and my agent at the time, [[Ambrose Mendy]], said it wasn't worth me coming back to do a picture in a United shirt when the deal was completed, so I should do one before I left, and it would be released when the deal was announced. Lawrence Luster of the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' took the picture and put in the library. Soon after, their sister paper, the ''Daily Express'', were looking for a picture of me playing for West Ham, and found the one of me in the United shirt in the pile. They published it and all hell broke loose. "I came back from holiday to discover West Ham fans were going mad. It wasn't really my fault. I was only a kid, I did what my agent told me to do, then took all the crap for it."''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/exclusive-edwards-knox-on-ince-west-ham-that-man-utd-shirt-snap-4205361|title=EXCLUSIVE: Edwards & Knox on Ince, West Ham & THAT Man Utd shirt snap - Tribal Football|website=www.tribalfootball.com|access-date=10 March 2019}}</ref>

Ince eventually made his Manchester United debut in a 5–1 win over [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], although his next game for United came in a 5–1 [[Manchester derby]] defeat by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Ince became a strong presence in the United midfield alongside [[Bryan Robson]] and [[Neil Webb]], although the first season of this midfield partnership saw Robson and in particular Webb miss many games due to injury.  

United won the [[FA Cup]] in his first season, defeating [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] 1–0 in a replay at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] after initially drawing 3–3. In both of these games, Ince was selected at right-back in favour of [[Viv Anderson]], with his favoured central midfield position being occupied by [[Mike Phelan]]. Ince was man of the match for the replay.<ref>[http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1990.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427172120/http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1990.htm|date=27 April 2012}}</ref>

Over the next four seasons, Robson's United career gradually wound down until he finally left to manage [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in 1994. During this time, Ince found himself playing alongside several other different central midfielders, including Mike Phelan, Neil Webb and [[Darren Ferguson]]. One of his best games came in February 1994, when he scored in a 2–2 away draw with former club West Ham in the [[Premier League]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=West Ham United v Manchester United, 26 February 1994|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/west-ham-united-v-manchester-united-26-february-1994-21568/|access-date=2021-06-30|website=11v11.com}}</ref>

Ince won his second winners' medal when Manchester United defeated [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the final of the [[Cup Winners Cup|European Cup Winners Cup]] in [[Rotterdam]] in 1991, and received his third another year later when United beat [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in the 1992 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Manchester United continued to dominate the domestic game in 1993–94, enjoying an almost unbroken lead of the Premier League throughout the season, and Ince was the midfield general in the side which won the "double" of league and FA Cup in 1994. A year later Manchester United went to West Ham on the last day of the season, needing a win to retain their Premier League crown. They could only draw the game and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] took the title. Ince's next game saw them lose the FA Cup final to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], leaving United without a major trophy for the first time in six seasons. 

In June 1995, Ferguson sold Ince to [[Inter Milan]] for £7.5&nbsp;million – at the time one of the biggest fees involving an English club. Ferguson had long sustained a tempestuous relationship with Ince, labelling him a "bottler" and a "big-time Charlie" (a statement Ferguson said later he regretted). Ince's nickname, ''The Guvnor'', also rankled with Ferguson, who once berated him by saying, "There's only one guvnor around here, Incey, and it ain't you".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://talksport.com/football/484110/manchester-united-paul-ince-alex-ferguson-big-time-charlie-liverpool/ |title= Paul Ince recalls argument with angry Sir Alex Ferguson, who later called him 'big time Charlie' ahead of Liverpool vs Man United|date= 16 January 2020}}</ref> Many fans saw this as the prime reason for Ince being sold, rather than on footballing or economic grounds.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2008/06/25/sfnbla125.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628134420/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2008/06/25/sfnbla125.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 June 2008 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Blackburn's Paul Ince enjoys return to big time |first=Neil |last=Johnston |date=25 June 2008 |access-date=22 May 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hunter |first=Andy |title=Ferguson: my regrets over Ince feud |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/04/premierleague.blackburn |access-date=18 October 2015 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=4 October 2008}}</ref>

While at United, Ince won two [[Premier League]] title medals as well as two [[FA Cup]] winner's medals and one winner's medal each in the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] and [[Football League Cup]]. He had also collected runners-up medals in the League Cup twice and the FA Cup once.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

===Inter Milan===
In the 1995–96 season, Inter failed to challenge for a 14th [[scudetto]], finishing seventh in Serie A. Ince, though, had a successful first season, playing in all but four of Inter's league matches and performing well after a slow start which had started speculation that he could be on his way back to the Premier League as early as the November transfer window - with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] both reported to be interested. However, he would remain in Milan for two seasons.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/that-was-the-season-that-was-1345862.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220525/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/that-was-the-season-that-was-1345862.html |archive-date=25 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=That was the season that was|date=6 May 1996|website=The Independent|access-date=10 March 2019}}</ref>

The next year, Ince had another successful season with the nerazzurri, scoring 6 times in 24 matches in the championship – in which Inter finished third – and also playing his part in Inter's run through to the [[UEFA Cup]] Final. Ince scored in the third round second-leg match away to [[Boavista F.C.|Boavista]] as Inter swept all before them before meeting [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] in [[1997 UEFA Cup Final|the final]]. Ince was suspended for the away first-leg as Inter lost 1–0<ref>{{cite news

Ince was offered a new, improved contract by club president [[Massimo Moratti]], despite having two and a half years left on his current contract. Due to family reasons he was unable to accept the contract and returned to England with Liverpool.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

===Liverpool===
In July 1997, Ince returned to England, joining Manchester United's rivals [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. His new club's fans were divided over his links to United.<ref name=belfast>{{cite news |title=On This Day in 1997: Former Man Utd midfielder Paul Ince signs for Liverpool |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/on-this-day-in-1997-former-man-utd-midfielder-paul-ince-signs-for-liverpool-39377976.html |access-date=20 February 2022 |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=17 July 2020}}</ref> In his first season at [[Anfield]], he equalised in a 1–1 [[Merseyside Derby]] draw at home to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 23 February 1998,<ref>{{cite news |title=Honours shared in Merseyside derby |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/59484.stm |access-date=20 February 2022 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 February 1998}}</ref> and on 6 May he scored twice in a 4–0 win over newly crowned league champions Arsenal to secure third place.<ref>{{cite news |title=Liverpool blitz new champions; Liverpool 4 Arsenal 0. |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Liverpool+blitz+new+champions%3B+Liverpool+4+Arsenal+0.-a060777976 |access-date=20 February 2022 |work=The Birmingham Post |date=7 May 1998}}</ref> He equalised in a 2–2 comeback draw against United, who nonetheless [[1998–99 Manchester United F.C. season|won the treble]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Old-boy Ince robs United |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/336523.stm |access-date=20 February 2022 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 May 1999}}</ref>

According to [[Graeme Le Saux]]'s autobiography, Ince's homophobic taunting and Le Saux's reaction during a 1997 match between Liverpool and Chelsea resulted in a long-running coolness between the two players.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article2419068.ece |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524024131/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article2419068.ece |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 May 2011 |work=The Times |location=London |title=How gay slurs almost wrecked my career |date=10 September 2007 |access-date=22 May 2010 }}</ref> Ince won no honours in his two seasons with Liverpool, and remarked on his teammates "I just felt they were good players, but just wanted to go out all the time, and I just thought that wasn't the way.

Houllier put Ince on the transfer list and the 31-year-old signed for [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] for £1&nbsp;million in July 1999. He was signed by his former Manchester United midfield partner [[Bryan Robson]].<ref name=tees>{{cite news |last1=Vickers |first1=Anthony |title=On Reflection: For all his pugnacious petulance, Paul Ince was a fantastic player for Boro |url=https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/reflection-pugnacious-petulance-paul-ince-11949678 |access-date=20 February 2022 |publisher=Teesside Live |date=28 September 2016}}</ref>

Ince received 11, 9 and 10 yellow cards in his three respective seasons.<ref name=tees/> On 22 October 2001, in a 2–0 home win over rivals [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], he was sent off for putting his hands to [[Niall Quinn]]'s face.<ref>{{cite news |title=Boro sink Sunderland |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/1607674.stm |access-date=20 February 2022 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 October 2001}}</ref> The following 10 March, he scored in a 3–0 victory against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at the [[Riverside Stadium]] to put Boro into the semifinals of the FA Cup,<ref>{{cite news |title=Middlesbrough thrash Everton |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/1860677.stm |access-date=20 February 2022 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 March 2002}}</ref> but he missed the defeat to Arsenal in that round due to suspension.<ref>{{cite news |title=Arsenal break brave Boro |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/1924953.stm |access-date=20 February 2022 |date=14 April 2002}}</ref>

In July 2002, Ince left Boro after turning down a two-year contract extension, citing the long commute from his home in the northwest. He played 106 games for Boro, scoring nine goals.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ince calls time on Boro career |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jul/02/newsstory.sport |access-date=20 February 2022 |work=The Guardian |date=2 July 2002}}</ref>

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
In August 2002, Ince signed a one-year contract with [[Football League First Division]] side [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], who had just signed his former Manchester United teammate [[Denis Irwin]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ince agrees Wolves move |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/2164254.stm |access-date=20 February 2022 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 August 2002}}</ref> In his first season outside top-flight football, he helped the team to promotion via a 3–0 win over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the [[2003 Football League First Division play-off Final|play-off final]], assisting the second goal by [[Nathan Blake]].<ref name=playoff>{{cite news |title=After 19 years and 13 days hungry Wolves tear into the top flight |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/may/27/match.sport |access-date=20 February 2022 |work=The Guardian |date=27 May 2003}}</ref>

In April 2006, Ince announced that he wanted to continue playing for Wolves for a further season after speaking with his friend [[Teddy Sheringham]]. However, following Ince's failure to get the manager's job at Wolves in July 2006 on Hoddle's resignation, the newly appointed manager, [[Mick McCarthy]], decided not to offer Ince a new contract.

Ince's only international goals came on his 12th appearance.

==Managerial career==
===Swindon Town (player-coach)===
Ince signed a one-year contract with [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] as a player/coach on 31 August 2006. Swindon beat the likes of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[West Bromwich Albion]] for his signature.

===Macclesfield Town===
On 23 October 2006, Ince was confirmed as the new player-manager of [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] in succession to [[Brian Horton]].
