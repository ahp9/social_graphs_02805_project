'''Christian Jürgen Gross''' (born 14 August 1954) is a Swiss [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former player. He played as a [[Defender (association football)#Sweeper (libero)|sweeper]] and [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sport.de/fussball/pe9115/christian-gross/ |title=Christian Gross at Sport.de |website=Sport.de |access-date=4 December 2019 |language=de}}</ref>

Gross was manager of [[FC Basel|Basel]] from 1999 to 2009, winning four [[Swiss Super League]]s and four [[Swiss Cup]]s.

As manager of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] between November 1997 and September 1998, Gross became the first Swiss to manage in the [[Premier League]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/features/around-the-world-switzerland.html|title=Around the World: Switzerland and the Barclays Premier League|date=31 May 2014|publisher=Premier League|access-date=6 October 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006144901/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/features/around-the-world-switzerland.html|archive-date=6 October 2015}}</ref>

==Playing career==
Gross began his playing career at [[SV Höngg]] before moving to [[Grasshopper Club Zürich|Grasshopper]] in 1965,<ref>{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Herzog |title=Der neue Trainer hält YB bereits auf Trab |url=https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/sport/fussball/Der-neue-Trainer-haelt-YB-bereits-auf-Trab-/story/17545585?track |newspaper=[[Tages-Anzeiger]] |date=14 May 2011 |access-date=4 December 2019 |language=de}}</ref> which he left in 1976. After two years at [[FC Lausanne-Sport|Lausanne-Sport]] and two seasons at [[Neuchâtel Xamax FCS|Neuchâtel Xamax]], he moved to Germany in 1980 to play for [[VfL Bochum]] of the [[Bundesliga]]. In two seasons Gross made 29 appearances in the Bundesliga and scored four goals. He then returned to Switzerland and spent three years at [[FC St. Gallen|St. Gallen]], [[FC Lugano|Lugano]] and [[Yverdon-Sport FC|Yverdon-Sport]]. Gross was capped once for [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], making his debut on 8 March 1978 in a 3–1 friendly away defeat to [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]].<ref>{{cite news |first1=Mac |last1=Huber |first2=Daniel |last2=Leu |first3=Nicola |last3=Berger |title=Gross und andere Eintagsfliegen im Natitrikot |url=https://www.blick.ch/sport/fussball/nati/gross-und-andere-eintagsfliegen-im-natitrikot-id5437.html |newspaper=[[Blick]] |date=6 September 2018 |access-date=4 December 2019 |language=de}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
===Early career===
Gross began his managerial career at Swiss side [[FC Wil|Wil]] in the [[2. Liga (Switzerland)|2. Liga]] (then the fourth-highest level), for whom he was active as [[Player-coach|player-manager]]. During his reign from 1988 to 1993,<ref name="Christian Gross—Trainer-Info">{{cite web|title=Christian Gross|url=https://www.kicker.de/christian-gross/trainer|publisher=kicker|access-date=29 January 2014|language=de}}</ref> Wil climbed into the [[Swiss 1. Liga (football)|1. Liga]] and then the Nationalliga B (now the [[Swiss Challenge League|Challenge League]]). While at Wil, Gross developed a reputation for an emphasis on fitness and hard work.<ref name="blogs.guardian.co.uk">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/20/1 |title=Guardian Unlimited: Sport blog: On Second Thoughts: Christian Gross |work=The Guardian |date= 20 November 2007 |access-date= 8 April 2009 | location=London | first=Paul | last=Doyle}}</ref> He then joined Grasshopper as head coach in 1993.<ref name="Grasshoppers Zürich » Trainerhistorie">{{cite web|title=Grasshoppers Zürich " Trainerhistorie|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/grasshoppers-zuerich/9/|publisher=World Football|access-date=29 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203031701/http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/grasshoppers-zuerich/9/|archive-date=3 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Under Gross, Grasshopper won two Swiss championships and the [[Swiss Cup]]. Gross's success with Grasshopper meant he was a very highly rated coach in his native Switzerland, but he was still little-known outside central Europe and it was a major shock when in November 1997 he was chosen to succeed [[Gerry Francis]] as manager of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Sugar set to explain Gross appointment |url=http://www.fa-carling.com/news9798/thfc/th19119701.html |website=FA Premier League |date=19 November 1997 |access-date=4 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990222014623/http://www.fa-carling.com/news9798/thfc/th19119701.html |archive-date=22 February 1999}}</ref>

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Gross was hired on 19 November 1997,<ref>{{cite news |first1=Christopher |last1=Davies |first2=Mihir |last2=Bose |title=Spurs find Swiss replacement as Francis departs |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1997/11/19/sfngro19.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 November 1997 |access-date=4 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050317093250/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1997%2F11%2F19%2Fsfngro19.html |archive-date=17 March 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with Tottenham in the relegation zone.<ref name="Christian Gross to Juande Ramos: Tottenham managers that came and went">{{cite news|title=Christian Gross to Juande Ramos: Tottenham managers that came and went|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/3110219/Tottenhams-managerial-timeline-Football.html|access-date=29 January 2014|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 September 2008|author=Macaskill, Sandy|author2=Gilmour, Rod}}</ref> Swiss fitness coach [[Fritz Schmid (football manager)|Fritz Schmid]], who had been an integral part of Gross' training plans at Grasshopper, was denied a [[work permit]] by the British government and so was unable to take up this role at Tottenham.<ref>{{cite news |title=Coach Gross' future at Tottenham in doubt after permit refused |url=http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/archives.php?id=5519 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News|Turkish Daily News]] |date=31 December 1997 |access-date=4 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171433/http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/archives.php?id=5519 |archive-date=30 September 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Doyle|first=Paul|title=On Second Thoughts: Christian Gross|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/20/1|access-date=29 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 November 2007}}</ref>

Gross' initial fortunes were mixed; his debut was a 2–0 win over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at [[Goodison Park]], followed by a heavy 6–1 home defeat at the hands of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. However, despite some signs of improvement, he was relentlessly ridiculed by the British tabloids.<ref name="blogs.guardian.co.uk"/> The ridicule was often linked to his poor grasp of English and first Spurs press conference, where he arrived late from [[Heathrow Airport]] brandishing a [[London Underground]] ticket with the words: "I want this to become my ticket to the dreams".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topspurs.com/cgross.htm |title = Christian Gross: 25 November 1997 – 5 September 1998 |publisher = Topspurs |access-date= 8 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.onthisfootballday.com/football-history/september-5-sir-alan-sugars-apprentice.php | title = September 5 – Sir Alan Sugar's Apprentice | date = 5 September 2007 | access-date = 30 April 2010 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111005233604/http://www.onthisfootballday.com/football-history/september-5-sir-alan-sugars-apprentice.php | archive-date = 5 October 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.football365.com/story/0,17033,8750_4239904,00.html |title=F365's Most Memorable Press Conferences – F365 Features – Football365 News |publisher=Football365.com |access-date=8 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006050559/http://www.football365.com/story/0,17033,8750_4239904,00.html |archive-date=6 October 2008 }}</ref>

Gross' position became increasingly untenable as the [[1998–99 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|1998–99]] season approached, and when Spurs lost two of their opening three matches, chairman [[Alan Sugar]] ended Gross' contract on 5 September 1998. In a statement, Sugar blamed the media for destroying Gross' reputation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/165785.stm |title = Gross: 'I was sacked' |work=BBC News |date= 6 September 1998 |access-date=8 April 2009}}</ref> He had won three of his last ten matches.<ref name="Christian Gross to Juande Ramos: Tottenham managers that came and went"/>

===Basel===
Gross returned to his native Switzerland, finding work as the manager of [[FC Basel|Basel]] on 15 June 1999.<ref>{{cite news |first=Josef |last=Zindel |title=120 Jahre FCB! |url=https://www.fcb.ch/de-CH/News/2013/11/16/120-Jahre-FCB |website=FC Basel official website |date=16 November 2013 |access-date=4 December 2019 |language=de |archive-date=4 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191204131453/https://www.fcb.ch/de-CH/News/2013/11/16/120-Jahre-FCB |url-status=dead }}</ref> He worked to rebuild Basel into the premier force in Swiss football and achieved greater success than when manager of Grasshopper.

Under Gross' guidance, Basel won four Swiss championships, four Swiss Cups, and mounted a fairytale run in the [[UEFA Champions League]] in the [[2002–03 UEFA Champions League|2002–03]] season, beating eventual finalists [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] as well as knocking out [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and drawing with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (twice) and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Gross' success in these games against British sides went a long way towards restoring his reputation among the British media and fans.<ref name="blogs.guardian.co.uk"/> He took Basel on another European adventure three seasons later as they reached the quarter finals of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in 2005–06, before bowing out to English side [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] 4–3 on aggregate despite leading 2–0 after the first leg at [[St. Jakob-Park]].

On 17 May 2009, Gross was attacked by fans of [[FC Zürich|Zürich]] on a tram after Basel defeated Zürich that day. He received no serious injuries.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2009/05/19/yobs-spit-on-gross-115875-21370832/ | title = Former Tottenham manager attacked by yobs | work = Daily Mirror | access-date = 30 April 2010| date = 19 May 2009}}</ref> On 27 May, he was sacked after ten years at the club.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12003_5351223,00.html | title = Gross to leave Basel| publisher = Sky Sports | access-date = 30 April 2010 | date = 27 May 2009}}</ref>

Gross was dismissed from his managerial job on 13 October 2010 after six defeats in seven matches, when Stuttgart found itself at the bottom of the table.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.kicker.de/gross-beurlaubt---bobic_keine-loesungsansaetze-543509/artikel  | title = Gross beurlaubt – Bobic: "Keine Lösungsansätze" | date = 13 October 2009 | access-date = 13 October 2010 | work = [[Kicker (magazine)|Kicker]] | language = de}}</ref>

===Zamalek===
In April 2018, Gross signed a two-year contract with the Egyptian club [[Zamalek SC|Zamalek]]. He won The Egyptian-Saudi Supercup 2018, and followed that up with a win in the African Confederation Cup in May 2019, which was the first African title for the Egyptian giants since 2002. The deal appeared to collapse in May after the confederation cup final, but it was confirmed to be a one-year deal on 3 July 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44700133 |title=Swiss coach Christian Gross agrees deal with Zamalek after all |publisher=BBC |author=Tarek Talaat |date= 3 July 2018 |access-date=13 July 2018 }}</ref> On 1 June 2019, ''[[Egypt Today]]'' confirmed that Gross had been fired from his position, President [[Mortada Mansour]] of the club told [[Mehwar TV]] that "Gross is specialist in failure".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/8/71085/Zamalek-President-fires-team-coach-Christian-Gross |title=Zamalek president fires team coach Christian Gross |work=Egypt Today |date=1 June 2019 |access-date=8 June 2019 }}</ref>
