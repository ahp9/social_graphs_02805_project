'''Leslie Mark Hughes''' (born 1 November 1963) is a Welsh [[association football|football]] coach and former player who is the head coach of {{English football updater|CarlislU}} club [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]].

During his playing career he usually operated as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] or [[midfielder]]. He had two spells at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and also played for [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], as well as the English clubs [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and finally [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. He made 72 appearances for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] scoring 16 goals. He won a host of winners' medals during his playing career, including two Premier League titles, four [[FA Cup]]s, three [[EFL Cup|League Cups]] and two [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]s. He also collected an FA Cup runners-up medal and a League Cup runners-up medal. Hughes was the first player to win the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] award twice, in 1989 and 1991, as well as having been the only person to have scored in the [[FA Community Shield]], League Cup final, and FA Cup final in the same season (1993–94). He retired from playing in 2002.

Hughes was appointed manager of Wales in 1999 and remained in the role until 2004. He failed to qualify for a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] or [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] during his five years in charge, although his reign coincided with a marked improvement in results. Wales came particularly close to securing [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying|2004 European Championship qualification]]. Hughes then spent four years in charge of Blackburn, guiding them to sixth place in [[2005–06 Blackburn Rovers F.C. season|2005–06]]. He took charge of [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in June 2008 for a year and a half before spending the [[2010–11 Fulham F.C. season|2010–11]] season at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. He joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in January 2012, helping them retain their Premier League status in [[2011–12 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season|2011–12]]. Despite some high-profile signings in the summer of 2012, QPR began the [[2012–13 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season|2012–13]] season in very poor form, and Hughes was dismissed on 23 November 2012.<ref name=Guardian231112>{{cite web|title=Mark Hughes sacked by QPR|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/23/mark-hughes-sacked-by-qpr|work=The Guardian|access-date=23 November 2012|date=23 November 2012}}</ref>

Hughes was appointed manager of [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on 30 May 2013. He guided the club to three consecutive ninth-place Premier League finishes in [[2013–14 Stoke City F.C. season|2013–14]], [[2014–15 Stoke City F.C. season|2014–15]] and [[2015–16 Stoke City F.C. season|2015–16]]. Progress at Stoke stalled in the [[2016–17 Stoke City F.C. season|2016–17]] season, with the club finishing 13th in the table. Following a poor start to the [[2017–18 Stoke City F.C. season|2017–18]] season, with the club in the relegation zone heading into the new year, he was dismissed by Stoke on 6 January 2018, hours after an FA Cup third round exit to [[EFL League Two|League Two]] side [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]].<ref name="SSACK">{{cite web|title=Mark Hughes: Stoke City sack manager after poor run|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42332958|website=BBC Sport|date=6 January 2018 |access-date=6 January 2018}}</ref> He was appointed manager of Southampton on 14 March 2018, signing a contract until the end of the season, with Southampton one point above his former club Stoke in 17th place at the time of his appointment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43403577|title=Mark Hughes: Southampton appoint former Stoke manager until end of season|work=BBC Sport|date=14 March 2018 | access-date = 15 March 2018}}</ref> He guided the club to safety at the end of the [[2017–18 Southampton F.C. season|2017–18]] season, but was dismissed in December 2018 with the club at 18th in the table.<ref name = BBC46091577/>

==Club career==
===Manchester United===
Born in [[Ruabon]], [[Wrexham]],<ref name=Hugman/> Hughes joined [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] after leaving school in the summer of 1980, having been spotted by the team's North Wales talent scout Hugh Roberts.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4924264.stm |title=Old Trafford scout Roberts dies |work=BBC Sport |date=19 April 2006 |access-date=2 June 2013}}</ref> However, he did not make his first team debut for three years&nbsp;– scoring in a 1–1 draw away to [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]], in the [[1983–84 in English football|1983–84]] season.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

When Hughes made his United debut, the club's forward partnership consisted of 27-year-old [[Republic of Ireland|Irishman]] [[Frank Stapleton]] and 18-year-old [[Norman Whiteside]] from Northern Ireland, and breaking up that partnership would not be an easy challenge for Hughes. But Hughes quickly broke into the first team, partnering Frank Stapleton in attack while [[Norman Whiteside]] was switched to midfield to partner [[Ray Wilkins]] and stand in for the injury prone [[Remi Moses]]. The departure of Wilkins to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] at the end of the season saw manager [[Ron Atkinson]] decide to stick to using Whiteside in the centre of midfield, enabling Hughes to keep his place in the first team ahead of new signing [[Alan Brazil]], and he was rewarded handsomely as he scored 25 goals in 55 matches across all competitions as United achieved an FA Cup final victory over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. They also finished fourth in the league.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Hughes managed a further 18 goals in the [[1985–86 in English football|1985–86 season]], where they led until February having won their first ten league matches of the season, before a dismal second half of the season saw them slip into fourth place in the final table. That season saw him score 17 goals in the [[Football League First Division]] – it would remain the highest goals tally in a league season throughout his career.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Barcelona===
In the summer of 1986, Hughes was sold to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] for £2&nbsp;million. United announced on 21 March 1986 that Hughes would be heading for Spain at the end of the season, but the transfer had been agreed many weeks earlier.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Manager [[Terry Venables]] signed Hughes at the same time that he signed [[Gary Lineker]] from Everton to form a new strike partnership at the [[Camp Nou]], but Hughes was a disappointment in his only season at Barcelona, scoring only 5 times in 37 games, whereas Lineker proved a success in three seasons at the club, scoring 51 in 138 games.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jugadors |first=F.

====Loan to Bayern Munich====
He was subsequently loaned out to West German club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] for the 1987–88 season, where he regained his form. On 11 November 1987, he played two competitive matches in one day, first for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] in [[Prague]] in a [[UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying Group 6|Euro 1988 qualifier]], and second, after being flown across the border into [[West Germany]], appearing as a substitute for Bayern in their win over [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] in a [[1987–88 DFB-Pokal#2nd round|DFB-Pokal second round replay]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sparky+Czech-ed+out+Prague+and+Germany.-a0149442787 |title=Sparky Czech-ed out Prague and Germany |first=Ian |last=Carbis |work=South Wales Echo |access-date=1 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Williams |first1=Aled |title=Bayern Munich and Wales: Mark Hughes' two games in two countries in a day |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46097218 |publisher=BBC Wales Sport |access-date=6 November 2018 |date=5 November 2018}}</ref>

===Return to Manchester United===
[[File:Mark Hughes juli 1991.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Hughes with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 1991.]]
In May 1988, Hughes returned to Manchester United, managed by [[Alex Ferguson]], for a then club record fee of £1.8&nbsp;million. As he had done in his first spell at [[Old Trafford]], Hughes proved to be a dynamic goalscorer and was a key player for the club over the next seven years. Alex Ferguson had been keen on re-signing Hughes for United soon after becoming manager in November 1986, but Hughes would have been liable for taxation on money earned playing overseas if he had returned to England before April 1988.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]], his first season back in England, United disappointed in the league and finished 11th after an erratic season. They had gone ten league matches without a win in the autumn but then went on a strong run after the turn of the new year to lift them to third place, only for a late season collapse to drag them down to mid-table. Hughes was voted [[PFA Player of the Year]], the first Manchester United player to be credited with that award, in its 16th season. He was also United's joint top scorer that season, along with [[Brian McClair]], on 16 goals.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

A year later, Hughes scored twice as United drew 3–3 with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the [[1990 FA Cup final]], before a [[Lee Martin (footballer, born February 1968)|Lee Martin]] goal in the replay gave United their first major trophy in five years. He was United's top goalscorer that season, scoring 15 goals in all competitions; 13 of his goals had come in the league, where United finished a disappointing 13th. He scored his third United hat-trick in a September clash against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in the league at Old Trafford, which United won 5–1.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The following season, Hughes scored both goals against former club Barcelona as United lifted the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], winning the [[1991 European Cup Winners' Cup final|final]] 2–1 in [[Rotterdam]]. Once again, he was their top scorer, this time with 21 goals in all competitions, although his tally in the league was bettered by Brian McClair and [[Steve Bruce]]. They also reached the [[1991 Football League Cup final|Football League Cup final]] that year, but United suffered a shock 1–0 defeat to a [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] side managed by [[Ron Atkinson]], who had been Hughes's manager in his first spell at Old Trafford. Hughes was also voted [[PFA Player of the Year]] again this season. The [[1991–92 Manchester United F.C. season|1990–91]] season also saw Hughes score the last of his four hat-tricks for United, in a League Cup quarter-final replay against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] at Old Trafford, which United won 3–2. In [[1991–92 Manchester United F.C. season|1991–92]], Hughes suffered the disappointment of missing out on a league title medal as United were pipped to the title by [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], but had some compensation in the form of a League Cup winner's medal. He found the net 11 times in the league and 14 times in all competitions.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

For much of the 1991–92 season, United had been linked with a move for the Southampton striker [[Alan Shearer]], but the player chose to stay at the [[South Coast of England|South Coast]] club until the season's end before making a decision about his future, before deciding to sign for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. Sir Alex Ferguson remained intent on signing a new striker for United that summer, although it was far from clear whether it was Hughes or his strike-partner Brian McClair who would lose his place in the first team or be switched to another position in order to accommodate a new signing. Ferguson's hunt for a new striker ended with the acquisition of [[Dion Dublin]], although Dublin was injured after playing just a few matches for the club, and it was not long before United were in the hunt for another new striker, as a lack of goals were seeing them slip behind in the title race. [[Eric Cantona]] was eventually signed at the end of November, which prompted interest from [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] manager [[Kevin Keegan]], who had first asked Ferguson about Hughes's availability that summer. Ferguson, however, insisted that Hughes was not for sale, and he remained a regular choice in the first team, playing alongside Cantona while McClair was mostly selected in central midfield from then on.<ref>{{cite web|title=Football: United spurn Keegan's pursuit of Hughes|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-united-spurn-keegans-pursuit-of-hughes-1560908.html|website=The Independent|date=December 1992 |access-date=22 June 2016}}</ref>

In May 1993, Hughes finally collected an English league title medal as United won the first-ever [[Premier League]] title; Hughes was United's top scorer with 15 goals in the league and a further goal in the League Cup. From December, he mostly played alongside new signing Eric Cantona in attack, with Brian McClair being switched to the centre of midfield. Hughes collected yet more silverware in 1994 as United won the league title as well as the [[FA Cup]], with Hughes scoring in the final. He also scored Manchester United's consolation goal in their 3–1 defeat in the 1994 League Cup Final at the hands of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at Wembley in that season. In so doing, he became only the second player (after [[Norman Whiteside]] in 1983) to score in the finals of both the domestic cups in the same season. This has since been achieved a third time by [[Didier Drogba]] in 2007. His partnership with Cantona in attack also went from strength to strength, as he found the net 22 times in all competitions as Cantona scored a further 25.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In December 1994, with United second to Blackburn in the race for the league title, media reports were linking United with the signature of several highly rated strikers including [[Andy Cole]] and [[Stan Collymore]], and there had already been some impressive performances in the first team from 20-year-old striker [[Paul Scholes]]. Hughes was now widely tipped to be the player most likely to lose his place to any new signing in the forward positions, and when United completed the £7&nbsp;million signing of Cole on 10 January 1995, it was almost immediately reported that new [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] manager [[Joe Royle]] was tabling a £2.5&nbsp;million bid for Hughes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hughes expected to give way to £16m Cole|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-hughes-expected-to-give-way-to-1637m-cole-1567583.html|website=The Independent|date=11 January 1995 |access-date=22 June 2016}}</ref>

Four days later, however, Hughes suffered a knee injury early in a match against Newcastle, colliding with opposition goalkeeper [[Pavel Srníček]] as he scored a goal. The injury was initially feared to be cruciate knee ligament damage, which would inevitably have put him out of action for at least the rest of the season, but it was instead revealed to be a serious gash, and he was back in action within a month, during which time United were left without the services of Eric Cantona, who attacked a [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] fan and was subsequently banned for eight months.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hughes injury blow to United|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-hughes-injury-blow-to-united-1568312.html|website=The Independent|date=16 January 1995 |access-date=22 June 2016}}</ref> Hughes now found himself with his first team place still looking secure, at least in the short term, and in partnership with Andy Cole. He even signed a new two-year contract.<ref>{{cite web|title=Main man of United|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/profile-main-man-of-united-1610783.html|website=The Independent|date=10 March 1995 |access-date=22 June 2016}}</ref>

Hughes came close to winning both the Premier League and FA Cup again in 1995, but a failure to beat [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on the final day of the season and the inability to score an equaliser against Everton in the FA Cup final a week later condemned United to their first trophyless season in six years. The FA Cup final was his last match in a United shirt. Hughes scored eight league goals in 1994–95 (two of them in the 9–0 defeat of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] at Old Trafford on 4 March 1995) and managed a total of 12 in all competitions (two in the FA Cup and another two in the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]). During two spells at the club, he had found the net a total of 163 times (116 of his goals coming during his second spell). Perhaps the most memorable of those goals came in April 1994, when he scored a spectacular equaliser in the final minute of extra time in the FA Cup semi-final against [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] at Wembley.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

By the time of his departure from Manchester United, he was the last player at the club to have been there before the appointment of Sir Alex Ferguson as manager in November 1986,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} albeit having left for Barcelona before Ferguson was hired and then returning two years into his stint as manager.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mark Hughes at Manchester United's official player page |url=https://www.manutd.com/en/players-and-staff/detail/mark-hughes}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Alex Ferguson timeline at ESPN | date=30 May 2014 |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/37377281/sir-alex-ferguson-line-manchester-united%3fplatform=amp}}</ref>

===Chelsea===
Hughes left Old Trafford for the second and final time in June 1995 when he was sold to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for £1&nbsp;million, in a summer that also saw the departures of players such as [[Paul Ince]] (to [[Inter Milan]]) and [[Andrei Kanchelskis]] (to Everton). Hughes scored a consolation goal for Chelsea in the home Premier League fixture against Manchester United in [[1995–96 in English football|1995–96]]; a 4–1 win for United at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] in October.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chelsea 1 Manchester United 4 |url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/chelsea-v-manchester-united-21-october-1995-22264/|website=11v11.com|access-date=16 March 2017|date=21 October 1995}}</ref> He was on the losing side again as United beat Chelsea 2–1 in the FA Cup semi-final that season, less than two years after he had scored one of United's goals in their FA Cup final triumph over Chelsea.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manchester United 2 Chelsea 1|url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/manchester-united-v-chelsea-31-march-1996-217209/|website=11v11.com|access-date=16 March 2017|date=31 March 1996}}</ref>

Hughes was one of the key players in Chelsea's resurgence as a top club in the late 1990s, forming a potent strike partnership with [[Gianfranco Zola]] and helping to freeze out [[Gianluca Vialli]] (who became the club's player-manager in February 1998). He put in match-winning performances against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in the FA Cup in 1997, and [[Vicenza Calcio|Vicenza]] in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] a year later, playing a big part in Chelsea's glory in both of these competitions. In winning the FA Cup, he became the only player in the 20th century to win the trophy four times. He ended his Chelsea career with 39 goals from 123 matches and was transferred to Southampton for £650,000 in July 1998.<ref name="Sou"/>

===Southampton===
In July 1998, Hughes was signed by Southampton for a fee of £650,000<ref name="Sou">{{cite news |title=Hughes signs for Saints |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/130230.stm |work=BBC News |date=11 July 1998 |access-date=2 April 2012 }}</ref> by manager [[Dave Jones (football manager)|Dave Jones]], as an alternative to injury-plagued [[David Hirst (footballer)|David Hirst]],<ref name="ITN">{{cite book |title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last1=Holley |first1=Duncan |last2=Chalk |first2=Gary |publisher=Hagiology |year=2003 |isbn=0-9534474-3-X |pages=529–530 }}</ref> who retired within 18 months of Hughes's arrival. The goals failed to flow and Hughes was pushed back into midfield, where his experience helped Southampton maintain their Premier League status.<ref name="ITN"/>

His two goals for Southampton came against Blackburn Rovers, who he was later to join, and a "memorable volley" at home to Newcastle on 15 August 1999.<ref name="ITN"/> Hughes had disciplinary problems throughout his career, and in [[1998–99 in English football|his first season]] at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]] he received 14 yellow cards, a total which has not been exceeded in the Premier League {{as of|2022|lc=yes}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/Statistics/0,,12306,00.html |title=Official Site of the Premier League&nbsp;– Barclays Premier League News, Fixtures and Results &#124; Statistics |publisher=Premier League |access-date=20 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230130252/http://www.premierleague.com/page/Statistics/0,,12306,00.html |archive-date=30 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.premierleague.com/stats/records |access-date=3 December 2022|title=Premier League Records |publisher=Premierleague.com}}</ref>

===Everton===
When [[Glenn Hoddle]] arrived as Southampton's manager in January 2000, Hughes did not fit into his plans and he left for Everton in March 2000. He played 16 times over the course of seven months for Everton,<ref>{{cite web|title=Mark Hughes|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/players/m/mh/mark-hughes|website=Everton|access-date=22 June 2016}}</ref> scoring his only goal against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Moore's double as Hughes stars |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/697991.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 April 2000 |access-date=17 October 2025}}</ref>

===Blackburn Rovers===
Hughes left Goodison Park on a free transfer for Blackburn Rovers in October 2000, moving outside the top division for the first time in his playing career in [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01]]. He played a key role in getting Blackburn promoted from Division One in 2001. He also lifted the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] with Blackburn in February 2002,<ref>{{cite news |title=Cole strike stuns Spurs |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/worthington_cup/1834988.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=24 February 2002 |access-date=20 September 2009 }}</ref> before finally hanging up his boots in July 2002 a few months short of his 39th birthday.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mark Hughes|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/wales/2577591.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=31 December 2002|access-date=20 September 2009 }}</ref>

Hughes's final career goal came in a 2–1 Premier League defeat to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on 30 March 2002. At the time, he was the second oldest player to score in the Premier League, behind [[Stuart Pearce]].

Hughes scored just 17 minutes into his [[Wales national football team|Wales]] debut, scoring the winning goal against [[England national football team|England]] on 2 May 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablesw/wal-intres80.html |title=Wales – International Results 1980–1989 – Details |date=20 May 2004 |access-date=2 June 2013 |first=Barrie |website=[[RSSSF]] |last=Courtney}}</ref> He went on to play 72 times for his country, scoring 16 times.<ref name=nf/>

==Managerial career==

===Wales===
Hughes was appointed as head coach of the Wales national team in 1999,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dragonsoccer.co.uk/news0899.htm |title=Latest news&nbsp;– August 1999 |website=Dragonsoccer.co.uk |access-date=20 September 2009}}</ref> while still playing elite club football for a few more seasons. Initially appointed on a temporary basis alongside [[Neville Southall]] to replace [[Bobby Gould]], Hughes had soon done enough to earn himself a long-term contract, with Southall eventually leaving the set-up.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/07/England_vWales_HughesProfile.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20050406192228/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/07/England_vWales_HughesProfile.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 April 2005 |title=On familiar ground |website=TheFA.com |date=7 October 2004 |access-date=2 June 2013 |first=Dean |last=Jones}}</ref> When he took over, Wales were going through a bad patch but in the five years with Hughes in charge, Wales came close to qualifying for [[UEFA Euro 2004]].

Hughes quit the Welsh national side in September 2004 to take charge of Blackburn in the FA Premier League, the last club he had played for.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Walsh |title=Hughes leaves a void |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_of_wales/3661852.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=16 September 2004 |access-date=4 December 2008 }}</ref> His key aim was to keep Blackburn clear of relegation, which he succeeded in doing, while also taking the club to an FA Cup semi-final for the first time in over 40 years.<ref>{{cite news |title=Arsenal 3–0 Blackburn |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/4427433.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=16 April 2006 |access-date=4 December 2008 }}</ref>

In his second season, he helped Blackburn finish inside the top six of the Premier League and subsequently qualify for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], beating teams such as Chelsea, Manchester United (twice) and Arsenal en route. After just missing out on the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final, his team sealed their spot in Europe by defeating champions Chelsea 1–0 at home.<ref>{{cite news |title=Blackburn 1–0 Chelsea |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4957422.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=2 May 2006 |access-date=4 December 2008 }}</ref> On 4 May 2006, Hughes and assistant [[Mark Bowen (footballer)|Mark Bowen]] signed new three-year contracts to remain at Blackburn until the summer of 2009.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hughes signs new Blackburn deal |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/7108934.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=23 November 2007 |access-date=4 December 2008 }}</ref>

Hughes then set about creating a formidable side at Ewood Park.

Manchester City beat [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] 5–1 and Arsenal 3–0 in the League Cup to reach their first semi-final since 1981. Hughes then led City to their first victory over his former club Chelsea for five years with a 2–1 victory.

===Fulham===
On 29 July 2010, Hughes became the new manager of Fulham, following the departure of [[Roy Hodgson]] to Liverpool. Hughes agreed a two-year contract with the London side and was officially unveiled to the media on 3 August 2010, before his first match as manager on 7 August against [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]]. Hughes was joined at Fulham by his backroom team of [[Eddie Niedzwiecki]], Mark Bowen and [[Kevin Hitchcock]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Mark Hughes named new manager of Premier League Fulham |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8866133.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=29 July 2010 |access-date=29 July 2010 }}</ref> His first league match in charge of the Cottagers came exactly a week later, when they drew 0–0 at [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on the opening day of the Premier League season, followed by a resolute display against Manchester United in a 2–2 draw at [[Craven Cottage]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Les |last=Roopanarine|title=Bolton 0–0 Fulham |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8906326.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=14 August 2010 |access-date=25 August 2010 }}</ref>

Draws followed in four of Fulham's next five Premier League matches against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], Blackburn Rovers, Everton and West Ham, with a solitary 2–1 home win over Wolves. This meant that at that stage – including the seven-draw streak at Manchester City before his dismissal the season before – all but two (86%) of Hughes's last fifteen Premiership matches had been drawn. The bizarre run, exclusively made up of draws or 2–1 results, continued with 2–1 defeats to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in the second half of October 2010. At the end of the [[2010–11 Fulham F.C. season|2010–11 season]], Hughes led Fulham to an eighth-placed finish in the league and UEFA Europa League qualification through the Fair Play league.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fulham gain Europa League spot through Fair Play league|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/13492544|website=BBC Sport|date=22 May 2011 |access-date=22 June 2016}}</ref>

Stoke made a poor start to the new season.
