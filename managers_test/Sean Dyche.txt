'''Sean Mark Dyche''' ({{IPAc-en|d|aɪ|tʃ}};<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYygb_snNEw|title=Sean Dyche answers journalist's phone|website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref> born 28 June 1971) is an English professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Association football|footballer]] who is the head coach of [[Premier League]] club [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. 

During his playing career, Dyche played as a [[centre-back]], making his professional debut in 1990 and representing [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] – whom he [[Captain (association football)|captained]] and scored for in an [[FA Cup]] semi-final. He also played for [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]]. He was promoted with three of his six clubs. After retiring as a player in 2007, he coached at Watford, including a stint as manager between June 2011 and July 2012.

After leaving Watford, Dyche became the manager of [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in October 2012. He guided the club to two promotions to the Premier League, in [[2013–14 Burnley F.C. season|2013–14]] and [[2015–16 Burnley F.C. season|2015–16]]. During the [[2017–18 Burnley F.C. season|2017–18 season]], he led Burnley to [[Burnley F.C. in European football|their first European campaign since 1967]], following a seventh-place league finish. Dyche became the longest-serving manager in the Premier League at the end of the [[2019–20 Premier League|2019–20 season]]. He was dismissed by Burnley in April 2022, when the club was in the relegation zone. Dyche was appointed manager of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in January 2023, and was dismissed two years later. In October 2025, he was appointed manager of [[Nottingham Forest]].

==Playing career==
Dyche was a youth-team player at [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in the late 1980s, while [[Brian Clough]] was manager. When he joined Forest he was {{height|ft=5|in=8}} and weighed 10 stone but grew to {{height|ft=6}} and 12 stone after a year. He injured his leg early in his career, which Dyche said held him back. It also left him with a permanent bend in his leg.<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news|title=Burnley manager Sean Dyche eager to take Championship leaders into the Premier League|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/burnley/10516775/Burnley-manager-Sean-Dyche-eager-to-take-Championship-leaders-into-the-Premier-League.html|work=Daily Telegraph|access-date=21 December 2013|date=13 December 2013}}</ref> Dyche was present at the [[Hillsborough disaster]], having travelled to the stadium as part of the Forest youth side.<ref name="Everton">{{cite news|title=Manager's Programme Notes for Fulham Clash|url=https://www.evertonfc.com/news/3147690/managers-programme-notes-for-fulham-clash|access-date=8 October 2023}}</ref>

He left Forest in early 1990 without making a first-team appearance, and signed for [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]], where he later became [[Captain (association football)|captain]]. Dyche was part of the team that reached the [[FA Cup]] semi-finals in [[1996–97 FA Cup|1997]]. In the FA Cup semi-final against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], he scored a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] to put his side 2–0 up in an eventual 3–3 draw. Chesterfield lost the replay 3–0.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/30628270|title=FA Cup archive: Middlesbrough v Chesterfield, 1997 semi-final|work=BBC Sport |access-date=2 September 2016}}</ref>

Dyche left Chesterfield for [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] in 1997, helping them win promotion to [[Football League First Division|Division One]] in his first season. City were relegated the following season, during which Dyche spent time on loan at [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. He moved to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] for £150,000 in 1999, but only played once in his first season due to a back injury.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dixon |first1=Jamie |title=Dyche set for Millwall return |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/2190783/dyche-set-for-millwall-return |access-date=23 October 2025 |work=Sky Sports}}</ref> He won promotion to Division One in 2001 and came close to a [[Premier League]] place the following year, losing to eventual promotion winners [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the play-off semi-finals.<ref>{{cite news |title=Birmingham snatch dramatic win |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/1962328.stm |access-date=23 October 2025 |work=BBC Sport |date=2 May 2002}}</ref>
