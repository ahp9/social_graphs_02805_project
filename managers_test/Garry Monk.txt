Monk, a [[centre back]], began his playing career with  [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] before joining [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. In nearly eight years, he rarely appeared for the club, instead spending time [[loan (association football)|on loan]] at Torquay United, [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]], [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. In 2004 he signed for [[EFL League Two|League Two]] club [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], and over the next ten years played for them in all four divisions of fully professional football, for the majority of that time as captain, made 270 appearances in all competitions, and was a member of their [[2013 Football League Cup final|2013 League Cup final]]-winning team.

He began his managerial career with Swansea City, and later took charge of [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] before joining Cambridge United in March 2024.
