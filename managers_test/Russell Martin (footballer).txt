==Managerial style==
{{Quote box
| quote = "I played in teams who were dominant with the ball and loved it. I also played in teams who didn't have much of the ball and hated it.

I've tried to replicate that at the level I'm at and with the players I've had. If I didn't do that, I probably wouldn't have gone into coaching or management."
