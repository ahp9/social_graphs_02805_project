He completed his coaching badges with the [[Football Association of Wales]] and moved into management after retiring as a player.

Edwards managed Wolves' academy and had an interim spell at the first team, before leading [[AFC Telford United]] and the [[England national under-16 football team|England under-16 team]]. He guided [[Forest Green Rovers F.C.|Forest Green Rovers]] to promotion as [[EFL League Two|League Two champions]] in the [[2021–22 Forest Green Rovers F.C. season|2021–22 season]].
