'''Peter John Taylor''' (born 3 January 1953) is an English former [[Association football|footballer]], who was last manager of [[Canvey Island F.C.|Canvey Island]]. He was previously manager at [[Dartford F.C.|Dartford]], [[Enfield F.C.|Enfield]], [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]], [[Dover Athletic]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton and Hove Albion]], [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Kerala Blasters F.C.|Kerala Blasters]], [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage Borough]], [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and (twice) [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], [[Maldon & Tiptree F.C.|Maldon & Tiptree]]. He also had two spells as head coach of the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 team]] and took charge of the England national team as caretaker manager for one game against Italy, for which he made [[David Beckham]] captain of England for the first time. He managed the [[England national under-20 football team|England under-20]] team in 2013. Outside England, Taylor was the head coach of the [[Bahrain national football team]].

During his time as a player with Crystal Palace during the 1970s, Taylor became one of the few players to have been selected for the senior England team when not playing in the top two flights of a domestic league.

==Playing career==
Taylor enjoyed a successful playing career as a [[Left winger|winger]]. He began his youth career with [[Canvey Island F.C.|Canvey Island]],<ref>[http://www.englandfootballonline.com/teammgr/mgr_taylorp.html England Caretaker Manager – Peter Taylor].

However, Palace's season tailed off after the semi-final and they did not achieve promotion to the second tier. At the end of the season Allison resigned and was replaced by [[Terry Venables]], and on 30 September 1976<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Taylor was allowed to depart for top-flight Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of £400,000.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Taylor scored on his debut in a 4–2 defeat at [[The Hawthorns]] to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]. He had a mixed career at Spurs; the club suffered relegation in 1977 but was promoted in 1978. Taylor did not make another England appearance and in 1980 moved on to [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], having made 123 appearances for Tottenham during which he scored 31 times. He played 56 times for Orient, scoring eleven times in three seasons, and had a brief loan spell at [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]]. In 1983–84 Taylor made eight appearances for [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] before moving into [[non-league football]] with firstly [[Maidstone United F.C. (1897)|Maidstone United]], and then [[Chelmsford City F.C.|Chelmsford City]], [[Dartford F.C.|Dartford]]<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book|title=Crystal Palace: A Complete Record 1905–1989|author=Mike Purkiss & Nigel Sands|year=1990|page=89|isbn=0907969542}}</ref> and [[Enfield F.C.|Enfield]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenonleaguefootballpaper.com/latest-news/22992/dagenham-and-redbridge-announce-peter-taylor-and-terry-harris-as-new-management-team/|title=Dagenham and Redbridge announce Peter Taylor and Terry Harris as new management team|date=5 June 2018|work=The Non-League Football Paper\access-date=6 October 2019}}</ref>

Taylor made his England debut as a substitute versus [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and scored the winning goal in the 80th minute of that game. He scored his second international goal against the same opponents in the next match that he played.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/11/the-knowledge-questions-answered The Knowledge: Players returning to former clubs | Jacob Steinberg | Football].

After his playing career ended, Taylor embarked on a career as a coach and manager.

==Management career==

===Early management===
Taylor became player manager at [[non-league football|non-league]] club [[Dartford F.C.|Dartford]]. In his four seasons there, club attendances rose from 400 to around 1,000, he won the Southern Cup twice and each season he was there Dartford scored more than 100 goals. Taylor's first managerial role in the [[English Football League|Football League]] was at [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]]. He spent two years between 1993 and 1995 as manager but quit at the end of the [[1994-95 in English football|1994–95]] season after failing to get them beyond the middle of the [[Football League First Division|Division One]] table. Taylor took on the job as manager of [[Conference National|Conference]] club [[Dover Athletic F.C.|Dover Athletic]] in [[1995-96 in English football|1995–96]] season and guided the club to 20th, enough to stave off the threat of relegation as only two clubs were relegated that season.

===England U-21===
He agreed and signed a two-year contract at Dover in May 1996 but was to leave the club only two months later after being asked by then England boss [[Glenn Hoddle]] to manage the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] side. His record (for competitive matches) was eleven wins, three draws and one defeat from fifteen games. In this time, England finished ninth in [[UEFA U-21 Championship 1998|1998 European Championship]] and qualified for the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2000|2000 finals]] comfortably, winning every match without conceding a goal. But with three matches to play, Taylor was replaced in a controversial manner by [[Howard Wilkinson]], who won the next two matches. The three goals conceded in the 3–1 defeat to group runners-up [[Poland national under-21 football team|Poland]] were the only blemish on the team's qualifying record. England under Wilkinson later got knocked out in the group stage of the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2000|finals]], winning against Turkey but losing to Slovakia and champions Italy.

===Gillingham===
Taylor returned to club management at the beginning of the [[1999-2000 in English football|1999–2000]] season with [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], and at the end of the season guided them to victory over [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in the [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] play-off final which marked the [[Kent]] club's promotion to the upper half of the English league for the first time in their history. During this season he also guided the Gills to the quarterfinals of the FA Cup after impressive wins over Premiership opposition in Bradford City and Sheffield Wednesday (a brace of 3–1 home wins), before losing 5–0 away to Chelsea in the last eight.

===Leicester City===
A few weeks later he left the club to take charge at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in the [[Premier League]]. He had an excellent start at the [[East Midlands]] club and they went top of the league on 1 October 2000. They stayed at the top of the league for two weeks (Taylor having been voted [[Premier League Manager of the Month]] for September 2000) and were in contention for a [[UEFA Cup]] place for well over half a season, but nine defeats from their final ten games sucked them down to 13th place in the wake of a shock defeat by [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in the [[FA Cup]] quarter-final.<ref>Abrams, Jonny (17 December 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120313034107/http://blog.sport.co.uk/Football/524/Top_Ten_Premier_League_Surprise_Packages.aspx Top Ten: Premier League 'Surprise Packages']. sport.co.uk</ref>

After a terrible start to the [[2001-02 in English football|2001–02]] season, Taylor was sacked on 30 September 2001.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/taylor-is-sacked-by-leicester-671438.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220526/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/taylor-is-sacked-by-leicester-671438.html |archive-date=26 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Taylor is sacked by Leicester | first=Alan | last=Nixon | date=1 October 2001 | access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref>

====England====
In November 2000, whilst managing Leicester, Taylor was appointed caretaker manager of England for one match. For that game, a 1–0 defeat by [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the [[Stadio Delle Alpi]] in [[Turin]] on 15 November 2000, Taylor looked to youth. He handed [[David Beckham]] the [[Captain (association football)|captain]]'s armband for the first time and used six players then still eligible for the Under-21s; [[Gareth Barry]], [[Jamie Carragher]], [[Kieron Dyer]], [[Rio Ferdinand]], [[Emile Heskey]] and [[Seth Johnson (footballer)|Seth Johnson]].

===Brighton and Hove Albion===
After being sacked by Leicester, he returned to management within two weeks to take charge at [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] whose previous manager [[Micky Adams]] had become the new assistant manager of Leicester City. Taylor guided Brighton to the [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] championship (marking their return to the upper half of the English league after eleven years) but resigned from his job at the end of the season, citing a low budget and the delay to the new stadium.<ref>Davies, Christopher. (29 April 2002) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/league-one/3026847/Taylor-resigns-in-frustration-at-stadium-delay.html Taylor resigns in frustration at stadium delay]. ''The Daily Telegraph''. Retrieved 17 June 2016.</ref>

===Hull City===
In November 2002 Taylor was appointed manager of [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] who were weeks away from their move to the 25,404-seat [[KC Stadium]]. A mid-table finish was followed in [[2003-04 in English football|2003–04]] by promotion as [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] runners-up. They finished League One runners-up the following season, [[2004-05 in English football|2004–05]], and thus reached the [[Football League Championship]] in the [[2005-06 in English football|2005–06 season]] – their first appearance at that level since [[1990-91 in English football|1990–91]], and they finished 18th in the league.

===England U-21 (second spell)===
Taylor had returned to manage England's U-21 team for a second spell in 2004, combining the role with his job at Hull.
England comfortably progressed from their qualification group for the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2006|2006 finals]] but lost to eventual semi-finalists [[France national under-21 football team|France]] in a play-off over two legs. He initially retained his position after joining Crystal Palace, and the team qualified for the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2007|2007 finals]]. However, he left in January 2007 as the new senior manager, [[Steve McClaren]], wanted the England U-21 manager's role to be a full-time position. Taylor's record in competitive fixtures in his second spell with the U21s was nine wins, five draws and two defeats from sixteen games.

===Crystal Palace===
[[Image:PeterTaylor2009.jpg|thumb|Taylor on the sidelines as Dover Athletic manager.]]
Success at Hull drew attention from other clubs, and Taylor returned to former club Crystal Palace in June 2006 after Palace agreed a £300,000 compensation package with Hull. He only lasted sixteen months at [[Selhurst Park]] as he was sacked in October 2007 after a run of poor form left the Eagles hovering dangerously above the bottom three.<ref>{{cite news

On 28 April 2008, Taylor left Stevenage Borough after six months in charge when his short-term contract expired and he had failed to get them into the end of season play-offs. They finished the season in sixth place, 22 points behind the champions, having been in third place and just four points off top spot when he took charge.

===Wycombe Wanderers===
On 29 May 2008, he became [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] manager, following the resignation of [[Paul Lambert]] after their failure to reach the League Two play-off final.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wycombe_wanderers/7424474.stm|title= Wycombe name Taylor as new boss|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 May 2008|access-date=29 May 2008}}</ref> He signed [[Junior Lewis]], this time as first team coach.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wycombe_wanderers/7465506.stm|title= Wycombe bring in Lewis as coach|date=20 June 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=20 June 2008}}</ref> Taylor had a successful start to the 2008–09 season as Wycombe went on an 18-game unbeaten run in the league with promotion to League One being secured on the final day of the season.

===Bradford City===
On 16 February 2010, Taylor replaced [[Stuart McCall]] to become manager of League Two side [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], initially on a three-month contract until the end of the [[Bradford City A.F.C. season 2009–10|2009–10]] season. Junior Lewis was employed as first team coach, working with assistant manager [[Wayne Jacobs]] and youth team coach [[David Wetherall]].

===Bahrain===
On 11 July 2011, the [[Bahrain Football Association]] signed Taylor to train the national football team. Just a few months later he led Bahrain to winning the football tournament at the [[Football at the 2011 GCC Games|1st GCC Games]] in [[Manama]], the first time Bahrain's national team had won a regional competition in their history. Bahrain beat arch rivals Saudi Arabia 3–1 in a one-sided final. Taylor received a lot of praise from the players, fans and officials for his achievement.

Two months later, Taylor successfully led the Bahrainian team to clinch football gold in the [[2011 Arab Games]] in [[Doha]], beating Jordan 1–0 in the final with a last-gasp goal by striker Ismail Abdullatif.<ref>[http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/464756 Peter Taylor, new bahrain head coach].
