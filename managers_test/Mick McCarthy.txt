'''Michael Joseph McCarthy''' (born 7 February 1959) is a professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]], pundit and former [[Association football|footballer]]. He was most recently the head coach of [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]].

McCarthy began his playing career at [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] in 1977 as a central defender, and he later had spells at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], and finally [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], retiring in 1992. Born and raised in England, he represented the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], for whom he earned 57 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and played at [[UEFA Euro 1988]] and the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]].

McCarthy managed Millwall and then the Republic of Ireland. He guided the country to the knockout stage of the last 16 of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. He later managed [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. McCarthy began a second tenure as manager of the Republic of Ireland national team in November 2018, leaving after having guided the team to a [[UEFA Euro 2020]] playoff place. He then had brief spells at Cypriot club [[APOEL FC|APOEL]], [[Cardiff City]] and Blackpool. He has also been a television pundit and [[Sports commentator|commentator]], including for the [[BBC]] and [[Virgin Media Television (Ireland)|Virgin Media Television]].

==Club career==
===Barnsley===
Born in [[Barnsley]], West Riding of Yorkshire,<ref name=Hugman/> McCarthy made his league debut for then-Fourth Division [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on 20 August 1977 in a 4–0 win over [[Rochdale F.C.|Rochdale]]. He spent two years in the basement league, before the club won promotion. Two years later, the team again went up to the (old) Division 2. A strong central defender, he was a virtual ever-present for his home town club, but departed in December 1983 for fellow Division 2 club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].

===Manchester City===
McCarthy was signed by [[Billy McNeill]], himself a former centre-back, and was given the number 6 jersey.<ref>{{Cite web |title=BIg Mick: The Mick McCarthy Story |url=https://www.mancity.com/features/bigmickPART1 |access-date=2025-10-14 |website=www.mancity.com |language=en}}</ref> The [[Maine Road]] club won promotion in McCarthy's first full season and he finally had the chance to play at the highest level. His first season in the top flight was steady enough as the club reached mid-table, but relegation struck the following year. McCarthy himself would not face the drop though as he moved to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in May 1987.<ref>{{cite news |date=15 August 1987 |page=13 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29537305/the_guardian/ |title=Accent still on Merseyside |first=David |last=Lacey |via=[[Newspapers.com]]  |access-date= 15 March 2019}}{{free access}}</ref>

===Celtic===
He picked up his first silverware at the Scottish club as they won the league and cup double in his first season. The following season McCarthy again won a [[Scottish Cup]] winners medal,<ref name="IrishmanAbroad"/> although the club had to settle for third place in the league.<ref>{{cite web |website=Statto |title=Scottish Premier Division 1988–1989 : Table |url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/scotland/premier-division/1988-1989/table |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415232632/http://www.statto.com/football/stats/scotland/premier-division/1988-1989/table |url-status=live |archive-date=15 April 2013 |access-date=15 March 2019}}</ref>

===Lyon===
McCarthy again moved onto a new country, as he joined [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] on a three-year contract in July 1989.<ref name="IrishmanAbroad">{{cite podcast |author-link=Jarlath Regan |author=Jarlath Regan |edition=225 |work=[[An Irishman Abroad]] |title=Mick McCarthy |publisher=[[SoundCloud]] |date=6 January 2018 |url=https://soundcloud.com/an-irishman-abroad/mick-mccarthy-episode-225 |access-date=12 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.the42.ie/mick-mccarthy-lyon-4480685-Feb2019/ |title = Remembering Mick McCarthy's brief and forgotten spell with Lyon |date=7 February 2019 |website=[[The42.ie]] |access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref>	

===Millwall===
McCarthy returned to England on loan with top-flight [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in March 1990.<ref name="IrishmanAbroad"/> He signed permanently in May 1990 for £200,000. His appearances in the next two seasons were often limited by injuries and he effectively retired from playing when he took over as manager of the club in 1992.<ref name="voicemail">{{cite news |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Robert |last=Pryce |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29538617/the_guardian/ |title=Soccer Diary |date=21 March 1992 |page=18 |access-date=15 March 2019}}</ref>

==International career==
McCarthy, the son of an Irish-born father, Charlie, is an Irish citizen since birth.<ref name="7-1">Section 7(1) of the ''Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004''.</ref> He made his Irish international debut in a goalless friendly against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] on 23 May 1984, McCarthy soon became a first-choice player and featured in all three of Ireland's games at [[UEFA Euro 1988]]. He went on to become captain, leading to the nickname "Captain Fantastic", as per the title of his autobiography.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29537577/the_tampa_tribune/   |date=6 January 1992 |first=Bill |last=Chastain |title=Commentary |page=103 |work=[[The Tampa Tribune]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=15 March 2019}}{{free access}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/23/mick-mccarthy-jack-charlton-illuminated-ireland-changed-lives |title =Mick McCarthy on Jack Charlton: 'He illuminated Ireland and changed lives'|date= 23 September 2020 |work=Guardian|access-date=24 September 2020}}</ref>	

The highlight of McCarthy's international career was the second-round penalty shoot-out win over [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] finals. This led to a crunch tie with hosts [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the quarter-final, where Ireland's first ever appearance in the finals came to an end, losing 1–0. McCarthy was the player who committed the most fouls in the 1990 tournament.<ref name="voicemail"/>

In total, McCarthy won 57 caps for the Republic of Ireland; scoring two goals, one against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in April 1988,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerscene.ie/ss_gen/matchdetails.php?id=238&level=sssenior|title=Statistics: Republic of Ireland [Powered by tplSoccerStats]|website=www.soccerscene.ie|access-date=17 March 2019}}</ref> the other against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] in May 1992.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29538200/the_akron_beacon_journal/ |work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]] |title=Soccer: U.S. an upset winner over Ireland |date=31 May 1992 |page=125 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=15 March 2019}}{{free access}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
===Millwall===
McCarthy became player-manager at [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in March 1992, succeeding [[Bruce Rioch]]. In his first full season (1992–93), he was still registered as a player, but made only one further appearance (in the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]]), before he became solely a manager.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

He took the club to the play-offs in 1993–94 after a strong third-place finish, but they lost out to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in the semi-finals. During the 1995–96 season, McCarthy became the prime candidate for the vacant [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] manager's job, after the resignation of [[Jack Charlton]]. After a protracted period of speculation, McCarthy was officially appointed on 5 February 1996, two days after his resignation at the club. Despite sitting a comfortable 14 points clear from the relegation zone at the time of his departure, Millwall would go on to suffer the drop (by virtue of goals scored) after McCarthy's departure.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

His loan signings of the underachieving [[Russia]]n internationals [[Sergei Yuran]] and [[Vassili Kulkov]] from [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]], who each received a £150,000 signing-on fee and were being paid five times the wage of the rest of the first team, would later be cited {{by whom|date=November 2018}} as one of the main reasons Millwall were eventually relegated under [[Jimmy Nicholl]], although it cannot be proven.<ref name="Bethel">Bethel, Chris; ''Millwall Football Club 1940–2001'' Tempus Publishing Ltd, 2001, p.122; {{ISBN|0-7524-2187-5}}</ref>

===Republic of Ireland===
In February 1996, McCarthy became the new manager of the Republic of Ireland football team following the resignation of [[Jack Charlton]]. His first game in charge was a friendly international against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] on 27 March which finished in a 0–2 defeat.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Rob|date=19 March 2019|title=Where are they now? Mick McCarthy's first Ireland XI|website=[[RTÉ.ie]] |url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2019/0319/1037350-where-are-they-now-mick-mccarthys-first-ireland-xi/|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>

After two narrow failures to qualify for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], McCarthy took the nation to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] held in South Korea and Japan after a 2–1 [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification|play-off]] aggregate win against [[Iran national football team|Iran]].<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/nov/15/minutebyminute.sport|title= Iran 1 – 0 Ireland (agg: 1 – 2)|date=15 November 2001|work=The Guardian |access-date=18 October 2013}}</ref> Before the tournament, McCarthy was involved in a very public and bitter [[Saipan incident|spat]] with star player [[Roy Keane]], who was sent home the day before it began. The conflict occurred after Keane had questioned the quality of the preparations and facilities the team were using.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/rep_of_ireland/newsid_2012000/2012137.stm |title=Keane v McCarthy: blow-by-blow|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date= 28 May 2002 |access-date= 19 August 2009}}</ref>

Despite this furore, McCarthy's team reached the second round but were eliminated by [[Spain men's national football team|Spain]] in a [[kicks from the penalty mark|penalty shoot-out]] (after having already missed and scored a penalty in normal time). In spite of this, the Keane issue remained, with the proportion of blame undecided. Many in Ireland sided with Keane – particularly following a televised interview in which details of poor preparation were revealed – and demanded McCarthy's resignation both during and after the tournament. An independent inquiry into the organisation's handling of the squad's preparation later commissioned by the [[Football Association of Ireland]] created a damning report, leading to general secretary Brendan Menton tendering his resignation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2002/1112/fai.html |title=Menton quits following damning FAI report| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209003252/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2002/1112/fai.html |archive-date=9 December 2008 |work=[[RTÉ]].ie|date= 12 November 2002 |access-date= 19 August 2009}}</ref>

Criticism of McCarthy in the media became increasingly intense after a poor start to Ireland's [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying Group 10|qualifying]] campaign for [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]]. In particular, his persistence with several players and tactics that some perceived to be inadequate did him damage, as did a 4–2 away defeat to [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and a 2–1 home defeat to [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. Under mounting pressure, McCarthy resigned from the post on 5 November 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/republic_of_ireland/2406549.stm |title=McCarthy quits Republic|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date= 6 November 2002 |access-date= 19 August 2009}}</ref> During his 68 games in charge, the Republic of Ireland won 29, drew 20 and lost 19.<ref name="ROI">{{cite web|url = http://www.soccer-ireland.com/irish-soccer-managers/mick-mccarthy.htm|title=Mick McCarthy – Irish Soccer Manager|publisher=Soccer Ireland|access-date=22 January 2016}}</ref>

===Sunderland===
On 12 March 2003, McCarthy was appointed manager of struggling [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] as an immediate replacement for [[Howard Wilkinson]], who was sacked after six successive [[Premier League|Premiership]] defeats left the club facing near-certain relegation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/2838747.stm |title=McCarthy unveiled as Sunderland boss |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date= 12 March 2003 |access-date= 19 August 2009}}</ref> The following season, after relegation, he took Sunderland to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] promotion play-offs, but lost in a penalty shoot-out to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] after Palace had scored a stoppage-time equaliser.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sunderland 2–1 C Palace |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/3710227.stm |access-date=22 November 2021 |date=17 May 2004}}</ref>

McCarthy completed the turnaround of the club in the [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]] season. The Black Cats returned to the Premier League as Football League Championship champions, amassing 94 points.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/mick-out-1-1106073|title=MICK OUT|date=6 March 2006|work=[[Sunderland Echo]]|access-date=29 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629074257/https://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/mick-out-1-1106073|archive-date=29 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> After a poor season and with the club 16 points from safety with only 10 games remaining, he was dismissed on 6 March 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/4778496.stm |title=Sunderland sack manager McCarthy |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date= 6 March 2006 |access-date= 19 August 2009}}</ref>

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
[[File:Mick McCarthy Wolverhampton Wanderers Manager.jpg|thumb|right|McCarthy as [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] manager in 2011]]
On 21 July 2006, McCarthy was appointed manager at Championship side [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], replacing [[Glenn Hoddle]] who had resigned a fortnight earlier. He signed a 12-month rolling contract<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/5202552.stm |title=McCarthy named new Wolves manager|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date= 21 July 2006 |access-date= 19 August 2009}}</ref> The team managed to make the promotion play-offs in his first season, where they lost out to local rivals [[West Bromwich Albion]] over two legs, losing 3–2 at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]] and 1–0 at [[The Hawthorns]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=McNulty |first1=Phil |title=West Brom 1–0 Wolves |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/6649727.stm |access-date=22 November 2021 |work=BBC Sport |date=16 May 2007}}</ref>

In the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08 season]] he took the club to within a single placing of a successive play-off finish, ending seventh, losing the coveted sixth place to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] by a goal difference of only one.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jolly |first1=Richard |title=Blackpool 1–1 Watford |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/04/blackpool.watford |access-date=22 November 2021 |work=The Guardian |date=4 May 2008}}</ref> The campaign had also seen him linked with the international positions of [[Korea Republic National Football Team|South Korea]] and his previous post as Republic of Ireland manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7128801.stm |title=McCarthy rules out Korea position |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=5 December 2007 |access-date= 19 August 2009}}</ref>

The [[2008-09 in English football|2008–09 season]] started well for McCarthy as he won the August [[Football League Championship Manager of the Month|Championship Manager of the Month Award]], after seeing his side reach the top of the table,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/7598391.stm |title=Wolves boss scoops monthly award |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=4 September 2008 |access-date= 19 August 2009}}</ref> eventually going on to match Wolves' record start to a season (equaling the 1949–50 season). Wolves maintained their position at the top of the table over the following months, and McCarthy again won the Manager of the Month Award for November.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/7765134.stm |title=McCarthy is top Championship boss |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=4 December 2008 |access-date= 19 August 2009}}</ref> After maintaining top spot since October, McCarthy's Wolves secured promotion to the Premier League by beating [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] 1–0 on 18 April 2009. The following week McCarthy clinched his second Championship as a manager after a 1–1 draw at his hometown club [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. He won the Championship Manager of the Season Award at the conclusion of the campaign, his side having led the table for 42 of 46 games.

The following season, McCarthy kept Wolves in the Premier League, his first success at this level in three attempts. The club assured safety with two games to spare, eventually finishing 15th, their best league finish since 1979–80, and their first ever survival in the modern Premier League. However, in the process of keeping the team in the top division, Wolves and McCarthy were fined £25,000 for fielding a weakened team for a fixture at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and thus breaking the Premier League rule E20. The Premier League also stated that the club had failed to fulfil its obligations to the league and other clubs in the utmost good faith and was therefore in breach of Rule B13.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wolves fined £25,000 over Old Trafford team selection |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/8521603.stm |access-date=1 September 2020 |work=BBC Sport |date=18 February 2010}}</ref>

The team spent the majority of the 2010–11 campaign mired in the relegation zone, yet managed to defeat the likes of [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9135951.stm|title=Wolverhampton 2–1 Man City| date=30 October 2010|work=BBC Sport|access-date=12 April 2012}}</ref> [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9384148.stm|title= Wolverhampton 2–1 Man Utd| date=5 February 2011|work=BBC Sport|access-date=13 February 2012}}</ref> [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9308904.stm|title= Liverpool 0–1 Wolverhampton| date=29 December 2010|work=BBC Sport|access-date=13 February 2012}}</ref> and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9334680.stm|title=Wolverhampton 0–1 Chelsea| date=5 January 2011|work=BBC Sport|access-date=13 February 2012}}</ref> A final day loss to Blackburn put them in danger of relegation, but results elsewhere meant they narrowly survived in 17th place, one point ahead of relegated [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham]] and [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9492248.stm|title=Premier League D-Day as it happened| date=22 May 2011|work=BBC Sport|first=Sam|last=Lyon|access-date=13 February 2012}}</ref> This gave McCarthy the distinction of being the first Wolves manager in thirty years to maintain the club's top flight position for two successive seasons.

The 2011–12 season began well for McCarthy and, after three games, his team topped the Premier League with 7 points.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/14520311.stm|title=Wolverhampton 2–0 Fulham| date=21 August 2011|work=BBC Sport|access-date=13 February 2012}}</ref> However, results tailed off and by January they had once again entered the relegation zone after nine games without victory. That same season Wolves sold £15&nbsp;million worth of players and with the board allowing McCarthy to spend just £12&nbsp;million it seemed inevitable when McCarthy was sacked as Wolves manager on 13 February 2012<ref name="BBC 17012933">{{cite news|title=Wolves sack manager Mick McCarthy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17012933|access-date=13 February 2012|work=BBC News|date=13 February 2012}}</ref> after a run of poor results, culminating in a 5–1 home defeat to [[Black Country derby|local rivals]] [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29539124/the_province/ |title=Wolves fire coach |work=[[The Province]] |date=14 February 2012 |page=31 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]|access-date=15 March 2019}}{{free access}}</ref> The club was relegated at the end of the season with three games to spare.

===Ipswich Town===
[[File:Mick McCarthy.jpg|thumb|right|McCarthy managing [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in 2016]]
On 1 November 2012, McCarthy was appointed manager at [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]<ref name="Mick McCarthy: Ipswich Town appoint ex-Wolves boss"/> on a two-and-a-half-year contract.<ref name="Mick McCarthy: Ipswich Town appoint ex-Wolves boss">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20153642 |title=Mick McCarthy: Ipswich Town appoint ex-Wolves boss|work= BBC Sport|date= 1 November 2012|access-date= 22 January 2016}}</ref> McCarthy's appointment came in the wake of [[Paul Jewell]]'s departure by mutual consent. McCarthy won his first match in charge as Ipswich manager on 3 November 2012, away at Birmingham, 0–1.

In June 2019, the national team drew 1–1 away to [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], before defeating Gibraltar once again, this time by 2–0, at the [[Aviva Stadium]]; four days later, McCarthy guided them to the top the Group D table, having taken ten points after four games.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.the42.ie/ireland-gibraltar-report-june-2019-4676366-Jun2019/|title =Brady's late header adds gloss to uninspiring Ireland win over Gibraltar|date=10 June 2019|work=The 42|access-date=11 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.the42.ie/mick-mccarthy-tv-reaction-copenhagen-4673182-Jun2019/|title =McCarthy pays tribute to 'fabulous' Duffy as Ireland snatch a point in Copenhagen|date=7 June 2019|work=The 42|access-date=11 June 2019}}</ref>

A 1–1 draw saw the Irish needing to win the play-offs to qualify. On 4 April 2020, amid the global [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]], McCarthy stood down as manager and was immediately replaced by [[Stephen Kenny (football manager)|Stephen Kenny]], who had been in charge of the nation's [[Republic of Ireland national under-21 football team|under-21s]], for the play-offs.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52168274|title=Republic of Ireland: Stephen Kenny to replace Mick McCarthy as manager|work=BBC Sport |access-date=4 April 2020}}</ref>

He signed a contract until the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/breaking-cardiff-manager-mick-mccarthy-19683218 |title=Cardiff City confirm Mick McCarthy as new manager until the end of the season |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |last=Williams |first=Glen |date=22 January 2021 |access-date=23 January 2021}}</ref> His reign started with games against two of his former teams from his playing-days; Barnsley and Millwall – both of which ended as draws.

Despite losing just one of their opening six matches at the start of the following season, a poor run of results followed which saw Cardiff drop as low as 21st in the table. On 23 October 2021, after suffering a club-record eighth successive loss of the season at the hands of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], McCarthy left the club by mutual consent.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/58946947|title=McCarthy leaves Cardiff after Boro loss|work=BBC Sport }}</ref>

He achieved two wins in his 14 games in charge, losing nine of them, which left the club second-bottom (where they were when he took over). "With results on the pitch not improving in recent weeks, the decision has been agreed by both parties that a change is needed," the club said in a statement.<ref>{{cite web |last=FC |first=Blackpool |title=Club Statement {{!}} Mick McCarthy |url=https://blackpoolfc.co.uk/news/2023/april/08/club-statement---mick-mccarthy/ |access-date=8 April 2023 |website=Blackpool FC |date=8 April 2023 }}</ref>
