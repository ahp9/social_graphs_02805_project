As a player, he was a [[midfielder]] from 1987 until 2005, notably as [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]' [[Premier League]] title-winning side in 1995.

As one of [[Kenny Dalglish]]'s first signings for Blackburn, he initially struggled to make the first team but went on to become a core player. Under his captaincy, Blackburn finished second in the Premiership in [[1993-94 in English football|1993–94]] before winning it the following season.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
With Sherwood unsettled in 1999 and having family and business links in [[Hertfordshire]], [[George Graham (footballer, born 1944)|George Graham]] paid a reported fee of £3 million to bring him to Tottenham Hotspur in the first week of February 1999.
