'''Joseph Royle''' (born 8 April 1949) is an English [[association football|football]] manager and former footballer. In his playing career as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]], he debuted for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at the age of 16 and went on to play for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], and the [[England national football team|England national team]]. Later, he managed [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], Everton, Manchester City, and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. He is a director at [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Geldard |first=Suzanne |title=Joe Royle returns to Oldham Athletic following club takeover |work=Oldham Times |url=https://www.theoldhamtimes.co.uk/sport/20586764.joe-royle-returns-oldham-athletic-following-club-takeover/}}</ref>

==Playing career==
===Club career===
Royle was born in the [[Norris Green]] area of [[Liverpool]] on 8 April 1949. He attended Ranworth Square Primary School in Norris Green and [[Quarry Bank High School]] in Liverpool's [[Allerton, Liverpool|Allerton]] suburb, where he was an all-round sportsman. Unusually for a grammar schoolboy, he played for the Liverpool schoolboys team, which was usually drawn from secondary modern schools.

A number of clubs were interested in signing Royle, including [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], but it was his hometown club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] that succeeded in recruiting him to their ranks. He went on to make 270 appearances for Everton, scoring 119 times. He made his debut at the age of 16 and held the record of being the youngest player to play for Everton until [[James Vaughan (striker)|James Vaughan]] beat the record on 10 April 2005 by 11 days. For five seasons he was Everton's top scorer, notably scoring 23 goals in the Championship-winning side of [[1969–70 in English football|1969–70]]. [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager [[Tony Book]] bought Royle for £170,000 in 1974 and he went on to claim further honours as he helped them to win the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 1976.

He left [[Maine Road]] in November 1977 to join [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and had a further stint with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], including winning [[Norwich City player of the year]] in 1981, before being forced to retire from the game in 1982 (aged 33) due to a knee injury. In 2002, he was voted into the club's [[Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame|hall of fame]] by Norwich supporters. His time at Bristol City, however, had not been so fruitful. After a storming on-loan debut, scoring four, he only tallied another 14 goals in the remaining 100 games with them.

===International career===
Royle was awarded the first of his six England caps against [[Malta national football team|Malta]] in 1971.

== Managerial career ==
===Oldham Athletic===
In June 1982, Royle moved into management in the Second Division at [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]]. He spent more than 12 years in charge at [[Boundary Park]], taking them into the First Division in 1991 (a year before it became the [[FA Premier League]]) as Second Division champions. Royle's teams won many friends with their cavalier style of play, which was particularly evident during the season that they played on artificial turf on their home ground. Oldham reached a cup final for the first time in 1990 when they reached the final of the [[League Cup]], but they were beaten 1–0 by [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. They also reached the FA Cup semi-finals that season, and held [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] to a 3–3 draw in the first match at [[Maine Road]] before losing the replay 2–1.

When [[England national football team]] manager [[Bobby Robson]] announced in May 1990 that he would be quitting the job after the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] that summer, Royle's name was strongly linked with the role and [[the Football Association]] shortlisted him along with [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] and [[Howard Kendall]]. This was despite Royle having yet to manage in the First Division; whereas in contrast Kendall had won two league titles, an FA Cup and [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] with Everton, and Taylor had taken both [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] to runners-up spot in the top flight and Watford to an FA Cup [[1984 FA Cup Final|final]]. Incredibly, Royle was selected on the shortlist ahead of [[Terry Venables]], the [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] manager whose managerial CV included taking [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] to the Spanish [[La Liga|league title]] and to a [[European Cup]] final, as well as guiding [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|Queen's Park Rangers]] to an FA Cup final in [[1982 FA Cup Final|1982]]. Venables himself had expressed interest in the job&nbsp;– which would finally become his in January 1994. In the event, Graham Taylor was appointed as England's new manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/teammgr/Mgr_TaylorG.html|title=England Managers - Graham Taylor|website=www.englandfootballonline.com}}</ref>

In 1991, Oldham finished champions of the Second Division, and were promoted to the First Division where they had last played 68 years earlier.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.oldhamathletic.co.uk/news/2017/april/on-this-day-april-27-1991/ |title=On this Day: April 27, 1991 |website=Oldham Athletic AFC |date=27 April 2017 |access-date=10 February 2023}}</ref>

Royle was able to attract established stars to Oldham, as well as developing talent which would go on to excel at a higher level. These included striker [[Graeme Sharp]] – one of the most accomplished goalscorers of the past decade&nbsp;– who was signed from Everton in 1991,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.efchistory.co.uk/Graeme%20Sharp.htm |title=Graeme Sharp |access-date=13 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930090055/http://www.efchistory.co.uk/Graeme%20Sharp.htm |archive-date=30 September 2011}}</ref> midfielder [[Mike Milligan (footballer)|Mike Milligan]] (who was sold to Everton for £1million in 1990 and signed back for £600,000 a year later),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonresults.com/MilliganM.htm|title=Everton Results|website=www.evertonresults.com}}</ref> left back [[Earl Barrett]] (who was one of the most expensive defenders in England when he was sold to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for £1.7million in early 1992)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldhamathletic.co.uk/page/Facts |title=Oldham Athletic &#124; Club &#124; Facts &#124; FACTS |access-date=13 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210201009/http://www.oldhamathletic.co.uk/page/Facts |archive-date=10 December 2011}}</ref> and right-back [[Denis Irwin]], who was signed on a free transfer from [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in 1986 and was sold to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for £625,000 in 1990, where he went on to win numerous domestic and European honours over the next 12 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccer-ireland.com/manchester-united/denis-irwin.htm|title=Denis Irwin : Manchester United : Irish Footballer : Cork|website=www.soccer-ireland.com|date=3 January 2023 |last1=Com |first1=Soccer-Ireland }}</ref>

The Latics finished 17th in [[1991-92 in English football|1991–92 season]] – their first top flight campaign for almost 70 years&nbsp;– and secured their place in the new Premier League. A key game which helped ensure survival was a 5–1 home win over eventually relegated [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], in which Graeme Sharp scored four goals. They also hosted Manchester United on Boxing Day 1991, and went down 6–3 in one of the most thrilling league contests of the season.

They survived on goal difference on the last day of the [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93]] with a remarkable 4–3 home win over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], their survival also boosted by an earlier 1–0 away win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] – a victory which handed the title to Oldham's local rivals [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/02/5 |title=The Joy of Six: great escapes |author=Rob Smyth |work=The Guardian |date=2 May 2008 |access-date=10 February 2023}}</ref> This result sent [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] down instead.

However, [[1993-94 in English football|1993–94]] brought another battle against relegation and this time the Latics were unable to win it. They were rarely outside the bottom three all season. Another away win over Southampton at the end of March 1994 lifted the Latics out of the relegation zone<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldhamathletic-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=30&Month=Mar&ssnno=123&teamno=404|title=Oldham Athletic Sky Bet League One 2017/2018 - Footymad|first=Digital Sports Group|last=LTD|website=www.oldhamathletic-mad.co.uk}}</ref> and a 4–1 home win over [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] in the next game put them three points clear of the drop zone with two games in hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldhamathletic-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=02&Month=Apr&ssnno=123&teamno=404|title=Oldham Athletic Sky Bet League One 2017/2018 - Footymad|first=Digital Sports Group|last=LTD|website=www.oldhamathletic-mad.co.uk}}</ref> However, a late Manchester United equaliser put their FA Cup dream on ice in the Wembley semi-final and they were defeated 4–1 three days later in the [[Maine Road]] replay.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-fa-cup-semifinal-replay-imperious-robson-sweeps-united-down-wembley-way-kanchelskis-helps-set-up-final-with-chelsea-1370046.html |title=Football / FA Cup Semi-Final Replay: Imperious Robson sweeps United down Wembley way: Kanchelskis helps set up final with Chelsea |author=Joe Lovejoy |work=The Independent |date=13 April 1994 |access-date=10 February 2023}}</ref> The Premier League campaign had already brought two thrilling matches between Oldham and their bigger local rivals - a 5–2 win for United at Boundary Park just after Christmas, and at the beginning of April the return match at [[Old Trafford]] saw the hosts win a closely-fought game 3–2.

The Latics failed to win any of their final eight games and a 1–1 draw at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on the final day of the season was not enough to stave off relegation. Royle remained in charge of Oldham despite their relegation, and oversaw their first few months in Division One.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldhamathletic-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadtmrs.asp?ssnno=123&teamno=404 |title=Fixtures/Results - Oldham Athletic FC - Latics Mad |website=www.oldhamathletic-mad.co.uk |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007114535/http://www.oldhamathletic-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadtmrs.asp?ssnno=123&teamno=404 |archive-date=7 October 2011}} </ref>

===Everton===
After 12 years of managing Oldham, Royle returned to Everton in November 1994 to succeed manager [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]], who had been sacked after less than a year in charge following Everton's worst start to a league season, with no wins from their first 12 league games. He permanently signed Scottish striker [[Duncan Ferguson]], who was at Everton on loan. Ferguson would go on to play a big part in Everton's success after Royle's arrival, and would remain loyal to the team after retiring as a player in 2006 (taking a position as a trainer at Everton and even having an interim spell as manager in the [[2019–20 Premier League|2019–20 season]] when he took over as temporary manager for three games before the arrival of [[Carlo Ancelotti]]).

Everton's league form improved under Royle, and they achieved Premier League survival at the beginning of May, finally achieving a 15th-place finish. After defeating [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] 4–1 in the [[FA Cup]] semi-final, they went on to beat [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 1–0 in [[1995 FA Cup Final|the final]], which remains their most recent major trophy to date.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.evertonfc.com/news/1654270/on-this-day-all-about-the-1995-cup-semi-final |title=On This Day: All About The 1995 Cup Semi-Final |author=Darren Griffiths |publisher=Everton FC |date=9 April 2020 |access-date=10 February 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11991234/evertons-25-years-without-silverware-no-luck-little-money-and-lack-of-belief-but-carlo-ancelotti-can-turn-around-fortunes |title=Everton's 25 years without silverware: No luck, little money and lack of belief... but Carlo Ancelotti can turn around fortunes |author=Julian Warren |publisher=Sky Sports |date=12 June 2020 |access-date=10 February 2023}}</ref>

That summer, Royle signed Manchester United's top scorer [[Andrei Kanchelskis]] for a club record £5 million, and Everton progressed further in [[1995-96 in English football|1995–96]] as they finished sixth in the league, although they only reached the second round of the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], their first European campaign for 11 years. He then signed winger [[Gary Speed]] from [[Leeds United]] for £3.5 million in the summer of 1996, and paid a club record £5.75 million for [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] forward [[Nick Barmby]] later in 1996, but Everton's form in [[1996-97 in English football|1996–97]] was less convincing and on transfer deadline day in 1997 he was not permitted to sign Norwegians [[Tore André Flo]] and [[Claus Eftevaag]] by chairman [[Peter Johnson (businessman)|Peter Johnson]], which led to his resignation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/everton/10791377/Evertons-defeat-by-Southampton-shows-the-size-of-the-summer-task-now-facing-manager-Roberto-Martinez.html|title=Everton's defeat by Southampton shows the size of the summer task now facing manager Roberto Martínez|date=27 April 2014 }}</ref> Everton were just four points above the relegation zone when Royle resigned, their form having dipped since the sale of Andrei Kanchelskis to [[Fiorentina]] two months earlier.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/content/history/players-and-managers/managers/joe-royle |title=Joe Royle &#124; Everton Football Club |access-date=7 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190507221241/http://www.evertonfc.com/content/history/players-and-managers/managers/joe-royle |archive-date=7 May 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Royle was named an Everton Giant in 2004 for his successes as both a player and a manager for the team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/10172/joe-royle.html|title=Everton FC - Undergoing Maintenance|website=www.evertonfc.com|access-date=17 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527071959/http://www.evertonfc.com/history/10172/joe-royle.html|archive-date=27 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Manchester City===
After 11 months out of the game, he accepted the challenge to manage Manchester City in February 1998. When Royle arrived the club was battling against relegation from Division One. They won their final game of the season 5–2 away to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], but both teams were relegated due to the other three relegation-threatened teams all winning. Royle's services were retained and he delivered an instant promotion the following season, as City beat [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] on penalties in the [[1999 Football League Second Division play-off final|1999 Division Two play-off final]] after drawing 2–2 in open play.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/02/manchester-united-treble-city-third-tier-may-1999-late-goals|title=When Manchester City escaped the third tier – as United won the treble|date=1 June 2023|work=Guardian|accessdate=2 June 2023}}</ref>
A year later, he delivered City a second successive promotion as they finished runners-up in Division One and clinched a place in the Premier League on the final day of the league season. However, City were relegated straight back to Division One and Royle was sacked in May 2001.<ref>{{cite news

===Ipswich Town===
After more than a year out of the game, Royle returned to football in October 2002 to manage [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], who had been relegated from the Premier League the previous season and had dismissed long-serving manager [[George Burley]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ipswich role for Royle |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/018a-0e6a5057d2e9-8aba9512f8d4-1000--ipswich-role-for-royle/ |access-date=26 February 2021 |publisher=UEFA |date=28 October 2002}}</ref> From February to May 2003 the club was in [[Administration (law)|administration]], which led to the exit of several key players and a restriction of transfer and wage funds.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ipswich exit administration |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/2950192.stm |access-date=26 February 2021 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 May 2003}}</ref> Royle twice led Ipswich to the play-offs, in 2004 and 2005, but lost on both occasions to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the semi-finals. Several players were subsequently sold off to Premier League sides, and Ipswich finished 15th in the [[2005-06 in English football|2005–06]] season, their lowest finish since 1966, and Royle left the club by mutual consent.<ref>{{cite news |last1=James |first1=Stuart |title=Royle's reign ends after Ipswich's failure to justify pre-season hype |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/may/12/newsstory.sport2 |access-date=26 February 2021 |work=The Guardian |date=12 May 2006}}</ref>

===Later career===
In December 2006, Royle was appointed as a Patron of [[Trust Oldham]], the official supporter's association of [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]]. In November 2007, Royle was under serious consideration for the [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] managerial roles, but decided to pull out of the running for both.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=A1YourView&xml=/sport/2007/11/14/sfnwig114.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Wigan hope to gain Joe Royle's approval | first=Neil | last=Johnston | date=14 November 2007 | access-date=6 May 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

During his break from management, Royle co-commentated alongside the likes of John Helm and Tony Jones on [[Five (TV channel)|Five]]'s UEFA Cup Football coverage.

On 15 March 2009, Royle was re-appointed to Oldham Athletic on a temporary basis, following the resignation of [[John Sheridan (footballer)|John Sheridan]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/o/oldham_athletic/7945172.stm| title=Royle replaces Sheridan at Oldham| publisher=BBC Sport| date=15 March 2009| access-date=2 May 2009}}</ref> In April, he was offered the job on a permanent basis,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11730_5195706,00.html| title=Royle offered Latics job| publisher=Sky Sports| date=16 April 2009| access-date=2 May 2009}}</ref> but turned it down on 28 April, and announced that he would be leaving the club after the final game.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/o/oldham_athletic/8022275.stm| title=Manager Royle set to leave Oldham| publisher=BBC Sport| date=28 April 2009| access-date=2 May 2009}}</ref> On 2 May, in his final game, and the club's final game of the season, Royle led Oldham to a 2–1 away victory at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_2/8014947.stm| title=Walsall 1–2 Oldham| publisher=BBC Sport| date=2 May 2009| access-date=2 May 2009}}</ref>

On 2 June 2014, Royle joined [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] as a footballing consultant to new manager [[Neil Adams (footballer)|Neil Adams]]. On 14 July of the same year, Royle was appointed to help oversee the youth development at Everton, alongside [[David Unsworth]]. On 12 May 2016, following the departure of [[Roberto Martinez]], Royle assisted Unsworth in taking charge of Everton's final game of the season against Norwich.<ref>{{cite news |first=Phil |last=Kirkbride |title=Everton confirm temporary management team |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/david-unsworth-joe-royle-take-11325854 |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=12 May 2016 |access-date=15 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Eleanor |last=Crooks |title=Unsworth on pride at managing Everton FC, Martinez and wanting the job full time |url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/unsworth-pride-managing-everton-fc-11330443 |newspaper=Daily Post |date=13 May 2016 |access-date=15 May 2016}}</ref>
