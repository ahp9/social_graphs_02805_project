'''David John Pleat''' (born 15 January 1945) is an English [[association football|football]] player turned [[manager (association football)|manager]], and sports commentator. Pleat made 185 Football League appearances for five clubs, scoring 26 goals. He had two spells as manager of [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], and four as manager of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] (three of which were as caretaker manager).

==Early life==
Pleat was born in [[Nottingham]], England, and is of Jewish descent.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thejc.com/comment/opinion/nobel-winners-i-d-rather-have-a-jewish-premiership-footballer-1.50210|title=Nobel winners?

== Playing career==
As a winger, Pleat represented England at schoolboy and youth international level. He began his playing career with his hometown club [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. In February 1962, he made his debut as the youngest ever player for the club at the time aged 17 years and 33 days against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in Division 1. His goal in a 2–1 win over the Bluebirds that day remains the youngest by a debutant for Nottingham Forest.<ref>{{cite web |title=David Pleat - Players - The Posh Supporters Trust |url=https://www.theposhtrust.co.uk/player/david-pleat |access-date=2023-02-08 |website=www.theposhtrust.co.uk}}</ref> 

Injuries hampered his career and after spells at Luton Town (1964–67), [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] (1967–68) and [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] (1968–70) and [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] (1970–71), he turned to coaching and management,<ref name="NST1">{{cite news|title=Pleat's Ready To Bury Jinx|work=[[New Straits Times]]|date=15 May 1987}}</ref> having already qualified as a Full Badge FA Coach in 1968 when he was just 23.

==Managerial career==

===Nuneaton Borough===
His first coaching position was for Southern League team [[Nuneaton Town F.C.|Nuneaton Borough]]<ref name=NST1 /> in 1971,<ref name="Shaw">{{cite news |author=Phil Shaw |date=5 October 1998 |title=Football: Pleat lays foundations for Graham |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-pleat-lays-foundations-for-graham-1176352.html}}</ref> where he was appointed as player-manager on the recommendation of [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]], who worked alongside [[Brian Clough]] at Derby County and Nottingham Forest, and stayed there for two and a half seasons.

===Luton Town===
:{{see also|History of Luton Town F.C. (1970–present)}}
From there he joined the coaching staff at Luton Town, initially as reserve team coach. In January 1978 he was appointed manager of the club. During his eight years as manager of Luton Town the side were promoted from the [[Football League Second Division]] to the First Division, winning the second tier by a record number of points, and gained a reputation for playing attacking and attractive football, peaking at ninth place in the top flight in 1986. Although the highest position in the club's history was achieved in 1986/87 after Pleat had left (but with a team largely made up of Pleat's players) when Luton finished 7th in the old division one. A number of players in Pleat's team would receive international recognition, including defender [[Mal Donaghy]] (Northern Ireland), midfielder [[Ricky Hill]] and forwards [[Brian Stein]], [[Paul Walsh]] and [[Mick Harford]] (all England).

In 1983, Luton came close to being relegated from [[Football League First Division|Division One]], but reached safety after a late goal by [[Radomir Antić]] against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in the final game of the season.<ref name=Barclay>{{cite news|title=Pleat's soft-shoe shuffle suits Spurs|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|author=Patrick Barclay|date=23 February 2002|url=http://telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2431136/Pleats-soft-shoe-shuffle-suits-Spurs.html|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The 10 best managerial celebrations|author=Nick Greenslade|date=4 April 2004|work=[[The Observer]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/observer/osm/story/0,,1182696,00.html|location=London}}</ref>

Luton came close to reaching the FA Cup final in 1985 under Pleat. They were beaten 2–1 by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the semi-final in [[extra time]] at [[Villa Park]]. Luton also lost in the quarter-final against Everton the following year.<ref name=NST2>{{cite news|title=It's Not Over Yet Says Pleat|work=[[New Straits Times]]|date=10 March 1985}}</ref><ref name=NST3>{{cite news|title=Everton In Last Four|work=[[New Straits Times]]|date=14 March 1986}}</ref> Although Luton did not manage to reach a Cup final during Pleat's time in charge, the team that won the 1988 League Cup under [[Ray Harford]], beating Arsenal 3–2 in the final, was largely Pleat's team of the early and mid-1980s, with nine of the starting XI having been his signings.<ref name=NST1 />

===Tottenham Hotspur===
In May 1986, Pleat was appointed manager of [[Tottenham Hotspur]]. He brought [[Mitchell Thomas]] with him from Luton. His earliest change at the club was to bring in [[Richard Gough]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Pleat |first=David |date=2010-01-21 |title=David Pleat: My dream team as a manager after 50 years in football |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/jan/21/david-pleat-50-years-dream-team |access-date=2023-02-08 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> whom he paired with [[Gary Mabbutt]] in defence, moving [[Paul Allen (footballer)|Paul Allen]] into midfield.<ref name=NST1 /> In the 1986–87 season, his only full season as manager, Tottenham Hotspur finished third in the First Division, and reached the [[FA Cup]] final and the semi-final of the [[Football League Cup]]. Pleat received the 'Manager of the Month' awards in both January and February 1987. Glenn Moore, writing in ''[[The Independent]]'' in 1995, described the play during Pleat's stint as manager of Spurs as "some of the best attacking football of the last two decades". During this season, he played with five in midfield including creative players such as [[Osvaldo Ardiles|Ossie Ardiles]], [[Chris Waddle]] and [[Glenn Hoddle]] and just one striker – [[Clive Allen]], who scored 49 goals in all competitions. 

The team narrowly lost 3–2 after extra time in the [[1987 FA Cup final|FA Cup Final]] against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in one of the most exciting matches that Wembley Stadium had witnessed.

Pleat's employment as manager of Tottenham came to an end in October 1987 when he resigned after unsubstantiated newspaper claims about his private life.<ref name="Johnson" />  He was replaced by [[Terry Venables]].<ref name="Moore">{{cite news |author=Glenn Moore |date=16 September 1995 |title=Pleat sustained by his passion for progress |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/pleat-sustained-by-his-passion-for-progress-1601381.html}}</ref>

===Leicester City and return to Luton Town===
Pleat made a quick return to management just two months later with [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], who had just been relegated from the First Division, initially taking them from the lower regions of the Second Division into the top six thanks to 34 points from 17 games. He stayed at [[Filbert Street]] for more than three years but, hampered by financial constraints and the sale of key players such as [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]], [[Gary McAllister]] and [[Russell Osman]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Former Manager Remembers: David Pleat |url=https://www.lcfc.com/news/2193145 |access-date=2023-02-08 |website=www.lcfc.com}}</ref> was unable to help them achieve promotion<ref>{{cite web |title=Motivational Speakers &#124; After Dinner Speakers &#124; Keynote Speakers &#124; GPA |url=https://www.gordonpoole.com/ |website=Gordon Poole Agency Ltd}}</ref> and returned to Luton Town in June 1991 for a second spell as manager of the club. They were relegated at the end of his first season back at [[Kenilworth Road]], missing out on a place in the new [[FA Premier League]], but the club's board kept faith in him. Despite disappointing form in the new Division One, they did reach the FA Cup semi-final in 1994, losing 2–0 to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Lovejoy|first=Joe|title=FA Cup Semi-Final: Bridge bunch live up to Hoddle's hunch: Luton lack the inspiration that undermined other Premiership sides as Chelsea continue prosaic progress to the final|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-commentary--fa-cup-semifinal-bridge-bunch-live-up-to-hoddles-hunch-luton-lack-the-inspiration-that-undermined-other-premiership-sides-as-chelsea-continue-prosaic-progress-to-the-final-1369379.html|access-date=7 April 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=11 April 1994|location=London}}</ref> During his second spell at Luton, he developed a number of players from the youth team including [[Mark Pembridge]], [[John Hartson]], [[Paul Telfer (footballer)|Paul Telfer]] and [[Ceri Hughes]], who would all go on to leave for large transfer fees. In fact, Hartson's £2.5m transfer to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in January 1995 was a British record fee for a teenage player at the time.<ref>{{cite web |title=John Hartson at Arsenal |url=https://www.nostalgicgooner.com/2019/03/john-hartson-at-arsenal.html |access-date=2023-02-08}}</ref>

===Sheffield Wednesday===
Pleat left Luton after being offered the chance to manage Premier League side [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the summer of 1995.<ref name=Johnson>{{cite news|title=Tottenham give Pleat job for rest of season|author=William Johnson|date=12 September 2003|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=http://telegraph.co.uk/sport/2426804/Tottenham-give-Pleat-job-for-rest-of-season.html|location=London}}</ref><ref name=McNulty>{{cite news|title=Pleat the Spurs survivor|author=Phil McNulty|date=24 September 2003|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/3135348.stm|work=BBC Sport}}</ref> His first actions as manager for Wednesday, a position which he took over from [[Trevor Francis]], were to add [[Mark Pembridge]] and [[Marc Degryse]] to the first team squad. His first season at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] was frustrating, as they finished 15th in the Premier League – their lowest finish in five seasons since promotion – with an aging squad of players.

Pleat was tasked by the board with moving on a number of star players deemed to be past their peak during this period with the likes of [[John Sheridan (footballer)|John Sheridan]], [[Chris Woods]], [[Chris Waddle]] and [[Mark Bright]] all departing permanently or on loan throughout 1996, with striker [[David Hirst (footballer)|David Hirst]] following soon after in 1997 as his injury problems continued.

The start of Pleat's second season at the club saw them win their first four fixtures of the 1996–97 season, against [[Aston Villa]], [[Leeds United]], [[Newcastle United]] and Leicester City, earning Pleat the [[Premier League Manager of the Month]] for August 1996 as the Owls topped the Premier League. In October of that season, Pleat signed [[Benito Carbone]], who would become a cult hero at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]]. That summer saw Pleat add another Italian in [[Paolo Di Canio]], who would also go on to make a significant contribution in the Premier League, but after a poor start the following season, Pleat was sacked in November 1997.

===Back to Tottenham===
In 1998, he returned to Tottenham Hotspur with [[Alan Sugar]] appointing him as the club's first [[Director of Football]],<ref name="Johnson" /><ref name="McNulty" />  working alongside then manager [[Christian Gross]], who was soon succeeded by [[George Graham]]. In September 2003, after the sacking of [[Glenn Hoddle]], he took over as caretaker manager,<ref name=McNulty /><ref name=Bright>{{cite news|title=Hoddle sacked after Spurs' poor start|author=Richard Bright|date=22 September 2003|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=http://telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2421916/Hoddle-sacked-after-Spurs-poor-start.html|location=London}}</ref> a position that he held until the end of the season.<ref name=Johnson /><ref>{{cite news|title=Spurs extend Pleat's caretaker role until summer|work=[[The Independent]]|author=Conrad Leach|date=12 September 2003|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/spurs-extend-pleats-caretaker-role-until-summer-576379.html|location=London}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> This was the third of three occasions in which he had been caretaker manager for the club;<ref name=Johnson /> he had previously fulfilled the role in 1998, before [[George Graham (footballer, born 1944)|George Graham]], during which time the team achieved four wins, two draws, and one defeat.  

His ability to unearth young talent continued at [[White Hart Lane]] signing the likes of [[Matthew Etherington]], [[Simon Davies (footballer, born 1979)|Simon Davies]], [[Gary Doherty]] and [[Anthony Gardner]] from the lower leagues, who would all become regular members of the first team and the latter three represented their respective countries at full national team level, while he was also key in the acquisitions of [[Frédéric Kanouté|Frederic Kanoute]], [[Robbie Keane]], [[Jermain Defoe]] and [[Paul Robinson (footballer, born 1979)|Paul Robinson]].

===Other roles and achievements===
Pleat left Tottenham in 2004 and took up advisory roles with [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and Nottingham Forest <ref>{{cite news |date=2006-08-11 |title=Pleat joins Forest coaching staff |language=en-GB |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/nottm_forest/4784915.stm |access-date=2023-02-08}}</ref> before returning to Spurs again in 2010 as a consultant scout. He departed Tottenham at the end of the [[2023–24 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2023/24 season]].<ref>{{cite news |last=White |first=Jim |date=2024-09-10 |title='Arsenal gave Bob Wilson seat for life – I can get Spurs ticket subject to availability' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/09/10/david-pleat-interview-tottenham-hotspur-luton-daniel-levy/ |access-date=2024-09-10 |work=The Telegraph |language=en-GB |issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Pleat has been instrumental in the signings of [[Dele Alli]],<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC Radio 5 Live – In Short, David Pleat: Why Tottenham had to sign Dele Alli |date=23 March 2017 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04xt8y9 |access-date=2023-02-08 |publisher=BBC |language=en-GB}}</ref> [[Jan Vertonghen]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Mondal |first=Subhankar |date=2017-04-22 |title=David Pleat praises Jan Vertonghen for choosing Tottenham Hotspur over Arsenal |url=https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2017/04/22/david-pleat-praises-jan-vertonghen-for-choosing-tottenham-hotspu/ |access-date=2023-02-08 |website=HITC |language=en-GB}}</ref> and [[Ben Davies (footballer, born 1993)|Ben Davies]].

He has also worked for the Premier League as an analyst for youth games and advising on academies.

Pleat is the longest-serving member of the [[League Managers Association]] Board and management committee, having joined in 1978, and, in 2012, he was inducted into the LMA Hall of Fame,<ref>{{cite web |title=League Managers Association - LMA HALL OF FAME DINNER 2012 - MCMENEMY AND PLEAT HONOURED BY THE LMA |url=https://leaguemanagers.com/news/lma-latest/lma-hall-of-fame-dinner-2012-mcmenemy-and-pleat-ho/ |access-date=2023-02-08 |website=leaguemanagers.com}}</ref> which now includes the likes of [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]], [[Fabio Capello]], [[Pep Guardiola]], [[José Mourinho|Jose Mourinho]] and [[Jürgen Klopp|Jurgen Klopp]].

That same year, he was also awarded an M.A. (Hons) at Luton University for his services to football and the media.<ref>{{cite web |title=League Managers Association - DAVID PLEAT |url=https://leaguemanagers.com/managers/david-pleat/ |access-date=2023-02-08 |website=leaguemanagers.com}}</ref>

He has served on a number of FA panels concerning discipline, transfer tribunals and permits for overseas players.
