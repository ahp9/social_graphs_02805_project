'''Karl Fredrik "Freddie" Ljungberg''' ({{IPA|sv|ˈfrěːdrɪk ˈjɵ̂ŋːbærj}}; born 16 April 1977) is a Swedish former professional [[association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]]. He is also a former [[Manager (association football)|manager]], and was most recently an assistant coach, and interim head coach of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].

He began his career at [[Halmstads BK|Halmstad]] and went on to spend most of his career at Arsenal, where he won honours including two [[Premier League]] titles and three [[FA Cup]]s, scoring in two finals including the [[2002 FA Cup Final|victory in 2002]]. After leaving Arsenal in 2007, he had short spells at a number of clubs in England, Scotland, the United States, Japan and India. An international for a full decade, Ljungberg earned 75 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] and represented [[Sweden men's national football team|Sweden national team]] at [[UEFA Euro 2000]], [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008]], as well as at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s. He was [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of Sweden from 2006 until he announced his international retirement after UEFA Euro 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundersfc.com/post/2008/10/28/swedish-star-fredrik-ljungberg-signs|title=Swedish star Fredrik Ljungberg signs on|access-date=11 April 2019|archive-date=11 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411142406/https://www.soundersfc.com/post/2008/10/28/swedish-star-fredrik-ljungberg-signs|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Early life==
Ljungberg was born on 16 April 1977 in [[Vittsjö]] to Roy Alve Erling Ljungberg, an owner of a construction and consultant business with a masters in engineering, and Elisabeth Bodil Ljungberg, a Swedish Labor Department worker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/I%27ll+beat+Poles+for+the+Mirror%3b+SWEDISH+STAR+FREDDIE+LJUNGBERG%27S...-a060335175|title=I'll beat Poles for the Mirror; Swedish star Freddie Ljungberg's promise to fans|first=Jeremy|last=Armstrong|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=9 October 1999|access-date=9 March 2010|archive-date=25 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210325133809/https://www.thefreelibrary.com/I%27ll+beat+Poles+for+the+Mirror%3B+SWEDISH+STAR+FREDDIE+LJUNGBERG%27S...-a060335175|url-status=live}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=May 2020}} On 12 September 1984, the Ljungbergs had another son, Karl Oskar Filip.<ref name="aftonbladet1">{{cite news |title=Så formades den svenska modellen |first=Peter |last=Maaherra |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/vm2006/article386794.ab |date=17 June 2006 |newspaper=Aftonbladet |access-date=19 February 2009 |archive-date=3 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803203822/http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/vm2006/article386794.ab |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1982, the Ljungberg family left Vittsjö and moved to [[Halmstad]]. At first, the tenacious five-year old would not have any part of moving. He argued with his parents that he did not want to live in Halmstad. His parents relented and took him to [[Halmstads BK]], where he played on the youth team under manager [[Olle Eriksson (footballer, born 1918)|Olle Eriksson]].<ref name="aftonbladet1"/>

From the time he was from five to fourteen, Ljungberg was coached by Eriksson. Eriksson's impression of the youngster was that he was remarkably talented for his age and that he was considerate of other players, noting that Ljungberg would pass the ball to his friends, so that they would have a chance to score.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corren.se/nYhEteR/artikel.aspx?articleid=4437586 |title=Östergötlands största nyhetssajt |publisher=Corren.se |access-date=23 February 2014 |archive-date=2 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302003322/http://www.corren.se/nYhEteR/artikel.aspx?articleid=4437586 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He credits the Brazilian footballer [[Sócrates]], and Eriksson for having a profound effect on his career.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sluta med hyckleriet |first=Lasse |last=Anrell |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/kronikorer/anrell/article107249.ab |date=24 November 2002 |newspaper=Aftonbladet |access-date=19 February 2009 |archive-date=13 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013115633/http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/kronikorer/anrell/article107249.ab |url-status=live }}</ref> During his youth days, Ljungberg also enjoyed playing [[ice hockey]] and developed a talent for [[handball]]; he was eventually called up to the under-15 national handball team,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/3027277/My-Sport-Freddie-Ljungberg.html|title=My Sport: Freddie Ljungberg|first=Gareth A|last=Davies|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=6 May 2002|access-date=23 February 2014|archive-date=29 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329134931/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/3027277/My-Sport-Freddie-Ljungberg.html|url-status=live}}</ref> but decided to focus his attentions on football.

Ljungberg did well in academic subjects and sports. When he finished ninth grade in his [[högstadium]] school, his marks averaged 4.1 on the five-point scale.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotbollsbladet/landslagsfotboll/vm2006/article386797.ab|title=Så minns klass-kompisarna Fredrik|newspaper=Aftonbladet|date=17 June 2006|access-date=8 June 2009|archive-date=17 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717220851/http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotbollsbladet/landslagsfotboll/vm2006/article386797.ab|url-status=live}}</ref> At the age of 18, Ljungberg attended university to study information technology and economics, but he struggled to balance the hectic academic timetable with the physically demanding commitments of professional football. Eventually, he quit university to concentrate on his football career.<ref>{{Cite web|title=My Sport: Freddie Ljungberg|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/3027277/My-Sport-Freddie-Ljungberg.html|access-date=17 September 2020|website=The Telegraph|date=6 May 2002 |language=en-GB|archive-date=23 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211223114258/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/3027277/My-Sport-Freddie-Ljungberg.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Club career==

===Halmstad===
In 1989, at the age of 12, Ljungberg had convinced [[Halmstads BK]] to move him from P12 to P14 which was against Halmstad's policies at the time.<ref name="aftonbladet.se">{{cite news|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotbollsbladet/article106318.ab|title=Jag är oerhört stolt och hedrad|date=19 November 2002|newspaper=Aftonbladet|access-date=5 September 2009}}</ref> At age 14, Ljungberg joined the junior team under coach Robert Nordström. His perseverance paid off because three years later he was moved up to the senior team.

Ljungberg made his senior debut on 23 October 1994 in the [[Allsvenskan]] against [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]]. In 1995, Ljungberg played 31 games in which he scored his first goal as a professional player. That same year, Halmstad won [[Svenska Cupen]]. In 1997, Halmstad won the Allsvenskan with Ljungberg netting and assisting goals that season for the club, despite picking up injuries. During his time with Halmstad, he went on to make 139 appearances and score 16 goals for the club. After winning several trophies in his years with Halmstad, Ljungberg's star was on the rise with interest from [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arseweb.com/98-99/Ljungberg.html |title=Possible New Arsenal signing |date=11 September 1998 |publisher=Arseweb |access-date=8 June 2009 |archive-date=25 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210325133824/https://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js |url-status=live }}</ref>{{better source needed|date=May 2020}}

===Arsenal===

Ljungberg was signed by Arsenal in 1998 for £3 million. Arsenal scouts watched him for over a year and Arsenal's manager, [[Arsène Wenger]], took the unusual step of authorising the signing after watching Ljungberg play for [[Sweden men's national football team|Sweden]] in their victory against [[England national football team|England]] on television,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/164606.stm |title=Awful England suffer Stockholm shocker |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 September 1998 |access-date=30 March 2020 |archive-date=8 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211208082140/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/164606.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> without seeing him play live. Seeing Ljungberg's performance against England only confirmed to Wenger that Ljungberg could cope against English opponents, and he was signed shortly after. Ljungberg proved himself without difficulty and scored on his debut on 20 September after coming on as a substitute against rival club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], the match ending 3–0.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-united-eclipsed-by-the-champions-1199753.html|title=United eclipsed by the champions|newspaper=The Independent|date=20 September 1998|access-date=26 December 2010|first=Glenn|last=Moore|archive-date=10 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110055416/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-united-eclipsed-by-the-champions-1199753.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Ljungberg made 21 appearances across all competitions in his first season, and 43 in his second (1999-2000).<ref>{{Soccerbase season|15103|1999|name=Fredrik Ljungberg|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> He missed the [[2000 UEFA Cup Final]] due to a rib injury.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/gunners-favoured-over-galatasaray-in-uefa-cup-final-1.210706 |title=Gunners favoured over Galatasaray in UEFA Cup final |publisher=cbc.ca |date=15 May 2000 |access-date=30 March 2020 |archive-date=18 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918174135/https://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/gunners-favoured-over-galatasaray-in-uefa-cup-final-1.210706 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the end of his third season at Arsenal, 2000–01, they got to the [[2001 FA Cup Final]].

Some of Ljungberg's best form came in the second half of the [[2001–02 Arsenal F.C. season|2001–02 season]], when Arsenal won their second [[2001–02 FA Premier League|Premier League]] and [[2001–02 FA Cup|FA Cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]]. Following a knee injury to [[Robert Pires]], Ljungberg scored in most of Arsenal's remaining games, including a stunning finish for Arsenal's second goal in the 2–0 [[2002 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] win over Chelsea. Ljungberg had scored many important and vital goals for Arsenal throughout the season. He scored an equaliser against Manchester United, in a game where Arsenal went on to win 3–1.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/1671459.stm |title=Barthez errors gift Arsenal win |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 November 2001 |access-date=30 March 2020 |archive-date=18 December 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021218020413/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1671459.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> He was instrumental in Arsenal's 2–1 win against Liverpool at Anfield where he won a penalty which [[Thierry Henry]] scored and then he slotted in a sweet finish from a Pires cross.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/1723104.stm |title=Gunners seal vital victory |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 December 2001 |access-date=30 March 2020 |archive-date=6 April 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040406163933/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1723104.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> He scored a nearly identical goal again against Liverpool at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] three weeks later, where the matched ended up being a 1–1 draw.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/1758505.stm |title=Riise restores Reds' pride |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 January 2002 |access-date=30 March 2020 |archive-date=22 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230122104049/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/1758505.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> Ljungberg ended the 2001–02 season scoring 17 goals in all competitions.

In the [[2002–03 Arsenal F.C. season|2002–03 season]] Ljungberg helped Arsenal reach [[2003 FA Cup Final|a third consecutive FA Cup final]].

In [[2003–04 Arsenal F.C. season|2003–04]] Ljungberg made 30 league appearances during Arsenal's unbeaten [[The Invincibles (football)|Invincibles]] season.<ref>{{Soccerbase season|15103|2003|name=Fredrik Ljungberg|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> That season he scored the winning goal against rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur]] at Highbury.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/3232991.stm |title=Arsenal break Spurs hearts |publisher=BBC |date=8 November 2003 |access-date=30 March 2020 |archive-date=3 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220103174902/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3232991.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> The following season (2004–05) Ljungberg played in [[2005 FA Cup Final|his fourth FA Cup final]], when he came on as a substitute and scored one of Arsenal's penalties in the shootout as they defeated [[Manchester United]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/4558271.stm |title=Arsenal 0-0 Man Utd (aet) |website=BBC Sport |date=21 May 2005 |access-date=27 March 2020 |archive-date=14 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814023916/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/4558271.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>

He was most comfortable as a [[Winger (association football)|winger]] on either side of midfield, though he could also play centrally in a [[Formation (association football)#4–5–1|4–5–1]] formation, or even as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]]. Ljungberg became a regular in Arsenal's starting line-up following the departure of [[Emmanuel Petit]] and [[Marc Overmars]] in the summer of 2000. For several seasons he played a major role for the club including being a member of the [[The Invincibles (football)|unbeaten 49-game run]] for Arsenal. He had to fight with constant injury problems and occasionally severe bouts with [[migraine]]s; in 2005 a persistent hip injury led to fears he may have contracted cancer, which were unfounded. It transpired that he was suffering from blood poisoning caused by his large tattoos.<ref>{{cite news |title=Soccer star in health scare over tattoo ink |first=Duncan |last=Gardham |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1490461/Soccer-star-in-health-scare-over-tattoo-ink.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1490461/Soccer-star-in-health-scare-over-tattoo-ink.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |newspaper=Telegraph |access-date=23 February 2014|date=21 May 2005}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Despite a persistent [[Sprained ankle|ankle injury]], Ljungberg played for Arsenal in the 2–1 defeat by Barcelona in the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League Final]] in Paris on 17 May 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4773353.stm |title=Barcelona 2-1 Arsenal |publisher=BBC |date=17 May 2006 |access-date=30 March 2020 |archive-date=9 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009001809/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4773353.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>

It was speculated in January 2007 that Ljungberg was being forced to leave Arsenal, after bosses became tired of a run of injuries restricting his play. "Ljungberg still has a lot to offer to Arsenal," Arsène Wenger said, on 13 January 2007, at a [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] pre-match press conference, stressing the fact that Ljungberg will stay at Arsenal until the end of his contract in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wenger – Ljungberg is definitely staying here |first=Chris |last=Harris |url=http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=news&article=441216&cpid=703&title=Wenger+-+Ljungberg+is+definitely+staying+here |access-date=13 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195633/http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=news&article=441216&cpid=703&title=Wenger+-+Ljungberg+is+definitely+staying+here |archive-date=27 September 2007 |publisher=Arsenal FC }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/6290162.stm |title=Wenger expects Ljungberg to stay |work=BBC Sport |date=16 July 2007 |access-date=8 June 2009 |archive-date=25 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210325133833/https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/v51.js |url-status=live }}</ref>

Ljungberg came back after a long injury in an [[2006–07 FA Cup|FA Cup]] match against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], scoring a goal thirteen minutes before the end of [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]], earning Arsenal a place in the fifth round tie of the FA Cup against Blackburn Rovers.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/6349615.stm |title=Bolton 1-3 Arsenal (aet) |publisher=BBC |date=14 February 2007 |access-date=30 March 2020 |archive-date=25 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225173252/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/6349615.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> In a game away at rivals Tottenham Hotspur on 21 April 2007 Ljungberg limped off with an injury in the first half, and this proved to be his final appearance for the club.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6555249.stm |title=Tottenham 2-2 Arsenal |publisher=BBC |date=21 April 2007 |access-date=30 March 2020 |archive-date=5 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211105153706/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6555249.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>

===West Ham United===
On 23 July 2007, after nine years at Arsenal, Ljungberg joined London rivals [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on a four-year contract.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hodges |first=Vicki |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2317525/West-Ham-sign-Freddie-Ljungberg.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2317525/West-Ham-sign-Freddie-Ljungberg.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=West Ham sign Freddie Ljungberg |date=23 July 2007|access-date=8 June 2009 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph }}{{cbignore}}</ref> Ljungberg made his West Ham debut on the opening day of the [[2007–08 West Ham United F.C. season|2007–08 season]], in West Ham's 2–0 home defeat by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 11 August, a game in which he was also captain. After seven months at the club, Ljungberg finally scored his first goal for West Ham in the home match against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on 9 February 2008, putting West Ham up 1–0, with the game finishing 1–1.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7223969.stm |title=West Ham 1–1 Birmingham |work=BBC Sport |date=9 February 2008 |access-date=27 August 2009 |first=Owen |last=Phillips |archive-date=10 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810183218/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7223969.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> Ljungberg also scored what turned out to be his final goal for the club in a 2–1 defeat away at [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] a month later.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7309366.stm |title=Sunderland 2–1 West Ham |work=BBC Sport |date=29 March 2008 |access-date=27 August 2009 |first=Sarah |last=Holt |archive-date=3 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403033834/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7309366.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>

In his last game of the season, [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] defender [[Steven Taylor (footballer)|Steven Taylor]] accidentally landed on top of him while trying to jump over him, breaking his ribs. The injury sidelined Ljungberg for the rest of the season.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/7369605.stm |title=Cracked rib agony for Ljungberg |work=BBC Sport |date=27 April 2008 |access-date=8 June 2009 |archive-date=1 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501021925/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/7369605.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> In May, it was reported that Ljungberg was offered £3 million to tear up his contract. This was quickly dismissed by both Ljungberg's agents, [[Claes Elefalk]] and Scott Duxbury, West Ham's chief executive.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11685_3541595,00.html |title=Ljungberg rumours rejected |publisher=Sky Sports |access-date=8 June 2009 |archive-date=10 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510185745/http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11685_3541595,00.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In June 2008, Ljungberg retired from the Sweden national team, saying:"I have decided to concentrate on my football with West Ham. This is where my priority now lies."<ref>{{Cite web|date=28 June 2008|title=Fredrik Ljungberg leaves national team|url=https://www.thelocal.se/20080628/12708|access-date=17 September 2020|website=www.thelocal.se|archive-date=12 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210412025223/https://www.thelocal.se/20080628/12708|url-status=live}}</ref>

Following the start of training camp, Ljungberg was nowhere to be seen. Many speculated a transfer was in the works despite Elefalk's claims that Ljungberg was to return. Days later, Ljungberg agreed to terminate his contract only after one year into the four-year deal for a sum of £6 million. Ljungberg stated afterwards: "I gave my all at West Ham and enjoyed my time there but the decision is the best for the both of us. Now, I will take my time to consider my football future."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/13532/20080806/ |title=West Ham release Freddie Ljungberg |website=The Local |date=6 August 2008 |access-date=8 June 2009 |archive-date=5 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605093751/http://www.thelocal.se/13532/20080806/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Football hiatus===
After Ljungberg's West Ham exit, fans and sport pundits alike speculated about Ljungberg's future. On 8 August, Ljungberg was seen in Los Angeles fuelling rumours of a move to [[LA Galaxy]] which was quickly dismissed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2008/08/09/freddie-ljungberg-may-join-becks-at-la-galaxy-115875-20690414/ |title=Freddie Ljungberg may join Becks at LA Galaxy |work=Mirror |date=9 August 2008 |access-date=8 June 2009 |archive-date=5 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605190333/http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2008/08/09/freddie-ljungberg-may-join-becks-at-la-galaxy-115875-20690414/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In actuality, Ljungberg went to Los Angeles to get a tattoo done by renowned tattoo artist [[Mister Cartoon]]. While he was in Los Angeles, Elefalk urged Ljungberg to meet with [[Joe Roth]], a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] producer and majority stakeholder in the [[Major League Soccer]] expansion team [[Seattle Sounders FC]]. Ljungberg secretly met with Roth but did not want to make any rash decisions. At the same time, there were rumours of four Italian clubs being interested in Ljungberg including [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], and [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]].<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Anthony|last=Sormani|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/soccer/08/12/ljungberg.italy/|title=Four Italian clubs fighting over Ljungberg|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=12 August 2008|access-date=8 June 2009|archive-date=29 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629114924/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/soccer/08/12/ljungberg.italy/|url-status=dead}}</ref> By the end of August, Ljungberg was linked to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Portsmouth-close-in-on-Freddie-Ljungberg-signing-article53181.html |title=Portsmouth close in on Freddie Ljungberg signing |work=Mirror |date=29 August 2008 |access-date=23 February 2014 |archive-date=30 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130101345/http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Portsmouth-close-in-on-Freddie-Ljungberg-signing-article53181.html |url-status=live }}</ref> On 28 August, Ljungberg's agent told the Swedish press that Ljungberg was continuing to train at his old football club Halmstads BK but was unsure of his football future. At the end of the transfer window, Ljungberg was linked to [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]]. When Ljungberg declined to join Monaco after the transfer window closed, many believed Ljungberg was finished with football.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11816/4078855 |title=Monaco miss out on Freddie |publisher=Sky Sports |date=1 September 2008 |access-date=23 February 2014 |archive-date=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227032518/http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11816/4078855 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In early September, Ljungberg was seen in New York City during [[New York Fashion Week]]. At this time, the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' reported that Ljungberg was looking to become a furniture designer. Shortly after, Ljungberg was seen in London with [[Natalie Imbruglia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/klick/article3649920.ab|title=Så träffades Fredrik Ljungberg och Natalie|newspaper=Aftonbladet|date=31 October 2008|access-date=8 June 2009|archive-date=4 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204001710/http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/klick/article3649920.ab|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Seattle Sounders FC===

On 17 October 2008, the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' reported that Ljungberg might be a part of the new Major League Soccer franchise [[Seattle Sounders FC]]. On 28 October 2008, the club officially announced they had signed Ljungberg as their [[Designated Player Rule|designated player]] for the 2009 season. The terms of his contract saw Ljungberg earn $10 million over two seasons with the Sounders. Much like the contract of [[David Beckham]] and as is the norm for professional sports stars in the US, Ljungberg's contract assured that he kept all of the money derived from his private endorsements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Freddie-Ljungberg-set-to-earn-10m-after-signing-for-Seattle-Sounders-article33674.html|title=Freddie Ljungberg set to earn $10m after signing for Seattle Sounders|work=Mirror|date=28 October 2008|access-date=23 February 2014|archive-date=10 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810094631/http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Freddie-Ljungberg-set-to-earn-10m-after-signing-for-Seattle-Sounders-article33674.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Because of this, Grahame L.

In December 2008, it was announced that Ljungberg would undergo surgery to repair a persistent hip injury that has plagued him throughout his later career. Surgeons repaired a slightly torn [[Acetabular labrum|hip labrum]] and shaved a small amount of bone where the hip meets the [[femur]] to prevent future injury. ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' reported that Ljungberg was expected to miss ten to twelve weeks of training and possibly be sidelined for the team's inaugural game, but he recovered from his hip injury sooner than expected. Although Ljungberg did not take part of Seattle's preseason in Argentina, he did however do light training with [[IS Halmia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hd.se/sport/2009/02/25/ljungberg-traenar-med-halmia/ |title=Ljungberg tränar med Halmia |language=sv |publisher=hd.se |date=25 February 2009 |access-date=5 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227060658/http://hd.se/sport/2009/02/25/ljungberg-traenar-med-halmia/ |archive-date=27 February 2009 }}</ref>

Once the Sounders returned to Seattle, Ljungberg joined in training. Despite his speedy recovery, Ljungberg did not participate in the inaugural game against [[New York Red Bulls]]. He made his debut one week later on 28 March 2009, coming on as a 61st-minute substitute in a 2–0 victory over [[Real Salt Lake]]. The following week he made his first start on 4 April 2009 against [[Toronto FC]], where he also scored his first MLS goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/260869/report.html|title=Report: Toronto FC vs Seattle Sounders FC|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=4 April 2009|access-date=5 September 2009|archive-date=27 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227103244/http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/260869/report.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Ljungberg played his first full game against [[Chivas USA]] in Los Angeles in which they lost 2–0. While some noted that [[Fredy Montero]] and Ljungberg were not cohesive on the pitch, due to Ljungberg's absence in the preseason and few practices with one other, coach [[Sigi Schmid]] answered: "That's just something that takes some time. But they're both quality players and it will get sorted out I think a lot sooner than later."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/sports/article/Sounders-seek-to-get-back-on-track-against-Quakes-1303517.php |title=Sounders seek to get back on track against Quakes |first=Greg |last=Johns |publisher=The Hearst Corporation |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=24 April 2009 |access-date=7 September 2013 |archive-date=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227011759/http://www.seattlepi.com/sports/article/Sounders-seek-to-get-back-on-track-against-Quakes-1303517.php |url-status=live }}</ref>

Ljungberg missed two games against [[FC Dallas]] and [[Colorado Rapids]] due to a migraine attack. He quickly recovered to play against Chivas USA. On 30 May 2009, the Sounders drew their fifth match in a row, this time against the [[Columbus Crew SC|Columbus Crew]], after Ljungberg missed a penalty kick in the 31st minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/262182/report.html|title=Report: Seattle Sounders FC vs Columbus|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=31 May 2009|access-date=23 February 2014|archive-date=27 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227110504/http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/262182/report.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Ljungberg scored his second goal for the season against the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] on 13 June 2009 as a result of beating [[Joe Cannon (soccer)|Joe Cannon]] to the ball, lofting it over him and into the center of the net.

He was subbed out toward the end of the game, in which he received a standing ovation. Ljungberg sat out for the US Open Cup game against the [[USL First Division|USL]] side [[Portland Timbers (2001–10)|Portland Timbers]] and focused on training during the four-week vacation in July. Following the brief holiday vacation, Seattle defeated [[Houston Dynamo]], a game in which Ljungberg was heavily targeted and fouled. Despite this, Ljungberg outmaneuvered his opponents and assisted a goal to [[Patrick Ianni]]. As is so, the ''[[Bleacher Report]]'' thus dubbed him the man of the match.<ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Hiles |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/216739-mls-game-of-the-week-player-ratings-sounders-2-1-dynamo |title=MLS Game of the Week Player Ratings – Sounders 2–1 Dynamo |website=Bleacher Report |date=12 July 2009 |access-date=5 September 2009 |archive-date=26 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226053035/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/216739-mls-game-of-the-week-player-ratings-sounders-2-1-dynamo |url-status=live }}</ref>

During his [[2009 Seattle Sounders FC season|2009 season]], the ''[[Daily Express]]'' noted rumors that Ljungberg was poised to return to a European club, but Ljungberg assured fans that he would stay to fulfill his two-year contract. The Swede also gave the insight that he might even extend his contract beyond 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/football/view/114670/Freddie-s-so-glad-to-have-gone-west |title=Freddie's so glad to have gone West |publisher=Express.co.uk |date=18 July 2009 |access-date=5 September 2009 |archive-date=5 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405160858/http://www.express.co.uk/football/view/114670/Freddie-s-so-glad-to-have-gone-west |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Seattle Sounders starting XI prematch vs Barcelona 2010.png|thumb|Ljungberg (front, second from left) lining up for Seattle Sounders FC in August 2009 ahead of a friendly against Barcelona]]
In July 2009, Ljungberg was selected for starting MLS' [[Major League Soccer All-Star Game|All-Stars]] along with teammate [[Kasey Keller]]. Selection for the All-Star team is based upon votes from players, coaches, general managers, members of the media and an online fan voting system. Ljungberg received the most votes among fans, a testament to his popularity in the MLS. Ljungberg was also appointed captain of the 2009 MLS All-Star Team in their game over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].

Due to receiving a red card in the previous game, Ljungberg was ineligible to play the next Sounders game. As a result, All-Star coach [[Dominic Kinnear]] played Ljungberg for a full 90 minutes. At the end of the game, Ljungberg started to have impaired vision. When the game went to [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty kicks]], he chose to sit it out due to his loss of vision after an on-set migraine.<ref>{{cite news|first=José Miguel|last=Romero|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sounders/2009565037_mlsstars30.html|title=Sounders FC star Freddie Ljungberg hospitalized after All-Star Game|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=30 July 2009|access-date=5 September 2009|archive-date=2 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802184454/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sounders/2009565037_mlsstars30.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Unfortunately for Ljungberg, the initial five kicks ended in a draw. Kinnear, not fully understanding Ljungberg's condition, sent him out as the sixth kicker. Ljungberg, unable to see, took a chance and just tapped the ball in the center of the net.

==International career==
===Youth===
In 1996, Ljungberg made his debut for the [[Sweden national under-21 football team|Sweden national U-21 team]]. He almost did not make it as an international player because Sweden head coach [[Lars Lagerbäck]] thought Ljungberg was too short. In the 2003 documentary film ''Fredrik Ljungberg: Up Close'', Lagerbäck stated: "Of course it's difficult to say at 15 to 16 years of age (whether or not a player has the potential to be an international player). To be honest, I wouldn't say I thought he would become an international player because he was very very little. In his first match, we played [[Denmark national under-21 football team|Denmark]] and he scored twice so he convinced me rather fast that he was a good player even if he was very very small but he was quick."<ref>"Fredrik Ljungberg: UP Close", Director Carey Dunn; Sky One, 2003</ref> On 10 November 1996, Ljungberg scored twice in a game against [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland U21]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/a-lesson-in-swedish-1351704.html |work=The Independent |title=A lesson in Swedish |first=Phil |last=Gordon |date=10 November 1996 |access-date=2 May 2010 |archive-date=5 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105190349/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/a-lesson-in-swedish-1351704.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

====2002 FIFA World Cup====
During an open team practice before the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], Ljungberg broke into a fight with teammate [[Olof Mellberg]] following a robust tackle from the latter.

Sweden was a part of [[2002 FIFA World Cup Group F|Group F]], dubbed the 'Group of Death', which included [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], England and [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]. At the time, Ljungberg was suffering from a hip injury which prevented him from playing in most of the games.<ref>{{Cite web|date=29 May 2002|title=Hip injury hampers Ljungberg|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/may/29/worldcupfootball2002.sport8|access-date=17 September 2020|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-date=20 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191220143843/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/may/29/worldcupfootball2002.sport8|url-status=live}}</ref> However, Ljungberg did muster the strength to play against England on 2 June 2002 and Nigeria on 7 June 2002 despite the pain. After Sweden advanced from group death, the team was defeated by [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]].

The match ended with 0–0 draw in which Ljungberg attempted two shots but failed to score.

====2006 FIFA World Cup====
[[File:Fredrik Ljungberg 2006.jpg|thumb|Ljungberg representing Sweden at the 2006 FIFA World Cup]]
Prior to the finals, the team doctor Magnus Forssblad prohibited Ljungberg from participating in full-blown training between matches to protect his injured foot. His right foot was swollen due to fluid building up inside his ankle joint.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Ljungberg sat out the warm-up games against [[Finland national football team|Finland]] and [[Chile national football team|Chile]] at Sweden's base in [[Bremen]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Despite being advised to take time off, Ljungberg insisted on playing in the cup to help Sweden win.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Sweden's weak start was quickly forgotten after their victory against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. However, Paraguay almost held out for a scoreless tie until Ljungberg scored in the 89th minute giving Sweden a 1–0 victory.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Sweden's third match within the group was against England, resulting in a 2–2 draw.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
Despite the draw, Sweden advanced to the next round only to lose 0–2 against host nation [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. Ljungberg received the [[Guldbollen]] award for helping Sweden advance to the next round in the World Cup by heading in the game-winning goal against Paraguay: "I am proud and humble to get this award,''" ''Ljungberg said.'' ''"If you look at the football year 2006, it was very eventful. ... If I should try to sum it up, the Champions League final left some deep marks. That felt heavy.

Sweden qualified for the European Championship with six wins.

Prior to [[UEFA Euro 2008]], Ljungberg fractured his ribs, making his appearance in the tournament uncertain. However, Ljungberg was able to participate in the Euro and played the games with a special brace to protect his healing ribs. Ljungberg was able to start in Sweden's first match against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] which ended in a 2–0 victory. Sweden's next match was against one of the favorites, Spain. Sweden were able to contain Spain who struggled from making big advances. However, Sweden lost that match 1–2.

Sweden was unable to compete with the young [[Russia national football team|Russia]] squad and were defeated 0–2.<ref name=SoccernetProf/> Despite Sweden's early dismissal from the tournament, Ljungberg was considered by newspapers in Sweden, France, Italy, Germany and the host nation Austria as being Sweden's leading player throughout the competition.
