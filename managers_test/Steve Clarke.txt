On 12 May 2011, Clarke, as well as manager Dalglish, signed a three-year contract to remain in his role as first team coach.

On 14 May 2012, Clarke offered his resignation to Liverpool following the sacking of manager Dalglish and Liverpool's eighth-place finish in the 2011–12 Premier League. The club declined the offer, but on 6 June 2012, following the appointment of new manager [[Brendan Rodgers]], Clarke left the club.<ref name=poolexit>{{cite web |title=Liverpool first team coach Steve Clarke leaves club|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18344557|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 June 2012 |access-date=24 August 2012}}</ref> Clarke himself said that Liverpool sacked him.<ref>{{cite news|title=Clarke – I was sacked by Reds|url=http://www1.skysports.com/news/11095/7998028/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=17 August 2012|access-date=24 August 2012}}</ref>

===West Bromwich Albion===
On 8 June 2012, Clarke was appointed manager of [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and signed a two-year contract.

====2012–13 season====
Albion began the Clarke era with a 3–0 home win against Liverpool on the opening day of the [[2012–13 Premier League]] season. Clarke then followed that result up with a 1–1 away draw against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and a 2–0 win at home to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. Clarke suffered his first competitive defeat away at Fulham, but West Brom soon jumped back with 1–0 home victory over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. In November, the club won four consecutive matches in a row for the first time since 1980, defeating [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], Chelsea and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20374862|title=Sunderland 2-4 West Brom|first=Jamie |last=Lillywhite|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> Clarke was named Premier League manager of the month for November 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20680192|title=West Brom's Steve Clarke wins Manager of the Month award|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> Although the team would go on to lose their next three matches, Clarke's team would bounce back with a draw at home to West Ham and a 2–1 win over [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]. By Christmas 2012, West Brom were seventh in the table with 30 points, behind teams like [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and Spurs only on goal difference. During the January transfer window, Clarke encountered some problems with want-away Nigerian Striker [[Peter Odemwingie]], who desired a move to [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], but West Brom refused to sell.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/28/peter-odemwingie-west-brom-qpr-bid | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Peter Odemwingie furious as West Bromwich reject new £2m QPR bid | date=28 January 2013}}</ref> Odemwingie was ultimately never sold and was later given time off following the transfer window saga.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/west-bromwich-albion/9841681/West-Brom-striker-Peter-Odemwingie-dropped-for-Tottenham-game-following-transfer-deadline-day-farce.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Paul | last=Kelso | title=West Brom striker Peter Odemwingie dropped for Tottenham game following transfer deadline day farce | date=1 February 2013}}</ref> It was during this January period that the club struggled to emulate their early season form. Following a poor run of results which saw West Brom fail to win in six consecutive games, Clarke oversaw a 2–0 victory against Liverpool at [[Anfield]], the club's first win since Boxing Day against QPR.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21318809|title=Liverpool 0-2 West Brom |first=Alistair |last=Magowan|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

West Brom won 3–0 at Southampton on 27 April, which was their 14th win of the season. This set club records for wins (14) and points (48) in a Premier League season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22228828|title=Southampton 0-3 West Brom|first=Chris |last=McKenna|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> West Brom ended the season in style with a dramatic 5–5 draw with Manchester United, in what was [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]]'s final match as manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22499117|title=West Brom 5-5 Manchester United|first=Neil |last=Johnston|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> The draw saw West Brom finish eighth in the table, their best finish since 1981.

====2013–14 season====
Clarke and West Brom returned for the new season with a 1–0 home loss to Southampton at [[The Hawthorns]] following a 90th-minute [[Rickie Lambert]] penalty.<ref name="wba201314">{{cite web | url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=2744&teamTabs=results | title=West Brom 2013-14 | publisher=soccerbase.com | access-date=16 December 2013}}</ref> The team initially struggled to score goals, eventually recording their first league goal the fourth game of the new season when [[Gareth McAuley]] scored an injury time header in a 1–1 result against Fulham.<ref name=wba201314/> 28 September 2013 saw them secure an historic 2–1 victory against league champions, Manchester United, their first win at [[Old Trafford]] in 35 years.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24331861 | title=Bryan Robson: West Brom deserved Manchester United win | publisher=BBC Sport | access-date=16 December 2013}}</ref> Under his managership, however, they won only one further game, a 2–0 home defeat of [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 2 November 2013.<ref name=wba201314/> On 9 November, West Brom were minutes away from securing a historic win at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] that would have ended José Mourinho's undefeated home record, but a controversial penalty decision ensured that the game ended 2–2.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24783075|title=Chelsea 2-2 West Bromwich Albion|first=Sam |last=Sheringham|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> A further draw and four straight defeats followed and on 14 December 2013 Clarke was placed on [[gardening leave]] until May 2014, after a 1–0 loss at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].
