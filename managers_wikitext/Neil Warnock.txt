'''Neil Warnock''' (born 1 December 1948) is an English [[association football|football]] [[Manager (association football)|manager]] and former player who is currently a football advisor for [[National League South]] club [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]]. He is also a television and radio pundit. In a managerial career spanning five decades, Warnock has managed sixteen different clubs from the [[Premier League]] to [[Non-League football|non-league]]. Within [[English football]], he holds the record for the most promotions, with eight, and the most games as a professional manager, with 1626, beating the previous record of 1601 set by [[Dario Gradi]].<ref name=record/>

Warnock played as a [[Left winger|winger]] for [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]], [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool]], [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]], [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], [[York City F.C.|York City]] and [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]], scoring 36 goals in 327 career league appearances. He retired from league football in 1979, aged 30. His playing career continued in the 1979–1980 season with non-league [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] making nine appearances and scoring six goals until an injury cut his season short.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite news |date=31 May 2020 |title=Why Warnock saw Burton Albion as his ideal start in management |publisher=Derby Telegraph |url=https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/warnock-saw-burton-albion-ideal-4177310}}</ref> He finished his playing career when returning to [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] as player manager in the 1981–1982 season, playing in 29 games and scoring three goals, before concentrating on management for the rest of his time at Burton.<ref name="Wellington Street to Wembley, Burton Albion, the Complete History, 1950-1990 by former Burton Mail sports editor, Rex Page">{{Cite book |last=Page |first=Rex |title=Wellington Street to Wembley, Burton Albion, the Complete History, 1950-1990 |year=1990 |pages=48–51}}</ref>

Warnock's first managerial job was with non-League [[Gainsborough Trinity F.C.|Gainsborough Trinity]] (1980–1981), he would subsequently manage [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] (1981–1986) and [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]] (1986–1989), winning promotion to the [[Football League]] with the latter in 1987. He then managed [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] (1989–1993), leading them from the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in successive seasons, though he was dismissed after the club were relegated the season before the First Division became known as the Premiership. After a brief spell at [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] (1993), he moved to [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] (1993–1995), with whom he won promotion to the new First Division. He then resigned and joined [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] (1995–1997), leading them to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. After being dismissed, he spent spells with [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] (1997–1998) and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] (1998–1999).

In 1999, Warnock joined boyhood club [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], leading them to the semi-finals of the [[2002–03 Football League Cup#Semi-finals|League Cup]] and [[2002–03 FA Cup#Semi-finals|FA Cup]] in 2003 and promotion to the Premier League in 2006. However, he resigned in 2007 after the club were relegated. He then took over at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] (2007–2010), saving the club from relegation to [[Football League One|League One]]. When the club went into administration, he left to join [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] (2010–2012), winning promotion to the Premier League with the club in 2011. He was dismissed with the club in a precarious position and joined [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] (2012–2013). After being dismissed by Leeds following a poor run of form, he was without a club for almost fifteen months until returning to Crystal Palace, then in the Premier League, in August 2014. In December 2014, he was dismissed by Crystal Palace after a poor start to the season, which saw the club in the relegation zone.<ref name="BBCSport">{{Cite news |date=27 December 2014 |title=Neil Warnock: Crystal Palace sack manager after Southampton defeat |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30610309 |access-date=27 December 2014}}</ref> After a month as caretaker at Queens Park Rangers,<ref name="BBCSportQPR">{{Cite news |date=4 December 2015 |title=Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink: QPR appoint Burton manager as boss |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35005002 |access-date=4 December 2015}}</ref> Warnock returned to Rotherham United as manager in February 2016.<ref name="Rotherham">{{Cite news |date=11 February 2016 |title=Neil Warnock named Rotherham manager until end of season |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35541314 |access-date=12 February 2016}}</ref> He was appointed manager of Cardiff City in October 2016, and led them to Premier League promotion during the [[2017-18 EFL Championship|2017–18 season]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=5 October 2016 |title=Cardiff City appoint Neil Warnock as new manager |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/05/cardiff-city-appoint-neil-warnock-new-manager}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Stadium |first=Stuart James at Cardiff City |date=6 May 2018 |title=Cardiff City back in Premier League with Neil Warnock's eighth promotion |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/06/cardiff-city-promoted-to-premier-league-draw-reading}}</ref> Warnock became manager of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in June 2020, a role he held until his departure in November 2021.

==Playing career==
Warnock started his professional playing career with [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in 1967, before moving on to [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool]], [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]], [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], [[York City F.C.|York City]] and [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]], making a total of 327 league appearances in an 11-year playing career.

==Managerial career==
===Early spells===
After being involved in Sunday League coaching, his first full managerial job was with [[Northern Premier League]] side [[Gainsborough Trinity F.C.|Gainsborough Trinity]] in 1981. During his time at Gainsborough, Warnock also played for the club.<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=bostonutdstats |author=Christian James |number=1512765550199545857|date = 9 April 2022 |title=New Trinity boss Neil Warnock lost his first competitive game in management as the Pilgrims progressed in the Lincolnshire Cup. }}</ref> Warnock's Gainsborough side went unbeaten for the first home 13 games of the [[1980–81 Northern Premier League]] season, a streak that was not equalled by the club until 2022.<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=GainsTrinityFC |author=Gainsborough Trinty F.C. |number=1498578636282204162|date = 1 March 2022 |title=New Trinity boss Neil Warnock lost his first competitive game in management as the Pilgrims progressed in the Lincolnshire Cup. }}</ref> Under Warnock's management, Gainsborough finished fifth in the [[Northern Premier League]].<ref>{{FCHD | id = GAINSTRI | name = Gainsborough Trinity }}</ref>

Following this he managed [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] and [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]]. At Scarborough he and [[Paul Evans (football assistant manager)|Paul Evans]], his assistant, won the [[Football Conference]] title in 1987, making them the first team to win automatic promotion to the [[Football League]] following the abolition of the re-election system.

Warnock had earlier spent time as a coach at [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], where he met Posh assistant boss [[Mick Jones (footballer, born 1947)|Mick Jones]]. In late 1988, Warnock became manager of [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] – then in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] – with Jones as his assistant. Also joining the backroom staff were Warnock's assistant at Scarborough, Paul Evans, and ex-Scarborough physio Dave Wilson. The four helped County achieve successive promotions to reach the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] for the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92 season]], with Warnock turning down lucrative offers to manage [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] during this time.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Neil Warnock has no regrets over turning down Chelsea job |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/neil-warnock-has-no-regrets-over-turning-down-chelsea-job-8423466.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220618/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/neil-warnock-has-no-regrets-over-turning-down-chelsea-job-8423466.html |archive-date=18 June 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |date=18 December 2012 |website=The Independent}}</ref> Warnock, however, was dismissed in January 1993 after County's relegation had cost them a place in the new [[Premier League]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=When Saturday Comes – When Neil Warnock led Notts County to a shock season in the top division |url=https://www.wsc.co.uk/stories/14090-when-neil-warnock-led-notts-county-to-a-shock-season-in-the-top-division |last=Naylor |first=Martin |website=www.wsc.co.uk |language=en-GB |access-date=29 May 2020}}</ref>

On 1 February 1993, Warnock arrived at [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] as "consultant", where he was brought in to assist the team manager, Paul Compton.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|date=1993|title=Scouting Trip for Gulls Duo|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001329/19930201/024/0024|access-date=22 January 2024|website=British Newspaper Archive|publisher=Torbay Express and South Devon Echo}}</ref> On 24 March 1993, Warnock officially took over as manager following the resignation of Compton, who reverted to his previous role of youth coach.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|date=1993|title=Compton Goes Back to the Youth Team|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001329/19930325/048/0048|access-date=22 January 2024|website=British Newspaper Archive|publisher=Torbay Express and South Devon Echo}}</ref>

After saving the club from relegation from the Football League, Warnock left the club in May 1993 and was replaced by Don O'Riordan. Soon afterwards Warnock turned down the job at Lincoln City.

===Huddersfield Town===
Warnock resumed his partnership with Jones, Evans and Wilson at [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], his appointment coming in July 1993 where he replaced Ian Ross, who had departed Leeds Road one day previously. His arrival at the club coincided with Huddersfield's final season at Leeds Road, which had been their home since their formation in 1908. 

Warnock quickly injected new blood into the side, signing goalkeeper [[Steve Francis (footballer)|Steve Francis]], [[Darren Bullock]], [[Ronnie Jepson]], [[Tom Cowan]] and [[Pat Scully]] during his first season, all of whom would go on to become mainstays in the 1994–95 promotion season. He also showed faith in Centre of Excellence products such as [[Chris Billy]], [[Simon Baldry]] and [[Andy Booth]] – a player then struggling to make the breakthrough who would go on to become a club legend in modern times. 

Despite these acquisitions, Town struggled for most of the 1993–94 season and Warnock was quick to offload fan favourites [[Iwan Roberts]], [[Iffy Onoura]] and [[Chris Marsden]] while introducing a more direct style of play. He was deeply unpopular during those early months of his reign and it wasn't until the run to the [[1994 Football League Trophy Final]] (lost on penalties to [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]]) that opinions began to change. This run coincided with an upturn in league form and a mass optimism further bolstered by the move to the new [[Galpharm Stadium|Alfred McAlpine Stadium]] for the 1994–95 season. 

Warnock's side won the Yorkshire Electricity Cup in late 1994 and were genuine contenders for automatic promotion until falling away in the final few games to finish 5th (the final play-off spot that season owing to league re-structuring). They triumphed on penalties over second-placed [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] after two thrilling ties and went on to beat [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. He quit Huddersfield just days after their promotion, but made a swift and surprising return to management at [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], who had just been relegated to Division Three.

===Plymouth Argyle===
In his first season as manager of Plymouth Argyle, Warnock took the club to Division Three play-off glory after finishing fourth in the league. The play-off semi-final was a memorable affair – Argyle played Colchester United and were 1–0 down from the first leg, but won 3–1 at Home Park in the second leg. During this game, Warnock was sent off from the dug-out. Warnock responded to this by jumping into the crowd to watch the remainder of the match with the Argyle supporters.

The final was the first match that the club had played at Wembley. A header from Ronnie Mauge on 65 minutes gave Argyle a 1–0 win over Darlington and promotion to Division Two. In February 1997, Warnock was surprisingly sacked as Argyle manager despite his popularity with the supporters. Following this successful spell, Warnock rounded out the 1990s with two relegations, first at [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in the 1996–97 season,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Division One Table 1996-97 |url=https://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?tourn_id=210 |website=Soccerbase}}</ref> and then in 1998–99 at [[Bury F.C.|Bury]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Division One Table 1998-99 |url=https://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?tourn_id=208 |website=Soccerbase}}</ref>

===Sheffield United===
[[File:Neil Warnock.jpg|left|thumb|Warnock coaching Sheffield United in 2003]]
Warnock was appointed as manager of his boyhood club [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on 2 December 1999. In [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03]], Warnock led Sheffield United to the semi-finals of the [[2002–03 Football League Cup|League Cup]] and [[2002–03 FA Cup|FA Cup]], only to lose to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]<ref>{{Cite news |date=21 January 2003 |title=Liverpool conquer brave Blades |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/2675751.stm}}</ref> and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]<ref>{{Cite news |date=13 April 2003 |title=Arsenal sink brave Blades |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/2917575.stm}}</ref> respectively, as well as the [[2003 Football League First Division playoff final|First Division play-off final]], with the Blades beaten 3–0 by [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=26 May 2003 |title=Wolves back in big time |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/3050993.stm}}</ref> This was the first time in his management career that he had lost a play-off contest, as he had achieved four promotions via the playoffs in the 1990s.

In 2005, Jones resumed the partnership by taking up the assistant's post at [[Bramall Lane]], and at the end of the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06 season]], the club were promoted to the Premier League as runners-up in [[Football League Championship|The Championship]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=15 April 2006 |title=Blades promoted after Leeds draw |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/4912522.stm}}</ref>

The Blades performed well in their expected relegation battle, and for a long time looked to be heading for survival. However, a turning point in the season occurred with victories for both [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] on the final day of the season, condemning Warnock's side to relegation. Warnock wrote in his autobiography that minutes after the final game of the season, actor and ''Blades'' fan [[Sean Bean]] burst into his office, blaming Warnock for the team's relegation in a "foul-mouthed tirade" while Warnock's wife and daughter were present. Bean denied this, calling Warnock "bitter" and "hypocritical", and arguing that he would never use such language in front of another man's wife and children. Warnock resigned from the club following relegation to take some time out of football.<ref>{{Cite news |date=16 May 2007 |title=Warnock resigns as Blades manager |work=BBC Sport |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/6659513.stm}}</ref>

A major factor that caused Sheffield United's relegation was that West Ham beat Manchester United on the final day of the season 1–0, with the goal scored by [[Carlos Tevez]], whose contract was in question over third party ownership and who then signed for the champions the very next season. While all of this was happening, the Blades played Wigan at Bramall Lane and needed only one point to stay up; however, with the score at 1–1, a penalty was awarded to Wigan in injury time at the end of the first half – David Unsworth converted. The scoreline remained the same till the final whistle, sending the Blades back to the Championship after only one season.<ref>{{Cite news |date=14 May 2007 |title=Sheff Utd 1–2 Wigan |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6627849.stm}}</ref>

===Crystal Palace===
[[File:Neil Warnock Crystal Palace.png|thumb|140px|Warnock with Palace]]
Warnock spoke to [[Milan Mandarić]] about the vacant managerial role at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in the summer, but was never handed the job.<ref name="Made in Sheffield: Neil Warnock - My Story 343-344">{{Cite book |last=Warnock |first=Neil |title=Made in Sheffield: Neil Warnock – My Story |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-340-93721-1 |pages=343–344 |chapter=Moving on to Palace}}</ref> [[Simon Jordan]] spoke to Warnock about taking over at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] following the sacking of [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] and, after initially not being keen over the job, he returned to football management with Palace on 11 October 2007.<ref name="Made in Sheffield: Neil Warnock - My Story 346">{{Cite book |last=Warnock |title=Made in Sheffield: Neil Warnock – My Story |page=346}}</ref><ref name="Warnock appointed as Palace boss">{{Cite news |date=11 October 2007 |title=Warnock appointed as Palace boss |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/7037569.stm |access-date=11 October 2007}}</ref> Having his personal friend Simon Jordan as owner and chairman was certainly a help in him getting the job. Jones returned from his own sabbatical to join Warnock's team as assistant. Under Warnock and Jones, Palace made a massive turn-around, moving from relegation battlers to promotion contenders in the space of six months, with Warnock's use of youngsters a major factor in the improved performances and results. Palace made the play-offs in the end, but were beaten at the semi-final stage by [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]],<ref>{{Cite news |date=13 May 2008 |title=Bristol C 2–1 C Palace (agg 4–2) |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/7393740.stm}}</ref> who went on to lose to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] in the final.

Warnock stayed on for the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09 season]], but on taking the job a year earlier he had made it clear that the Crystal Palace job would be his last managerial role in football, with the club's finances beginning to take a turn for the worse. The [[2009–10 in English football|2009–10 season]] saw Palace perform well despite being heavily restricted by the club's poor financial position, which resulted in the club being placed in administration late in January. A ten-point deduction was imposed by the Football League for this.<ref>{{Cite news |date=28 January 2010 |title=Crystal Palace deducted 10 points |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/8484824.stm |access-date=1 March 2010}}</ref> Crystal Palace's administrator commented that Warnock was "let go" after telling the administrator he did not have the stomach for the fight to save the club.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ashdown |first=John |date=3 March 2010 |title=Keith Alexander RIP, and England's martyr |work=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/mar/03/the-fiver-keith-alexander |access-date=20 May 2010}}</ref>

===Queens Park Rangers===
On 1 March 2010, Warnock joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] as manager on a three-and-a-half-year deal after agreeing compensation with Crystal Palace.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2 March 2010 |title=Neil Warnock is named manager of Queens Park Rangers |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/q/qpr/8544436.stm |access-date=1 March 2010}}</ref> His first match in charge was an emphatic 3–1 home win against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=6 March 2010 |title=QPR 3–1 West Brom |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/8548140.stm}}</ref>

He helped QPR comfortably avoid relegation in 2009–10 – including a 2–0 win against former club Crystal Palace at [[Selhurst Park]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=10 April 2010 |title=Crystal Palace 0–2 QPR |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/8607448.stm}}</ref> Warnock was awarded Manager of the Month for August 2010. Using a new 4–2–3–1 formation built around playmaker [[Adel Taarabt]] (who went on to win the Football League Championship Player of the Year 2011), QPR topped the table for the majority of the [[2010–11 Football League Championship|2010–11 season]] and on 30 April 2011 were promoted as Championship champions after a 2–0 win over [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=30 April 2011 |title=Watford 0–2 QPR |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/13174445}}</ref>

Despite leading the club to the Premier League for the first time in 15 years, he was sacked on 8 January 2012 after the 1–2 home defeat to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on 2 January 2012. The owner of QPR, [[Tony Fernandes]], said that the club slipped down to a dangerous league position (17th) after recent results.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Warnock said, "Obviously I'm very disappointed but, having achieved so much, I leave the club with a great sense of pride. I have enjoyed my time here more than anywhere else and the QPR fans have been brilliant with me – they deserve success. My biggest regret is that the takeover didn't happen earlier, because that would have given me the opportunity to bring in the targets I'd pinpointed all last summer and probably given us a better chance to succeed in the Premier League. The board at QPR are hugely ambitious and I wish them every success for the future. I've been involved in the game a long time and I will be spending the immediate future with my family and friends before deciding my next career move."<ref>{{Cite web |title=QPR sack Warnock |url=https://www.eurosport.com/football/premier-league/2011-2012/qpr-sack-warnock_sto3096388/story.shtml |date=8 January 2012 |website=Eurosport |access-date=19 February 2012}}</ref>

Leeds would go on to finish 14th in the Championship, and during the summer of 2012, Warnock revamped the entire Leeds team with several new signings. Warnock started the 2012–13 season with a home win in the League Cup beating [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] 4–0.<ref>{{Cite news |date=11 August 2012 |title=Leeds 4–0 Shrewsbury |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19123956}}</ref> Leeds would then go on to beat Wolves 1–0 at Elland Road on the opening day of the Championship.<ref>{{Cite news |date=18 August 2012 |title=Leeds 1–0 Wolves |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19221635}}</ref>

===Rotherham United===
On 11 February 2016, Neil Warnock was confirmed as the new Rotherham United manager for the remainder of the 2015–16 season, replacing Neil Redfearn.<ref name="Rotherham" /> Warnock drew his first game in charge with a 0–0 draw against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in a match which saw both [[Richard Wood (footballer)|Richard Wood]] and [[Joe Mattock]] sent off.

To hell with the rest of the world."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hills |first=David |date=12 January 2019 |title=Neil Warnock on Brexit: 'I can't wait to leave.
