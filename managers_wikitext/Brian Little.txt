'''Brian Little''' (born 25 November 1953) is an English [[Association football|football]] manager and former player.

As a player, Little was a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] who spent his entire career for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in a career that spanned from 1971 to 1980. He made 247 league appearances, scoring 60 goals and earning a single cap for [[England national football team|England]] in 1975. As a player he won the [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] on two occasions in 1975 and 1977.

As a manager he has been in charge of [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and  [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]] before taking a job in with [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], during his tenure he secured promotion to the [[Premier League]] by winning the play-offs in 1994. He was then appointed as manager of fellow top flight side Aston Villa where he went on to win the Football League Cup in 1996. He had later spells in charge of [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]], [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]], [[Gainsborough Trinity F.C.|Gainsborough Trinity]] and [[Jersey official football team|Jersey]].

==Playing career==
On leaving school in May 1969, Little signed for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] who would be relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] for the first and only time in their history the following season. 

Little played a full season for the Aston Villa Youth side and subsequently made his senior debut on 30 October 1971, in a 4–1 win over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in the Third Division at [[Villa Park]]. He only made two senior appearances that season but was a key player in Villa's [[FA Youth Cup]] winning side of 1972. By [[1973–74 in English football|1973–74]], with Villa in the Second Division, he was a regular first team player.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brian Little|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/brian-little-5347/biography-1975_a11824/|work=Sporting Heroes|access-date=23 April 2013}}</ref> He made 247 appearances for the club and scored 60 goals, and made one full international appearance for [[England national football team|England]] in 1975.

He was part of Villa's [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] winning teams of 1975 and 1977, scoring two goals in the second replay victory over Everton in the latter final, as well as helping the club climb from the Third to [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in the early part of the decade, scoring 20 league goals in the [[1974–75 in English football|1974–75 season]] when they were runners-up and clinched promotion to the First Division. His playing career came to a halt in 1980 when he retired at the age of 26 due to a knee injury.

Ironically , the previous year it was a congenital spinal defect that was detected in x-rays when Little was undergoing a medical at Villa's local rivals [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. This meant his intended transfer there was cancelled. He was a flamboyant forward who formed a particularly prolific partnership with [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1955)|Andy Gray]]. Little is regarded as an all-time great at [[Villa Park]], and in 2007 he was named as one of the 12 founder members of the [[Aston Villa Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news|date=28 June 2007|url=http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HallOfFame/0,,10265,00.html|title=Aston Villa – Hall of Fame|publisher=Aston Villa Official Website|access-date=28 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015041500/http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HallOfFame/0%2C%2C10265%2C00.html|archive-date=15 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Coaching and managerial career==
Although his playing career was over, Little remained on the Aston Villa payroll as youth team coach. When manager [[Tony Barton (footballer)|Tony Barton]] was sacked in the summer of 1984, Little's contract was also terminated and he became first-team coach of [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
Brian Little was appointed [[caretaker manager]] of Wolverhampton Wanderers on 31 August 1986 as successor to [[Sammy Chapman]]. His appointment came at the end of the blackest spell in the club's history, when three successive relegations had dragged them from the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] to the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth]]. He oversaw a steady start to the [[1986–87 in English football|1986–87 season]] before [[Graham Turner]] was appointed manager 36 days later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wolves Managers|url=http://www.thesackrace.com/teams/wolverhampton-wanderers/|work=The Sack Race|access-date=23 April 2013}}</ref>

===Middlesbrough===
Shortly after leaving Wolverhampton, Little was recruited as a first team coach by [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] manager [[Bruce Rioch]]. Like Wolves, Middlesbrough were a financially troubled club and had narrowly escaped bankruptcy. Little was an important part of the club's coaching staff as Middlesbrough's form improved, and with two successive promotions they were in the First Division for the [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]] season. The season ended in relegation for Middlesbrough but in February Little left the [[Ayresome Park]] coaching staff and became manager of [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]].

===Darlington===
Darlington were bottom of the [[English Football League|Football League]] in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. He was unable to prevent them from getting relegated to the [[National League (division)|Conference]] but they were promoted back into the League at the first time of asking. [[1990–91 in English football|1990–91]] brought more success for Little and Darlington as they won the Fourth Division championship, and by this stage he was on the radar of bigger clubs looking to appoint a new manager.

===Leicester City===
In June 1991, [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] appointed Little as their replacement for [[Gordon Lee (footballer)|Gordon Lee]]. The Foxes had just avoided relegation to the Third and Little was chosen as the man to turn the club's fortunes around. They emerged as promotion contenders in his first season in charge at [[Filbert Street]].

At the end of 1991–92, Leicester came fourth in the Second Division and qualified for the promotion playoffs, the winners securing a place in the new [[Premier League]]. They overcame [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] in the semi-finals and were drawn with [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in the final. But their promotion hopes were dashed when Blackburn striker [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]], a former Leicester player, scored a penalty which took the [[Lancashire]] side into the new league. At the end of the [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93]] season, Leicester qualified for the playoffs again in the new Division One. They overcame [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in the semi-finals but in the final were 3–0 down shortly after half-time to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]]. They fought back to bring the scoreline to 3–3, however Swindon scored a controversial late fourth goal from the penalty spot to progress to the [[Premier League]].

In [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94]], however, Leicester won their third consecutive play-offs with a 2–1 win in the final against East Midlands rivals [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. This was Leicester's first win in a Wembley final after seven attempts, and took them back into the top flight after a seven-year absence.

In November 1994, following the dismissal of Aston Villa manager [[Ron Atkinson]], Little was linked with a return to [[Villa Park]] as manager. Leicester, meanwhile, were struggling among the elite and they went on to be relegated in second from bottom place, with just six league wins all season. With Villa yet to appoint a successor to Atkinson, Little resigned as Leicester manager later that month.

Earlier in the year, former Middlesbrough youth coach Little had been linked with a return to the [[Teesside]] club as manager following the departure of [[Lennie Lawrence]], but the job went to [[Bryan Robson]] instead.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lawrence leaves Middlesbrough|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-lawrence-leaves-middlesbrough-1433290.html|work=The Telegraph|access-date=23 April 2013|location=London|first=Phil|last=Shaw|date=3 May 1994}}</ref>

===Aston Villa===
Within days of quitting Leicester, Little was confirmed as Villa's new manager. 
Villa had finished runners-up in the first Premier League 18 months earlier, but were now in the relegation battle. A 1–1 draw with relegated [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on the last day of the season meant Villa's relegation battle had been won.

Under Little, young players like [[Mark Bosnich]] (179) and [[Ugo Ehiogu]] (237) were now getting more first team chances, but Villa also made a large number of new signings between [[1994-95 avfc|November 1994 and August 1995]], including [[Ian Taylor (footballer, born 1968)|Ian Taylor]] (233), [[Mark Draper]] (120), [[Gary Charles]] (107) and [[Savo Milošević]] (90). The revamped, younger Villa team gelled well, and [[1995–96 in English football|1995–96]] was a successful season at [[Villa Park]]. The club finished fourth in the Premiership, reached the [[FA Cup]] semi-finals and won the [[Football League Cup]] with a 3–0 win over [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], securing [[UEFA Cup]] qualification for the fourth time in six seasons.

Villa qualified for the [[1996–97 in English football|1996–97]] [[UEFA Cup]] and although they were knocked out at the first stage by Swedish side [[Helsingborgs IF|Helsingborg]], they qualified for the [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]] competition after finishing fifth in the Premiership. [[1997-98 avfc|In February 1998]], Little resigned after just over three years as Aston Villa manager, with the club in the bottom half of the Premiership. His successor [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]] turned things around, with a seventh place finish clinching a UEFA Cup place.

===Stoke City===
Little was appointed manager of [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in May 1998, just after their relegation to Division Two.<ref name="Stoke City Modern Era">{{cite book|last=Lowe|first=Simon|title=Stoke City The Modern Era – A Complete Record|year=2000|publisher=Desert Island Books|isbn=1-874287-39-2}}</ref> Little arrived with the only objective was to gain an instant return to the First Division in [[1998–99 Stoke City F.C. season|1998–99]]. Stoke began the season in fine form winning 14 of their first 20 matches and they looked well placed for automatic promotion.<ref name="Stoke City Modern Era"/> However their form completely fell away after Christmas and won just seven matches from the remaining 26 and ended up finishing in 8th position. One of those defeats was a 2–0 loss against nine-men [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], which Little described as "the worst result in my twelve years in management".<ref name="Stoke City Modern Era"/> In July 1999 Little resigned and stated: "I have tried my best and the disappointment is very hard to take. I hope the supporters understand that it's best that I leave".<ref name="Stoke City Modern Era"/>

===West Bromwich Albion===
Little made a quick return to management when he was appointed manager of [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]. The club were languishing in Division One and had been outside the top division since 1986, but continued to struggle in the league under Little.

In January 2000 the promising Italian midfielder [[Enzo Maresca]] was transferred to [[Juventus]] for £4 million as Albion battled against relegation. Little was sacked in March 2000 after just eight months in charge and replaced by [[Gary Megson]], who guided Albion to promotion two years later.

===Hull City===
In April 2000, just one month after leaving [[the Hawthorns]], Little was appointed manager of Division Three strugglers [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. The Tigers were hit by huge debts and were locked out of [[Boothferry Park]] for one game by the landlord, former tennis player [[David Lloyd (tennis player)|David Lloyd]]. By the end of the 2000–01 season, Hull had been saved from closure by new owner [[Adam Pearson (sports executive)|Adam Pearson]], and the club's future looked brighter. They reached the Division Three playoffs, but lost to [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] in the semi-finals.

In autumn 2001, following the dismissal of manager [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]], media reports suggested that Little was going to be approached by [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] about a possible second spell as manager, but the job went to [[Dave Bassett]] instead.<ref>{{cite news|title=Who's next for the Foxes hot-seat?|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/1573145.stm|work=BBC Sport|access-date=23 April 2013|date=1 October 2001}}</ref> By February 2002 Hull City looked well on course for automatic promotion from Division Three. But Little unexpectedly announced his resignation from the club,<ref>{{cite news|date=28 February 2002|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/1845418.stm|title=Tigers stay tight-lipped |publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=28 June 2007}}</ref> and under his successor [[Jan Mølby]], the club's fortunes slipped dramatically and they could not even finish high enough for a play-off place.

===Tranmere Rovers===
In October 2003, Little made a return to football management with [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]], who were in [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]].<ref>{{cite news|date=12 October 2003|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/t/tranmere_rovers/3185708.stm|title=Tranmere appoint Little|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=28 June 2007}}</ref>

His first season with the [[Merseyside]] club was a success. When he took over they were battling against relegation. But by the end of the season they had climbed up to eighth place and had reached the quarter finals of the [[FA Cup]]. He won the Second Division manager of the month award for April 2004.<ref>{{cite news|date=3 May 2004|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/t/tranmere_rovers/3679783.stm|title=Little named top boss |publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=28 June 2007}}</ref> In his first full season as manager, he guided Tranmere to a third-place finish in [[Football League One|League One]] but they lost in the playoffs to miss out on promotion.

Tranmere began 2005–06 as League One promotion favourites, but at the turn of 2006 they were facing a relegation battle. The club only avoided relegation with one game to go and, due to the club's poor finishing position in League One, he left the club by mutual consent on 5 May 2006.<ref>{{cite news|date=5 May 2006|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tranmere_rovers/4976782.stm|title=Tranmere boss Little steps down |publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=28 June 2007}}</ref>

===Wrexham===
Out-of-work Little was linked with a return to management with both [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] and [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/gossip_and_transfers/7019468.stm|title=Saturday's gossip column|date=29 September 2007|work=BBC Sport|access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/gossip_and_transfers/7015587.stm|title=Thursday's gossip column|date=27 September 2007|work=BBC Sport|access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref> However, in November 2007, Little took the reins at [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]], replacing [[Brian Carey]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Little confirmed as Wrexham boss|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wrexham/7092852.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 November 2007|access-date=15 November 2007}}</ref> With five games remaining in the season the club were in the relegation zone, seven points off safety. They were relegated to the Conference on 22 April 2008 after a 2–0 loss at Hereford United. However, Little signed a two-year contract, promising to revive the club's fortunes.<ref>{{Cite news|title= Little signs new Wrexham contract|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/wrexham/7342829.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 April 2008|access-date=11 April 2008}}</ref>

The 2008-09 season started well, with a 5–0 home victory against [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage Borough]], another team expected to challenge for promotion. however, a run of poor results followed, with Wrexham being left in the mid-table battle, only four points above the relegation zone and only keeping two clean sheets all season. Following a 3–0 home defeat against [[Rushden & Diamonds F.C.|Rushden & Diamonds]], Little left Wrexham by mutual consent.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wrexham/7639510.stm |title=Little parts company with Wrexham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 September 2008}}</ref>

===Gainsborough Trinity===
On 28 August 2009, Little was appointed manager of [[Conference North]] side [[Gainsborough Trinity F.C.|Gainsborough Trinity]]. The club had moved to appoint him following the recent dismissal of manager [[Steve Charles (footballer)|Steve Charles]] and the resignation of his coaching staff which included formerly appointed caretaker managers [[Dave Reeves]] and [[Steve Blatherwick]]. However, Little would not take charge of the club's away fixture the following day against [[Farsley Celtic F.C.|Farsley Celtic]] after it was announced he would not take over from player/caretaker manager [[Adie Moses]] until 7 September.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsecho.co.uk/nonleague/gainsboroughtrinity/Brian-Little-new-Gainsborough-Trinity-manager/article-1294145-detail/article.html |title=Brian Little named Gainsborough Trinity manager |date=28 August 2009 |publisher=Sports Echo |access-date=28 August 2009}}</ref> Little began building a squad of professionals at Trinity, picking up many players from the [[Football League]] and other ex-League players from the [[Conference National]], but despite boasting a large squad of experienced players Trinity narrowly avoided relegation to the [[Northern Premier League]] during the 2010–11 season. On 22 August 2011 following one win and two defeats in the opening weeks of the 2011–12 season, Little was sacked as manager of Trinity with [[Steve Housham]] taking over as caretaker manager.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gainsborough Trinity sack Little|url=http://www.gainsboroughpeople.co.uk/Gainsborough-Trinity-sack-Little/story-13180503-detail/story.html|work=Gainsborough People|access-date=23 April 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214051855/http://www.gainsboroughpeople.co.uk/Gainsborough-Trinity-sack-Little/story-13180503-detail/story.html|archive-date=14 December 2013}}</ref>
