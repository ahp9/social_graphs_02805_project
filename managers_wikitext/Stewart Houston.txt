'''Stewart Mackie Houston''' (born 20 August 1949) is a Scottish former [[association football|football]] player and [[coach (sports)|coach]] who played as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left-back]]. Born in [[Dunoon]], he began his professional career in 1967 with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], before moving to [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] and then [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], where he spent seven years. He also made one appearance for the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]] in 1975.

He was [[George Graham]]'s assistant at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and caretaker manager after the sackings of Graham and his replacement [[Bruce Rioch]], and later manager of [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. He then had spells as the first-team coach at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]. Houston later worked as a scout for Arsenal.<ref name="barclay">{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/patrick-barclay-dare-to-dream-arsenal-fans-momentum-has-to-start-somewhere-10068630.html |title=Dare to dream, Arsenal fans, momentum has to start somewhere |work=Evening Standard |date=25 February 2015 |access-date=18 June 2015 |first=Patrick |last=Barclay |quote=I was at the [[Stade Louis II]] in 2004 and afterwards, in a hotel nearby, met the former Arsenal manager Stewart Houston, who was one of two scouts Wenger had sent — one to watch [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] and the other their opponents, [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].}}</ref><ref name="haynes">[https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/danny-in-gunners-sights-729754 Haynes in Arsenal's sights]</ref>

==Career==
A [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left back]], Houston's first professional club was [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], but he failed to break into the first team and only made 14 appearances in five years. He was sold to [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in 1972.{{Sfn|White|1989|p=285-288}} A year later he signed for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for £55,000, where he made 250 appearances (plus two as substitute) and scored 16 goals.

While he was at [[Old Trafford]], Houston helped United win the [[Football League Second Division]] in [[1974-75 in English football|1975]] and the [[1976–77 FA Cup]], although he did not feature in the [[1977 FA Cup Final]]. He joined [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in 1980, before ending his playing career with [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] in 1986. He also played international football for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], making one appearance in 1975 against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].<ref>{{SFA Profile|id=113794}}</ref>

Houston was assistant manager to [[George Graham (footballer, born 1944)|George Graham]] at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1990, and was twice the club's caretaker-manager: first for three months in 1995 after Graham's sacking in February 1995. Houston took his team to the final of the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], but the Gunners lost to a last-minute goal from [[Nayim]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/extraordinary-nayim-strike-denies-arsenal-1619106.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220525/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/extraordinary-nayim-strike-denies-arsenal-1619106.html |archive-date=25 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Extraordinary Nayim strike denies Arsenal |first=Glenn |last=Moore |work=The Independent |date=11 May 1995 |access-date=18 June 2015}}</ref>

Arsenal appointed [[Bruce Rioch]] in the summer of 1995, but Houston stayed on as his assistant. Just over a year after his appointment, Rioch was sacked, and Houston was reappointed as caretaker. [[Arsène Wenger]] was identified as Rioch's successor in August, but Arsenal were forced to wait as Wenger was contracted to Japanese club [[Nagoya Grampus Eight|Grampus Eight]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/arsenal-made-to-wait-for-wenger-1310660.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220525/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/arsenal-made-to-wait-for-wenger-1310660.html |archive-date=25 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Arsenal made to wait for Wenger |work=The Independent |date=21 August 1996 |access-date=18 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/arsenal-still-waiting-on-wenger-1362864.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220525/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/arsenal-still-waiting-on-wenger-1362864.html |archive-date=25 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Arsenal still waiting on Wenger |work=The Independent |date=11 September 1996 |access-date=18 June 2015}}</ref> Houston left Arsenal in mid-September to become manager of [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/houston-has-new-mission-as-wenger-replaces-him-1.435639 |title=Houston has new mission as Wenger replaces him |work=The Herald |publisher=Herald & Times Group |date=17 September 1996 |access-date=18 June 2015}}</ref> where he appointed Bruce Rioch as his assistant. QPR had just been relegated to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and were aiming for a return to the [[Premier League]]. Houston and Rioch were sacked by QPR in November 1997, with the club sitting 13th in the First Division.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-queens-park-rangers-dismiss-houston-and-rioch-1293477.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220525/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-queens-park-rangers-dismiss-houston-and-rioch-1293477.html |archive-date=25 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Football: Queen's Park Rangers dismiss Houston and Rioch |work=The Independent |date=11 November 1997 |access-date=18 June 2015}}</ref>

Houston then went to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] as [[George Burley]]'s first team coach, but was later reunited with George Graham in March 1999 when Graham appointed him assistant manager at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. Houston was fired two years later. <Ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/1251082.stm |title=Spurs show Houston the door |date=30 March 2001 }}</ref> after Graham was sacked in March 2001. He then spent a brief period as first-team coach of [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]. Houston also worked as a scout for Arsenal from 2008 to 2020.<Ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/2010908/2020/08/20/arsenal-pat-rice-stewart-houston/ |title=Pat Rice and Stewart Houston lose scouting roles at Arsenal }}</ref><ref name="barclay"/><ref name="haynes"/>
