'''Michael Carrick''' (born 28 July 1981) is an English professional [[Association football|football]] coach and former player who was most recently the head coach of {{English football updater|Middboro}} club [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. He is known for his 12-year playing career with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], whom he also [[Captain (association football)|captained]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/10381166/Michael-Carrick-the-king-of-control-takes-possession-for-England-and-shows-his-worth.html|title=Michael Carrick the king of control takes possession for England and shows his worth|first=Jeremy|last=Wilson|date=15 October 2013|website=The Telegraph|access-date=28 August 2019}}</ref> Carrick was a [[defensive midfielder]], but he was used as an emergency [[centre-back]] under [[Alex Ferguson]], [[David Moyes]], [[Louis van Gaal]] and [[José Mourinho]]. Regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation, his playing style was grounded in his passing ability.<ref name="Carrick sweet on Keane">{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.com/article/carrick-sweet-on-keanes-no-16-in-new-look-united-3jgdtgplptk |title=Carrick sweet on Keane's No 16 in new-look United |first=Oliver |last=Kay |newspaper=[[The Times]] |location=London |date=3 August 2006 |access-date=27 September 2024 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240927124829/https://www.thetimes.com/article/carrick-sweet-on-keanes-no-16-in-new-look-united-3jgdtgplptk |archive-date=27 September 2024}}</ref><ref name="smooth">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/apr/13/michael-carrick-manchester-united-barney-ronay-louis-van-gaal-manchester-city-midfield-blog |title=Manchester United's Michael Carrick: so smooth he plays in a dinner jacket |first=Barney |last=Ronay |date=13 April 2015 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>

Carrick began his career at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], joining the youth team in 1997 and winning the [[FA Youth Cup]] two years later. He was sent on loan twice during his debut season, to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] and [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], before securing a place in the first team by the 2000–01 season. He experienced relegation in the 2002–03 season and was voted into the [[PFA Team of the Year|PFA First Division Team of the Year]] in the following campaign. He made more than 150 appearances for ''the Hammers'', and in 2004, he moved to rival London club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a fee believed to be [[Pound sterling|£]]3.5&nbsp;million. He played an influential role at the club for two seasons before moving to Manchester United in 2006 for £14&nbsp;million.

From his debut onwards, Carrick was a regular in the Manchester United first team, making more than 50 appearances in his first season with them. He established himself as a key member of the team that won the Premier League in [[2006–07 FA Premier League|2006–07]], their first title success in four years. The following season he was part of the side that won the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|2008 Champions League final]], playing the full 120 minutes as they enjoyed a 6–5 penalty shootout win, with Carrick converting his spot kick, to help achieve the [[Double (association football)#European Doubles|European Double]]. As of 2024, he is one of only two English players alongside former teammate [[Wayne Rooney]] to win the [[Premier League]] title, [[FA Cup]], [[UEFA Champions League]], [[EFL Cup|League Cup]], [[FA Community Shield]], [[UEFA Europa League]] and [[FIFA Club World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40074199 |title=Michael Carrick: Man Utd midfielder agrees new one-year deal |date=27 May 2017 |work=BBC Sport}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/sg/news/carrick-hungry-add-super-cup-trophy-cabinet |title=Carrick hungry to add Super Cup to trophy cabinet |date=8 August 2017 |work=FourFourTwo |access-date=12 August 2017 |archive-date=13 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181013172503/https://www.fourfourtwo.com/sg/news/carrick-hungry-add-super-cup-trophy-cabinet |url-status=dead }}</ref> In winning the [[2016 FA Cup Final|2016 FA Cup]], Carrick completed his collection of every domestic honour in the English game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2016/Aug/michael-carrick-reflects-on-10-year-anniversary-of-debut.aspx |title=Carrick reflects on 10-year anniversary |publisher=Manchester United F.C.}}</ref>

Carrick has represented England at [[England national under-18 football team|under-18]], [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]], [[England national football B team|B]] and [[England national football team|senior]] levels. He made his England debut in 2001 and went on to gain 34 caps without scoring a goal. Carrick was often overlooked during his England career, with many of his contemporaries being preferred in his position. This was the case until the 2012–13 season, when Carrick established himself as a regular. He was a member of the England squad for two major tournaments, the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]s.

At the start of the 2011–12 season, Carrick for the second season in a row was a shock starter at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] for the [[2011 FA Community Shield]]. After initially being ruled out through injury by Alex Ferguson in the pre-match build-up, Carrick was named in the starting 11 for the game on 7 August 2011.

As a result of a defensive injury crisis at the club, Carrick started the 2012–13 season as a makeshift centre-back.
