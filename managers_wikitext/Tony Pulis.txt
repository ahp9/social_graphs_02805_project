'''Anthony Richard Pulis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|juː|l|ɪ|s}}; born 16 January 1958) is a Welsh former professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Association football|footballer]] who last managed [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].

Pulis obtained his [[The Football Association|FA]] coaching badge at age 19, followed by his [[UEFA]] 'A' licence aged 21 – making him one of the youngest professional players ever to have obtained the qualification.<ref name='vital'/> His son, [[Anthony Pulis|Anthony]], was a professional footballer and played at Stoke. Pulis had a 17-year career as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] where he played for [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], [[AFC Bournemouth]] and [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]. He also had a short spell in [[Hong Kong]] with [[Happy Valley AA|Happy Valley]].

Pulis took his first steps into management at Bournemouth, where he was a player/coach and then [[Harry Redknapp]]'s assistant.<ref name='vital'/> He then took control when Redknapp left the club.<ref name='vital'/> He then went on to [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] before leaving in 1999 after a dispute with chairman [[Paul Scally]]. Pulis then had unsuccessful spells at [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] before being appointed manager of [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 2002. He guided Stoke through a tough 2002–03 season avoiding relegation to the Second Division on the final day of the season. He spent two more seasons with Stoke before being sacked by Stoke's Icelandic board for "failing to exploit the foreign market". He spent the 2005–06 season at [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] before returning to Stoke along with [[Peter Coates]]. After narrowly missing out on a play-off spot in the 2006–07 season he guided Stoke to the [[Premier League]] in the 2007–08 season by finishing runners-up in the Championship.

With Stoke amongst the favourites for relegation upon their return to the top flight after a 23-year absence, Stoke went on to comfortably survive and finished in 12th position. Pulis made history during the 2010–11 season as he guided Stoke to their first [[FA Cup Final]] after beating [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] 5–0 in the semi-final. The ''Potters'', however, lost the final 1–0 to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], but had the consolation of qualifying for European football. In the [[UEFA Europa League]], Stoke lost 2–0 on aggregate in the round of 32 to Spanish giants [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. The [[2012–13 Stoke City F.C. season|2012–13 season]] saw Stoke make little progress and Pulis left the club by mutual consent on 21 May 2013.

Pulis returned to management on 23 November 2013 joining [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on a two-and-a-half-year contract. He guided Palace away from relegation, to their highest Premier League finish of 11th in [[2013–14 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2013–14]], which earned him the [[Premier League Manager of the Season]] award. He left the club, however, shortly before the start of the subsequent season. He joined [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in January 2015, a post he held until November 2017. Pulis achieved a top half finish with West Brom in the 2016–17 season, finishing 10th, but the club made a poor start to the following season, culminating in his sacking. On Boxing Day 2017, Pulis was appointed manager of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], a post he held until May 2019. On 13 November 2020, Pulis returned to management when he was named manager of Sheffield Wednesday; however, on 28 December, he was sacked after 10 games in charge. Following his sacking, he announced his retirement from football management.

==Playing career==
Pulis began his career at [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] where he joined their school of football excellence in [[Eastville, Bristol|Eastville]] from [[Newport YMCA A.F.C.|Newport YMCA]]. Pulis cites his time at Eastville as an excellent grounding with his Rovers teammate and friend [[Ian Holloway]] also making it in football management. "We learned our trade at a football club with really, really good people who had old fashioned values, I truly believe that it's because of the way we were brought up back then that we have managed to go on and achieve what we have done in the game. The basic principles were drilled into us, both on and off the pitch. Nothing was given to us and we had to work very, very hard for everything we got."<ref>{{cite web|title='Our Excellent Grounding' – Pulis|url=http://origin-www.stokecityfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10310~2240276,00.html|work=Stoke City F.C.|access-date=19 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504205934/http://www.stokecityfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10310~2240276,00.html|archive-date=4 May 2011}}</ref>

Pulis made 85 league appearances for the ''Pirates'' before leaving to join [[Hong Kong]] club [[Happy Valley AA]] in 1982. The club finished second in the [[1981–82 Hong Kong First Division League|Hong Kong First Division League]] and won the [[Hong Kong Senior Challenge Shield]] in his eight-month stint with the club.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Hongkong 1982/83|url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablesh/hk83.html|access-date=2021-02-21|website=Rsssf.com}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Lee |first=David |title=Triffic!

At Newport, Pulis became a popular member of the squad and his former County teammate [[David Giles (footballer)|David Giles]] believes Pulis was always destined for top-level management.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pulis was always destined for top-level management, says former team-mate|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Stoke-boss-Tony-Pulis-was-always-destined-for-top-level-management-says-former-team-mate-article732346.html|work=Daily Mirror|access-date=20 December 2011}}</ref>{{better source needed|reason=tabloid|date=December 2020}}

With County struggling financially, [[Harry Redknapp]] signed Pulis at [[AFC Bournemouth]], spending three years at [[Dean Court]] before joining [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in 1989 for £10,000 on a three-year deal. Gillingham manager [[Damien Richardson (footballer)|Damien Richardson]] had envisaged utilising Pulis as a [[Defender (association football)#Sweeper (libero)|sweeper]] but his time in Kent was blighted by an injury suffered in a pre-season friendly against West Ham, limiting him to just 16 appearances. After contemplating a career outside of football and studying for a small business qualification Pulis returned to Bournemouth a year later for a fee of £15,000 to take up a player/coach role.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lee |title=Triffic! Tony Pulis : his 40 years in football |pages=24–25}}</ref><ref>{{NeilBrownPlayers|player/tonypulis}}</ref> He made 16 appearances, scoring one goal, while in this role.<ref name="vital"/>

==Managerial career==
===AFC Bournemouth===
Pulis was promoted to the position of manager in 1992, following Harry Redknapp's decision to leave the club for [[Premier League]] side [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. Pulis spent two seasons at Bournemouth, both seasons saw the "Cherries" finish in 17th position before moving on.<ref name="vital"/> During his time at the club Pulis spent less than £400,000 on transfers, but recouped nearly £2.7 million in player sales. Among his purchases was [[Steve Fletcher]], signed from [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] for £30,000, who would go on to make a record 728 appearances for the Dorset side across two spells.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Lee |title=Triffic! Tony Pulis : his 40 years in football |pages=28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=3 May 2013 |title=Steve Fletcher: AFC Bournemouth legend announces retirement |language=en-GB |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/22396515 |access-date=2022-11-27}}</ref>

===Gillingham===
Pulis then joined [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in the summer of 1995,<ref name="vital"/> whom he managed for a further four seasons, turning a team that had struggled at the very bottom of the Football League into a promotion winning one in his first season, and laying the foundations for the club's eventual elevation to the First Division for the first time in their history.

In the [[1995–96 Gillingham F.C. season|1995–96]] season the Kent side gained promotion after finishing second behind [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], setting a record for the fewest goals conceded by a team in the course of a 46-game Football League season in the process, with goalkeeper [[Jim Stannard]] keeping 29 clean sheets.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Rothmans Football Yearbook 1996–97 |publisher=[[Headline Publishing Group]] |year=1996 |isbn=978-0747277811 |editor-last=Rollin |editor-first=Glenda |location=London |pages=167 |editor-last2=Rollin |editor-first2=Jack}}</ref> The [[1996–97 Gillingham F.C. season|following season]] Gillingham started poorly, sitting in the relegation places towards the end of 1996, but improved to finish in 11th place and just six points below the promotion play-off places. The [[1997–98 Gillingham F.C. season|1997–98]] season saw further improvement, with the Gills finishing in 8th place and missing out on the play-off places only on the goals-scored rule.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lee |title=Triffic! Tony Pulis : his 40 years in football |pages=33–34}}</ref> 

In the 1999 [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] play-off final, the "Gills" were 2–0 up with less than two minutes left, following goals by the prolific partnership of [[Robert Taylor (footballer, born 1971)|Robert Taylor]] and [[Carl Asaba]], only to see [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] score twice, the equaliser in injury time, and after that win a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty]] shoot-out 3–1.<ref name="TFL">{{Cite web| url = http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/PlayOffsDetail/0,,10794~475418,00.html| title = Play-Off Finals| access-date = 11 April 2007| publisher = The Football League| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070309141237/http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/PlayOffsDetail/0%2C%2C10794~475418%2C00.html| archive-date = 9 March 2007| df = dmy-all}}</ref> Following the defeat, Pulis was controversially sacked by the club amidst claims of gross misconduct.<ref name="vital">{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouth.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=21020|title=Who is Tony Pulis?|publisher=Vital Football|access-date=1 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213203415/http://www.plymouth.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=21020|archive-date=13 December 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> He later brought a £400,000 court case against Gillingham chairman [[Paul Scally]] for unpaid bonuses,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/968357.stm|title=Pulis given Pompey 'leave'|publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | date=12 October 2000 | access-date=6 January 2010}}</ref> which was settled out of court in 2001 for £75,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/1304932.stm|title=End of ills for Gills | publisher=BBC Sport | date=30 April 2001 | access-date=6 January 2010}}</ref>

===Bristol City===
Pulis was appointed manager of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] in July 1999, prior to the start of the [[1999–2000 Bristol City F.C. season|1999–2000 season]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/Records/0,,10327~393170,00.html|title=PAST MANAGERS|publisher=bcfc.com|date=1 February 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010020210/http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/Records/0,,10327~393170,00.html|archive-date=10 October 2011}}</ref> A previous long stint at bitter rivals [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] meant that Pulis's appointment was met with mixed reception. He made several reasonably big purchases including [[Steve Jones (footballer, born March 1970)|Steve Jones]] and former Rovers player [[Peter Beadle]], but his popularity hit an all-time low only six months into his term as manager and when rumours surfaced of a switch to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], home fans chanted for him to leave. He moved on to Portsmouth shortly, where [[Milan Mandarić]] had recently taken over as chairman.

===Portsmouth===
In January 2000, Pulis left Bristol City to become manager of Portsmouth. He took Portsmouth from the bottom three to mid-table but lasted only ten months in the job before being sacked and being replaced by [[Steve Claridge]] in October 2000.<ref name="vital"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/1101002.stm|title=Pulis will fight misconduct charge | publisher=BBC Sport | date=4 January 2001 | access-date=6 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/1099488.stm|title=Pulis sacked by Pompey | publisher=BBC Sport | date=3 January 2001 | access-date=6 January 2010}}</ref>

===Stoke City===
Pulis was then out of work for two years, before the resignation of [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]'s manager [[Steve Cotterill]] early into the [[2002-03 Stoke City F.C. season|2002–03 season]] led to Pulis being given the job that November.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/sports_talk/2379987.stm|title=The right man for Stoke? | publisher=BBC Sport | date=31 October 2002 | access-date=6 January 2010}}</ref> Pulis immediately found himself in a relegation battle and it looked likely that the club would be relegated back to the Second Division only a year after being promoted. Pulis, however, completed the signings of striker [[Ade Akinbiyi]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/3081108.stm|title=Stoke pin hopes on Akinbiyi|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=5 September 2003|access-date=12 June 2007}}</ref> and goalkeeper [[Mark Crossley]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/stats?id=8012&cc=5739|title=1 Mark Crossley|work=[[ESPN Soccernet]]|access-date=12 June 2007|archive-date=16 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716005823/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/stats?id=8012&cc=5739|url-status=dead}}</ref> on loan from [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] respectively, who helped turn around the club's bad run. Stoke avoided relegation on the final day of the [[2002–03 Stoke City F.C. season|2002–03 season]] with a 1–0 win over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] at the [[Britannia Stadium]], with Akinbiyi scoring the only goal of the match.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/2967967.stm|title=Akinbiyi keeps Stoke up|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=4 May 2003|access-date=12 June 2007}}</ref> Pulis rates Stoke's survival in 2002–03 as one of his best achievements in management.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tony Pulis reflects on time at Britannia Stadium|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/20171511|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=23 November 2012}}</ref>

In the following season, [[2003-04 Stoke City F.C. season|2003–04]], Pulis guided the club to an 11th-place finish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/tables?league=eng.2&season=2003&column=none&order=false&cc=5739|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230003643/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/tables?league=ENG.2&season=2003&column=none&order=false&cc=5739|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 December 2006|title=English League Championship Table – 2003/04|work=[[ESPN Soccernet]]|access-date=12 June 2007}}</ref> Tensions grew between the manager and chairman, [[Gunnar Gíslason (businessman)|Gunnar Gíslason]], in the [[2004-05 Stoke City F.C. season|2004–05 season]]. Pulis was frustrated with his lack of transfer funds which led to [[Dave Brammer]] and [[Steve Simonsen]], both of whom were [[free agent]]s, being his only significant signings prior to the start of the season. Pulis, however, did add [[Anthony Pulis]], his son, and [[Lewis Buxton]] to his squad in January 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4059949.stm|title=Transfers – December 2004 | publisher=BBC Sport| date=24 December 2004 | access-date=6 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/stoke_city/4123345.stm|title=Stoke swoop for young Pompey duo|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=24 December 2004 | date=24 December 2004}}</ref> The disagreement between Pulis and the club's Icelandic ownership culminated with Pulis parting company with the club on 28 June 2005.

===Plymouth Argyle===
After a brief spell assisting with training sessions at [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]] (then managed by his friend [[Steve Evans (footballer, born 1962)|Steve Evans]]),<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lee |title=Triffic!

===Return to Stoke City===

Pulis guided Stoke City to promotion to the [[Premier League]] on the final matchday of [[2007–08 Football League Championship|the season]], to be Stoke's first top flight campaign in 23 years. Upon promotion, Pulis admitted the need to strengthen his squad but he also made it clear that the club would not go 'over the top' with spending. Stoke's biggest summer signing was that of striker [[Dave Kitson]], who joined from recently relegated Reading for £5.5&nbsp;million. Kitson was followed by the captures of [[Seyi Olofinjana]] from [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] for £3&nbsp;million, [[Abdoulaye Faye]] from [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for £2.25&nbsp;million, [[Amdy Faye]] from [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] for an undisclosed fee, [[Andrew Davies (footballer)|Andrew Davies]] joined for £1.2&nbsp;million from Southampton, defender [[Ibrahima Sonko]] signed for an initial £2&nbsp;million fee from Reading and former ''Potter'' Danny Higginbotham rejoined his former club from Sunderland for an undisclosed fee. Pulis was also prepared to move players on, including his son Anthony Pulis and striker [[Jon Parkin]].

After a promising start to [[2008–09 Premier League|the Premier League season]], Stoke's mid-season slump left them as one of the favourites for relegation. The January additions of Sheffield United's [[James Beattie (footballer)|James Beattie]] and West Ham winger [[Matthew Etherington]], however, helped rejuvenate their season.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} Stoke dipped in and out of the relegation zone until March, when a good run of form lifted them above the bottom three. Their 2–1 win away to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on 9 May 2009 secured their Premier League survival. Pulis has received much praise for his work with Stoke on a limited budget, in particular his achievement of keeping them in the Premier League. He was mentioned as a possible candidate for the 2008–09 Premier League Manager of the Year award.

[[2009–10 Stoke City F.C. season|The following season]] saw Stoke consolidating their Premier League status rather than facing relegation, and also saw them reach the quarter-finals of the [[2009–10 FA Cup|FA Cup]] with victories over [[York City F.C.|York City]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and Manchester City before losing to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]].

==Style of management==
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=Right|quote="It's simple. If I own an English club, which I don't and which I'd never do, I'd sign Tony Pulis. It's as simple as that. It's a guarantee to achieve what the club wants.

He never managed a club that wants to be champions. He never managed a club that wants a top four place. He's always managed clubs who want to survive and who want stability, and he's mathematic: what the club wants, he gives.

His record is absolutely amazing, and he does what some people don't understand -- but I do -- and what other people sometimes don't rate, but I do. Which is the relation between what the manager wants and what the team is.

Tony's teams are exactly what he wants, exactly what he prepares a team to be. This is the most difficult thing in football. Philosophy is a beautiful thing but football is more than that.
