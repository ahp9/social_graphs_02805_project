'''George Elder Burley''' (born 3 June 1956) is a Scottish former [[association football|football]] player and manager. He had a professional career spanning 21 years as a player, making 628 league appearances and earning 11 Scotland caps. His most successful spell came while at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] making 394 senior appearances, and being part of the squad that won the FA Cup and UEFA Cup in [[1978 FA Cup Final|1978]] and [[1981 UEFA Cup Final|1981]] respectively.

Burley's managerial career began in 1990 with [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]] and has since spent spells at seven different clubs, including an eight-year spell back at Ipswich Town as manager, which included a promotion to the Premier League and guiding the club to a fifth place league finish at that level. On 24 January 2008 he was appointed manager of the [[Scotland men's national football team|Scotland]] national team. He was sacked on 16 November 2009, following a 3–0 defeat to Wales.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/137661-george-burley-sacked-as-scotland-manager/|title=George Burley sacked as Scotland manager|publisher=STV|access-date=16 November 2009|date=16 November 2009|archive-date=18 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118151459/http://sport.stv.tv/football/137661-george-burley-sacked-as-scotland-manager/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Playing career==
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
Burley was born in [[Cumnock]], East Ayrshire.<ref name=worldfootball/> He joined [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in 1972  as an apprentice and won the [[FA Youth Cup]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=17 April 1973|page=34|title=Ipswich skill earns its due reward|last=Malone|first=Roger}}</ref> He made his senior debut against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]] in 1973, being given the job of marking [[George Best]]. In 1978, he was a member of the Ipswich side which upset the odds to defeat [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1–0 in the [[1978 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]]. However, in 1981 injury forced him out of Ipswich's [[UEFA Cup]] final triumph over [[AZ (football club)|AZ Alkmaar]]. Town missed out on the First Division title on the last day of the season, finishing runners-up to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].

In 1985, he joined [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] after making 500 appearances for Ipswich, and was part of the Sunderland team that slipped into the Third Division in 1987, only to win promotion a year later.

He played for [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in the [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89 season]], but was unable to prevent them from being relegated to the Fourth Division. He moved back to Scotland in 1989 to play for [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]].

Burley received eleven [[Scotland men's national football team|Scotland]] caps.<ref>{{SFA Profile|id=11675}}</ref>

==Management career==

===Ayr United===
Burley joined [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]] as a player-manager in 1991, succeeding [[Ally MacLeod]]. In his first season, he took United to the B&Q Centenary Cup Final and again reached the final of the competition (by then renamed the [[Scottish Challenge Cup|B&Q Challenge Cup]]) the following season. However, he did not succeed in taking Ayr back to the Premier League and was dismissed in 1993 for adverse results with the side's place in the First Division in serious jeopardy.

===Motherwell===
Burley moved briefly to [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] in 1993 as a player before returning to [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] as player-coach.

===Colchester United===
In June 1994 Burley returned to [[East Anglia]] as [[player-manager]] of [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]]. He played seven first team games and managed the club for 20 matches, 8 of which they won, before returning to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in December.

===Ipswich Town===
Burley was appointed manager at his former club, with [[Dale Roberts (centre-half)|Dale Roberts]] as his assistant, having had talks with Town without Colchester knowing and so compensation was duly paid.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} He made his playing return for Ipswich, ten years after his last game for the club in a match against [[Motherwell]] in 1995 although didn't feature again as a player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prideofanglia.com/page.php?page=seasons&text=1994-95|title=Pride of Anglia – Ipswich Town Football Club}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prideofanglia.com/page.php?page=playerProfile&last=Burley&first=George|title=Pride of Anglia – Ipswich Town Football Club}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prideofanglia.com/page.php?page=matchReport&level=1&year=1995&month=5&day=15&sequence=0|title=Pride of Anglia – Ipswich Town Football Club}}</ref>

During an eight-year reign he took Ipswich to three play-offs semi finals before finally winning promotion to the [[Premier League]] on the fourth attempt via the [[play-offs]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] beating [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] 4–2.

The following season, he guided the club to fifth place and qualification for the [[UEFA Cup]]. This earned him the 2000–01 [[Premier League Manager of the Season]] award. Relegation the following season saw Burley's side struggling at the foot of [[Football League First Division]] and his contract was terminated by mutual agreement in 2002.

Burley again applied for the job in 2012, losing out to [[Mick McCarthy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=George Burley wants Ipswich Town job|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20082036|work=BBC Sport|access-date=31 May 2017|date=25 October 2012}}</ref> He was later critical of how the club was being run, in 2017, following the club's lowest finishing in nearly 60 years, stating that:<blockquote>The tradition of this club, with what Alf Ramsey, Bobby Robson and even myself achieved shouldn't be forgotten. Right now, Ipswich should be contesting for the top six in the Championship every year at the very least – that's where I think they should be. I was at the club for 21 years as a player and manager and the standard never dropped below that. That's the level Ipswich Town should be endeavouring to be at again. That's where they should expect to be. It's that type of club.When I took over in 1994 the first thing I said was I wanted to take the club back into Europe and we did that.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Watson|first1=Stuart|title=Ipswich Town's standards should remain high, insists George Burley|url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/ipswich-town-s-standards-should-remain-high-insists-george-burley-1-5038022|access-date=31 May 2017|work=East Anglian Daily Times|date=29 May 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

Burley again showed interest in the Ipswich job following Mick McCarthy's exit in 2018, but he again lost out in favour of [[Paul Hurst]].<ref>{{cite web|title=George Burley wants to be the next Ipswich manager|url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/george-burley-wants-to-be-new-ipswich-town-boss-1-5504852|work=east Anglain Daily Times|access-date=20 October 2018|date=4 May 2018}}</ref>

In November 2002, Burley was on the verge of taking over as [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] manager, but he had a late change of heart and declined the offer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Peter |title=The inside story behind what Stoke City did after George Burley's disappearing act |url=https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/inside-story-behind-what-stoke-714831 |website=StokeonTrentLive |access-date=30 December 2019 |date=1 November 2017}}</ref>

===Derby County===
In 2003, Burley became interim manager of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] while permanent manager [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]] was suspended. Burley managed to halt Derby's alarming slide towards the relegation zone of the First Division (just one season after relegation from the Premier League) and kept the club up comfortably. Burley was then appointed manager permanently when Gregory was sacked. The following season ([[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]]) was often a struggle, with Derby actually finishing two places lower than the season before, but there were signs of improvement. This showed through in the [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]] season when, despite spending no money on new players, Burley transformed Derby from relegation contenders to a fourth-place finish and play-off semi-finalists. However, things were not as happy as they seemed on the surface with Burley's relationship with [[director of football]] [[Murdo Mackay]] and the club's board (who sold star player [[Tom Huddlestone]] without informing Burley) being very strained. After days of speculation and [[mudslinging]], Burley announced his resignation from Derby in June 2005.

===Heart of Midlothian===
Burley was appointed manager of [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] on 30 June 2005. A stunning start to his tenure as Hearts manager saw them top the [[Scottish Premier League]] after the first ten games, winning eight of these, including a 4–0 victory over rivals [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] – proving themselves to be genuine title challengers. However, he left the club the day after major shareholder [[Vladimir Romanov]], with whom Burley had a notoriously uneasy relationship, announced a bid to take private control of Hearts. A club statement declared his departure was by mutual consent because of irreconcilable differences.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/4367202.stm |title=Burley in shock exit from Hearts |access-date=21 January 2007|date=22 October 2005 |work=BBC Sport  }}</ref>

===Southampton===
Burley was appointed as Head Coach of [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 23 December 2005 following the departure of [[Harry Redknapp]].<ref name="Saints name Burley as head coach">{{cite news| title = Saints name Burley as head coach| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4550000/newsid_4556200/4556200.stm| publisher=CBBC Newsround| date = 23 December 2005| access-date =12 August 2007}}</ref> The club's technical director, [[Sir Clive Woodward]], was moved sideways to a newly created post as director of football as part of restructuring following Burley's appointment, before eventually leaving the club in August 2006.<ref>{{Cite web |date=31 August 2006 |title=Southampton confirm Woodward exit |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/southampton/5302170.stm |access-date=13 September 2024 |website=BBC Sport}}</ref> Following the change in control of the club in July 2006, Burley's title was changed to that of "manager". He guided Southampton to the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] play-offs but lost on penalties in the second-leg of the semi-final after drawing 4–4 on aggregate against his former club Derby County, who went on to win the final.<ref>{{Cite web |date=15 May 2007 |title=Derby secure play-off final berth |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/6649689.stm |access-date=13 September 2024 |website=BBC Sport}}</ref>

===Scotland===
It was announced on 24 January 2008 that Burley had been appointed [[Scotland men's national football team|Scotland]] manager on a four-year contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7203463.stm|work=BBC Sport |title=Burley appointed Scotland manager|access-date=24 January 2008 | date=24 January 2008}}</ref> He became the third former Ipswich manager to manage his country, as [[Alf Ramsey]] and [[Bobby Robson]] had before him. In his first match in charge, Scotland drew 1–1 with [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. In the following two friendlies, Scotland failed to register a victory, with a 3–1 loss against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], and a goalless draw with [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]].

Although winning 2–1 against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] in their second game of the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign, Burley received heavy criticism for the 1–0 defeat to [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]] in the opening match and a 0–0 home draw against [[Norway national football team|Norway]]. Questions were raised about his choice of bringing on uncapped [[Chris Iwelumo]] (who missed an open goal from 3 yards) instead of proven-goal scorer [[Kris Boyd]]. The Rangers striker quickly announced his retirement from international football while Burley was still in charge.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/3185990/George-Burleys-gamble-fails-to-pay-off-as-Scotland-stutter-in-World-Cup-qualifier-Football.html|title=Iwelumo-Boyd situation|publisher=Telegraph Sport|access-date=14 February 2010 | first=Roddy | last=Forsyth | date=12 October 2008}}</ref>

Scotland were defeated 3–0 in Amsterdam by the Netherlands, but then recovered by beating Iceland 2–1 at home. The team lost 4–0 to Norway in their next match, putting Burley's bid to take Scotland to the World Cup for the first time since 1998 in jeopardy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8193604.stm|title=Norway 4–0 Scotland |first=Clive |last=Lindsey|work=BBC Sport |date=12 August 2009|access-date=12 August 2009}}</ref> Qualification to the play-offs remained in Scotland's hands, with the team needing to win the two remaining fixtures to be guaranteed second place. [[Scottish Football Association|Scottish FA]] chief [[Gordon Smith (footballer born December 1954)|Gordon Smith]] moved to confirm that Burley's position was not under threat, but said that much depended on the final two matches.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8199263.stm|title=Burley's position is safe – Smith |work=BBC Sport |date=13 August 2009|access-date=13 August 2009}}</ref>

In the end, a 2–0 home victory over [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]] at Hampden on 5 September 2009 was followed four days later by a 0–1 defeat at home to [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]], ending Scottish hopes of qualifying for the finals.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8240464.stm|title=Scotland 0–1 Netherlands |date=9 September 2009|work=BBC Sport |access-date=16 November 2009}}</ref>

Despite failure to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, Burley was given the backing of the SFA at a meeting on 15 September 2009, to lead the country into the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign.<ref>{{cite news

His final game as Scotland manager was a 0–3 loss to [[Wales national football team|Wales]] on 14 November 2009 in [[Cardiff City Stadium|Cardiff]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8344879.stm|title=Wales 3–0 Scotland |date=14 November 2009|work=BBC Sport |access-date=16 November 2009}}</ref> On 15 November 2009, Burley came under fire, with reports suggesting he would lose his job as Scotland manager.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8361602.stm|title= Burley set to lose Scotland post|date=16 November 2009|access-date=16 November 2009|work=BBC Sport }}</ref> and the following day, Burley was sacked as manager of Scotland after winning just three out of fourteen games.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8361602.stm|title=Burley sacked as Scotland manager |date=16 November 2009|work=BBC Sport |access-date=16 November 2009}}</ref>

===Crystal Palace===
On 17 June 2010, Burley took charge of [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], with fellow Scot [[Dougie Freedman]] as his assistant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10323~2073006,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909055250/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10323~2073006%2C00.html |archive-date= 9 September 2011 |title=Burley Named Manager |publisher=Crystal Palace FC |date=17 June 2010 |access-date=12 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His first league match as Crystal Palace manager ended in a 3–2 victory over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/8881475.stm |title=Crystal Palace 3 – 2 Leicester |work=BBC Sport |date=7 August 2010 }}</ref> He was sacked after a 3–0 defeat against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] on New Year's Day, 2011.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/9332396.stm | title = Crystal Palace sack manager George Burley |work=BBC Sport | date = 1 January 2011 | access-date = 1 January 2011}}</ref>
