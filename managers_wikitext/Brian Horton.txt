'''Brian''' '''"Nobby"''' '''Horton''' (born 4 February 1949) is an English former [[Association football|footballer]] and [[Manager (association football)|manager]]. He spent 16 years as a professional player and 22 years as a manager, making 689 appearances and managing 1,098 matches. In addition to this, he spent four years as a semi-professional player and around 11 years as a [[Coach (sport)|coach]] and assistant manager.

Horton played at [[Midfielder|wing-half]], though he was forced to find employment as a builder after being released from [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]'s youth team in 1966. He joined [[Hednesford Town F.C.|Hednesford Town]] in the [[West Midlands (Regional) League]], winning the [[Staffordshire Senior Cup]] in his final appearance for the club in 1970. He turned professional by signing with [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] of the [[English Football League]] in July 1970. He established himself in the first team, making 258 appearances, before being sold on to [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] for [[Pound sterling|£]]30,000 in March 1976. Installed as club [[Captain (association football)|captain]], he helped the club to win [[Promotion and relegation|promotions]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] from the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in 1976–77 and 1978–79, being named on the [[PFA Team of the Year]] on both occasions. He also won the club's Player of the Year in 1977. Having played 251 games for the club, he was [[Transfer (association football)|transfer]]red to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in August 1981. He captained the team to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in 1981–82 and helped the club to remain in the First Division, playing 132 games in league and cup competitions.

Horton was installed as [[Player-coach|player-manager]] at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] in June 1984 and led the club to promotion out of the Third Division in 1984–85. He was sacked in April 1988 and was appointed as [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]]'s assistant manager the following month. He succeeded [[Mark Lawrenson]] as Oxford manager in October of that year. He managed to keep the club in the Second Division for five seasons despite a financial crisis caused by the death of owner [[Robert Maxwell]]. Horton was the surprise appointment as [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager in August 1993 and kept the club competitive in the Premier League before being dismissed by new club chairman [[Francis Lee (footballer)|Francis Lee]] in May 1995. He took charge at [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] the following month but was sacked with the club bottom of the Second Division in October 1997. He returned to his former club Brighton & Hove Albion as manager in February 1998, who were struggling near the foot of the Third Division and forced to play home games at [[Priestfield Stadium]] in Gillingham. He moved to another former club, Port Vale, in January 1999. Vale were [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] out of the First Division in 2000. However, Horton won his first trophy in management as they secured the [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophy]] in [[2001 Football League Trophy final|2001]]. He resigned in February 2004 following a change in ownership.

He took charge at [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] in April 2004, steering the club away from the Third Division relegation zone. He spent two full seasons in charge before being sacked in October 2006. Having spent some time out of the game, he returned to Hull City as [[Phil Brown (footballer, born 1959)|Phil Brown]]'s assistant manager in May 2007. The club were promoted to the [[Premier League]], though the two were sacked in March 2010. He spent 2011 as Phil Brown's assistant at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] and then returned to management with Macclesfield Town in March 2012, though he was unable to prevent the club from being relegated from the Football League. He joined [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] as [[Paul Dickov]]'s assistant in June 2013, before he was appointed as football coordinator at [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] by Phil Brown in August 2015. He later assisted Phil Brown at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] for two months, leaving the club in May 2018. He has been married twice and has twins.

==Playing career==
===Hednesford Town===
Born in [[Hednesford]], Staffordshire, Horton's father, Richard, was a [[Coal mining|coal miner]] at the [[North Staffordshire Coalfield]] and his mother, Irene, worked as a cook at [[Cannock Chase High School|Cannock Grammar School]].<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=11}}</ref> He started his career as a member of [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]]'s [[youth system|youth team]] at the age of 15.<ref name="nobby">{{cite web|title=No.81 Brian 'Nobby' Horton|url=http://www.hednesfordtown.com/heroes/81%20Brian%20Horton.pdf|website=hednesfordtown.com|access-date=1 April 2016}}</ref> He played regularly in the [[West Midlands (Regional) League]], though was released after two years without having appeared for the first-team, and joined hometown club [[Hednesford Town F.C.|Hednesford Town]] in the West Midlands (Regional) League after being signed by [[Player-coach|player-manager]] [[Dick Neal Jr.|Dick Neal]].<ref name="nobby"/> During his time at the club he worked in the building trade in the Walsall area.<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=16}}</ref> He became known as '''Nobby''' to fans, a nickname that stuck with him throughout his career, after a supporter stated that Horton played like [[Nobby Stiles]].<ref name="page 19">{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=19}}</ref> He won the [[Staffordshire Senior Cup]] in his final appearance for the club, a victory over [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]].<ref name="nobby"/>

===Port Vale===
Horton returned to the [[English Football League|Football League]] at the age of 21 when he signed for newly-[[Promotion and relegation|promoted]] [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] club [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in July 1970.<ref name="Kent">{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Jeff|title=Port Vale Personalities|publisher=Witan Books|page=142|year=1996|isbn=0-9529152-0-0}}</ref> It was reported that his [[Transfer (association football)|transfer]] fee was a pint of [[shandy]], as Vale were struggling financially and simply haggled with the Hednesford Town chairman by plying him with alcohol, therefore his transfer fee was 'a pint of shandy'.<ref name="Kent" /> Port Vale agreed to play a pre-season [[Exhibition game|friendly]] with Hednesford and allowed them to keep all the gate receipt money from the match.<ref name="page 19"/> Horton had been earning [[Pound sterling|£]]7-a-week at Hednesford, rising to £20 with win bonuses, supplemented by a £20-a-week income from building work, and so actually took a significant pay cut to turn professional at Port Vale on wages of £23-a-week.<ref name="page 20">{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=20}}</ref>

A first-team regular from the start under manager [[Gordon Lee (footballer)|Gordon Lee]], Horton played 40 games in the [[1970–71 Port Vale F.C. season|1970–71]] season, and scored his first competitive goal in a 3–2 win against [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] at [[Gigg Lane]].<ref name="Kent" /> He then found his scoring form in the [[1971–72 Port Vale F.C. season|1971–72]] campaign, as he hit eight goals in 47 appearances; he also became the club's [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] taker, with half of his goals coming from the spot.<ref name="Kent" /> He hit seven goals in 43 games in the [[1972–73 Port Vale F.C. season|1972–73]] season, four of his strikes coming from the penalty spot.<ref name="Kent" /> He missed a period around Christmas due to injury, and during this time his teammates struggled to find results; this ultimately cost the "Valiants", as they finished four points behind promoted [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].<ref name="Witan">{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Jeff|title=The Valiants' Years: The Story of Port Vale|publisher=Witan Books|year=1990|pages=227–257|chapter=Surviving on a Shoestring (1969–1979)|isbn=0-9508981-4-7}}</ref> The injury had come in a 2–0 defeat at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], when a knee-high [[Tackle (football move)|tackle]] left him with a hairline [[Bone fracture|fracture]] of the leg, which also caused him to miss an [[FA Cup]] third round tie with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=27}}</ref>

Lee changed the team's [[Formation (association football)|formation]] from 4–4–2 to 4–3–3 for the [[1973–74 Port Vale F.C. season|1973–74]] campaign, hoping that this would allow Horton more room in the centre of the field.<ref name="Witan"/> However, Vale's form suffered, and Lee was replaced as [[Manager (association football)|manager]] by [[Roy Sproson]] in January.<ref name="Kent" /> Vale finished the campaign one place above the [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] zone, though were seven points clear of the relegation zone. Horton played 46 games, scoring four goals.<ref name="Kent" /> Vale missed out on promotion by just four points at the end of the [[1974–75 Port Vale F.C. season|1974–75]] season, as Horton hit 13 goals in 47 games, leaving him one goal behind top-scorers [[Ray Williams (footballer, born 1946)|Ray Williams]] and [[Terry Bailey]].<ref name="Kent" /> He hit four goals in 35 games in the [[1975–76 Port Vale F.C. season|1975–76]] season, including both of Vale's goals in a win over [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] at [[Vale Park]].<ref name="Kent" /> Much to the disappointment of Vale supporters, he was sold to league rivals [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] in March 1976 for a fee of £30,000.<ref name="Kent" /> Their offer trumped the £25,000. offered by both [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] and [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]].<ref name="parallel">{{cite news |title=Nobby Horton has a place in the hearts of Brighton and Manchester City fans |url=https://inparallellines.wordpress.com/2019/04/04/nobby-horton-has-a-place-in-the-hearts-of-brighton-and-manchester-city-fans/ |access-date=31 January 2023 |work=In parallel lines |date=4 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref> In total he spent nearly six years with Port Vale, scoring a total of 37 goals in 258 games in league and cup competitions.<ref name="Kent" />

===Brighton & Hove Albion===
Manager [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]] immediately installed Horton as club [[Captain (association football)|captain]], giving him a [[Association football contracts|contract]] worth £100-a-week.<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=32}}</ref> Brighton finished fourth at the end of the [[1975–76 Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. season|1975–76]] season, three points shy of promotion, and Taylor quit the club.<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=33}}</ref> Incoming manager [[Alan Mullery]] had planned to also play in midfield for the club but after witnessing Horton in his first training session he came to the conclusion that Horton would provide the necessary leadership and skill on the [[Football pitch|pitch]], so Mullery retired as a player to concentrate fully on management.<ref name="page 54">{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=54}}</ref> For his performances at both Vale and Brighton, Horton was named on the [[PFA Team of the Year]], along with Brighton teammates [[Graham Cross]] and [[Peter Ward (footballer, born 1955)|Peter Ward]].<ref name=Lynch141>{{cite book |first=Tony |last=Lynch |title=The Official P.F.A.

The [[1980–81 Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. season|1980–81]] season was a much narrower affair.

===Luton Town===
Horton transferred to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in August 1981, as the club were competing in the Second Division under the stewardship of [[David Pleat]].<ref name="nobby"/> He was signed to replace [[Alan West (footballer)|Alan West]], who had been sold on to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=64}}</ref> Horton was installed as captain and told to play a more attacking midfield role than he had previously been used to, playing in between a midfield three with [[Lil Fuccillo]] and [[Ricky Hill]].<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=65}}</ref> He was again promoted into the top-flight, as the "Hatters" topped the Second Division table in [[1981–82 Luton Town F.C. season|1981–82]] by an eight-point margin, some 18 points clear of fourth-place [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].<ref name="nobby"/> He was named on the PFA Team of the Year for the third time in his career, alongside teammates [[Kirk Stephens]], Ricky Hill, and [[David Moss (footballer, born 1952)|David Moss]].<ref name=Lynch144>{{cite book |first=Tony |last=Lynch |title=The Official P.F.A.

Luton then went on to escape [[promotion and relegation|relegation]] on the final day of the [[1982–83 Luton Town F.C. season|1982–83]] season at [[Maine Road]], following a 1–0 over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], who took their place in the relegation zone.

===Style of play===
Horton was a fiercely competitive [[Midfielder|wing-half]] who was skilled at [[Tackle (football move)|tackling]] and [[Passing (association football)|passing]].<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=9}}</ref>

==Managerial career==

===Hull City===
Horton became player-manager of Hull City in July 1984 and led his side to promotion to the Second Division at the end of the [[1984–85 Hull City A.F.C. season|1984–85]] season.<ref name="nobby"/> He quickly built up a reputation as a "strong-minded, tactically-aware [[Coach (sport)|coach]]."<ref name=ley>{{cite news|last=Ley|first=John|title=Strong man Brian Horton adds steel to Hull's style|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/hull-city/5012756/Strong-man-Brian-Horton-adds-steel-to-Hulls-style.html|access-date=15 November 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=18 March 2009|location=London}}</ref> Due to the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] draw, three of his first four games as manager were against [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], and his very first game in charge was a 0–0 draw at [[Sincil Bank]].<ref name="page 86">{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=86}}</ref> In November, his team came from 4–1 down to beat [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] 5–4 after he instructed assistant manager [[Chris Chilton]] to "get some verbals going" at [[half-time]].<ref name="page 86"/> He signed former Luton Town teammate [[Frankie Bunn]] as a replacement for top-scorer [[Billy Whitehurst]], who he sold to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for £232,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=88}}</ref> After promotion was secured, Horton was offered a place on the board of directors.<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=90}}</ref>

The club had an excellent youth policy, which saw talent such as [[Andy Payton]] and [[Leigh Jenkinson]] develop, though [[Nick Barmby]] was such a prodigious talent that he was signed to Tottenham Hotspur at the age of 16.<ref name="page 92">{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=92}}</ref> Horton also brought in defender [[Richard Jobson (footballer)|Richard Jobson]] from [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] for £40,000 and [[Garry Parker]] from former club Luton for £72,000.<ref name="page 92"/> He attempted to sign [[Mark Bright]] from [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] for £45,000, but the chairman could not agree terms with the player.<ref name="page 93">{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=93}}</ref> The [[1985–86 Hull City A.F.C. season|1985–86]] season saw Hull come very close to earning promotion to the First Division, finishing in sixth-place, which was then the third-highest finish in the [[History of Hull City A.F.C.|club's history]].<ref name="page 93"/> At the end of the campaign Horton quit playing to concentrate on full-time management, having been [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in his final appearance.<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=94}}</ref> Despite the introduction of the [[English Football League play-offs|play-off]] system in [[1986–87 Hull City A.F.C. season|1986–87]], the "Tigers" ended the campaign in 14th-place.

The [[1987–88 Hull City A.F.C. season|1987–88]] campaign began promisingly, and Hull was in the top six, chasing the automatic promotion places by the halfway stage. However, a dreadful run of results in which there was just one win in 17 games ended any hope of promotion. Their form was not helped by the sale of star play-maker Garry Parker to Nottingham Forest for a £270,000 fee, which Horton later admitted was a mistake.<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=99}}</ref> After a 4–1 home defeat to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], chairman Don Robinson was furious and immediately fired Horton.

===Oxford United===
Horton's next move was to become assistant to former Brighton teammate Mark Lawrenson, now rookie manager at Second Division [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in May 1988.<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=108}}</ref> Lawrenson left the [[Manor Ground (Oxford)|Manor Ground]] in October 1988 after star player [[Dean Saunders]] was sold to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] without his consent, and the board elected Horton as his replacement; at the time both Derby and Oxford were owned by members of [[Robert Maxwell]]'s family.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.banburycake.net/oxfordunited/clubhistory/brieflookback/| title=Last 20 Years |work=Banbury Cake| access-date=6 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite book  | last = Brodetsky   | first = Martin   | title = Oxford United: The Complete Record   | publisher = Breedon Books   | year = 2009   | page = 83  | isbn = 978-1-85983-715-3}}</ref> The million pound fee for Saunders allowed Horton to build a squad of his own: former Brighton teammate [[Steve Foster]] (Luton Town), [[Wales national football team|Wales]] international [[Andy Melville]] (£270,000 from [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]]), [[New Zealand men's national football team|New Zealand]] international [[Ceri Evans]] ([[free agent]]), defensive midfielder [[Mickey Lewis]] (part-exchange to Derby for [[Trevor Hebberd]]), [[Jim Magilton]] (£100,000 from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]), [[John Durnin]] (£250,000 from Liverpool), and [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] international winger [[Paul Simpson (footballer)|Paul Simpson]] (£200,000 from [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=113}}</ref> He also gave débuts to [[Joey Beauchamp]] and [[Paul Kee]]. Under his leadership, Oxford finished the [[1988–89 Oxford United F.C. season|1988–89]] Second Division campaign in 17th place. In preparation for the [[1989–90 Oxford United F.C. season|1989–90]] campaign, he exploited the relationship between Derby and Oxford to sign [[Dave Penney]] for £175,000. On the pitch, it was a case of deja vu, as Oxford finished the season in 17th place, again with 54 points. Hoping to build a promotion-winning squad for the [[1990–91 Oxford United F.C. season|1990–91]] campaign, he bought [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] defender [[Les Robinson (footballer)|Les Robinson]] for £150,000. The "Yellows" finished in tenth place, eight points off the play-off places.

The club faced a financial crisis following the mysterious death of Robert Maxwell, and over the summer, Horton was forced to sell striker [[Martin Foyle]] to Port Vale for £375,000. He made no major signings in Foyle's place and instead handed débuts to [[Paul Wanless]], [[Chris Allen (footballer, born 1972)|Chris Allen]], and [[Bobby Ford]]. He also sold Paul Simpson to Derby for £650,000 in February 1992.<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=119}}</ref> The loss of close to £1 million of talent showed on the pitch, as Oxford ended the [[1991–92 Oxford United F.C. season|1991–92]] season one place and two points ahead of relegated [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]].

===Manchester City===
In August 1993, four games after the start of the [[1993–94 Manchester City F.C. season|1993–94]] [[Premier League]] campaign, Horton resigned as Oxford manager to replace [[Peter Reid]] as manager of [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] – to the surprise of many [[Manchester City F.C. supporters|supporters]] and commentators, who were expecting the appointment of someone more high-profile.<ref name="axe">{{cite web|title=Brian Horton|url=http://happyaxeman.co.uk/mcfc/?page=5.4&Mid=27|publisher=happyaxeman.co.uk|access-date=16 November 2011}}</ref> Horton initially told chairman [[Peter Swales]] that "we have the makings, the backbone of a really good squad" and that he was satisfied in not making many additions if it meant keeping hold of the existing squad; he cancelled a pre-arranged sale of [[Steve Lomas]] to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=138}}</ref> City's previous three seasons in the top-flight had yielded top-ten finishes, but Horton struggled with injuries – key striker [[Niall Quinn]] was missing through a [[cruciate ligament]] injury – and City were 20th and bottom in mid-February.<ref name="axe"/> He traded eight-year club veteran striker [[David White (English footballer)|David White]] to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in exchange for [[David Rocastle]];<ref name="axe"/> Rocastle failed to live up to expectations, and scored just two league goals. But then Horton transformed his attack by signing [[Uwe Rösler]] ([[1. FC Nürnberg|Nürnberg]]), [[Paul Walsh]] (£750,000 from [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]) and [[Peter Beagrie]] (£1.1 million from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]), and City escaped relegation after losing only two of their last 14 games of the season.<ref name="axe"/>

Horton played with two out-and-out wingers in [[1994–95 Manchester City F.C. season|1994–95]]: Peter Beagrie and £1.3million summer signing [[Nicky Summerbee]] ([[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]]).<ref name="axe"/> This led to Rösler, Walsh and Quinn scoring 47 goals between them, but also to some heavy defeats, such as the 5–0 loss to [[Manchester derby|rivals]] [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref name="axe"/> City were sixth on 3 December and there was talk of a much-awaited return to European football, as young talents such as [[Garry Flitcroft]], [[Richard Edghill]], and Steve Lomas came to the fore. However, they won only four of their remaining 25 league games, finishing just four points clear of relegation, and Horton was sacked.<ref name="axe"/> His sacking was predicted by many, as [[Francis Lee (footballer)|Francis Lee]] had taken over as chairman after Horton's appointment and wished to have his 'own man' in the dugout at [[Maine Road]].<ref name="axe"/> City went on to suffer relegation [[1995–96 Manchester City F.C. season|the following season]] under [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] and Horton said that "once I had left, Francis made transfers which I could not fathom".<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=153}}</ref>

===Huddersfield Town===
Horton made a swift return to management with [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], a club that had just won promotion to the First Division under [[Neil Warnock]], who announced his surprise resignation days after [[1995 Football League Second Division play-off final|the club's play-off success]]. Horton had been recommended to the club by [[Trevor Cherry]].<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=162}}</ref> The "Terriers" started the [[1995–96 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season|1995–96]] campaign positively and enjoyed a mid-season run of just two defeats in 19 games. They also reached the fifth round of the FA Cup, where they lost to Premier League [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in a [[Replay (sports)|replay]] at [[Plough Lane (1912–98)|Plough Lane]].<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=164}}</ref> The team were on course for a play-off place, but a run of just three wins in their final 13 games left them in eighth-place, eight points behind sixth-placed [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=166}}</ref>

Horton broke the [[List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. records and statistics|club's transfer record]] when he splashed out £1.2 million on [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] striker [[Marcus Stewart]]. However, he also sold top-scorer [[Andy Booth]] to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] for £2.7 million.<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=163}}</ref> Huddersfield finished the [[1996–97 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season|1996–97]] season just two places and eight points ahead of relegated [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]. Huddersfield had suffered injuries throughout the spine of the team as midfielder [[Lee Makel]], striker Marcus Stewart and defender [[Andy Morrison]] (£500,000 from [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]) missed much of the campaign due to injury, though £325,000 summer signing Andy Payton proved to be a revelation, hitting 19 goals in all competitions.<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=168}}</ref> Horton was sacked in October 1997 following a defeat to Nottingham Forest at the [[Kirklees Stadium]] that left Huddersfield bottom of the table.<ref name="Horton 2020 172">{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=172}}</ref>

===Brighton & Hove Albion===
In February 1998, Horton returned to one of his old clubs when he became manager of Brighton & Hove Albion. The club were second-from-bottom in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] and playing their home games {{convert|75|mi}} away at [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]'s [[Priestfield Stadium]].<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=176}}</ref> He led the club to victory over [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]], Brighton's first win in five months.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bright start for Horton|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Bright+start+for+Horton.-a060643666|access-date=15 November 2011|newspaper=The People|date=1 March 1998}}</ref> The "Seagulls" secured their Football League status in April after winning a point at league leaders [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]. They went on to finish the [[1997–98 Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. season|1997–98]] season second-from-bottom, 15 points clear of relegated [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]].<ref name="page 180">{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=180}}</ref>

Aiming for a complete overhaul of the playing squad and unimpressed by the [[reserve team|reserve]] and youth teams, Horton told chairman [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] "I want 18 out and 18 in".<ref name="page 180"/> One of the new arrivals was [[Gary Hart (footballer)|Gary Hart]], signed from [[Stansted F.C.|Stansted]] of the [[Essex Senior Football League]] for £1,000 and a set of [[Kit (association football)|kit]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Gary Hart signs new deal with Brighton and Hove Albion|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/brighton/8859768.stm|access-date=15 November 2011|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=29 July 2010}}</ref> Other signings included [[Jamie Moralee]] ([[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]]) and [[Ian Culverhouse]] ([[Kingstonian F.C.|Kingstonian]]), whilst he brought [[Martin Hinshelwood]] and [[Dean Wilkins]] onto the backroom staff.<ref name="Page 182">{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=182}}</ref> One unusual but effective piece of business was midfielder [[Paul Holsgrove]], who Horton signed on a [[Free transfer (association football)|free transfer]] from Stoke City and then sold on to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] for £113,000 in the same [[transfer window]].<ref name="Page 182"/> Brighton started the [[1998–99 Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. season|1998–99]] campaign well, though Horton left the club in January 1999 to take charge of another of his old clubs, Port Vale, after the sacking of long-serving manager [[John Rudge]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1283204.stm|title=Profile on Brian Horton|date=18 April 2001|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=2 June 2009}}</ref>

===Port Vale===
To help the Vale to avoid relegation at the end of the [[1998–99 Port Vale F.C. season|1998–99]] season, Horton brought in five players: [[Dave Brammer]] (Manchester City), [[Tony Butler (footballer)|Tony Butler]] (Blackpool), [[Carl Griffiths]] ([[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]]), [[Alex Smith (footballer, born 1976)|Alex Smith]] ([[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]]), and [[Chris Allen (footballer, born 1972)|Chris Allen]] (Nottingham Forest).<ref name="page 193">{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=193}}</ref> This spending spree set the club back £630,000, and so Horton first sold off [[Peter Beadle]] to Notts County for £250,000 to raise the cash needed for his new signings.<ref name="page 193"/> He won his first game in charge, a 2–0 win over Huddersfield Town, thanks to a brace from [[Martin Foyle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=192}}</ref> A five-game unbeaten run in April allowed the Vale to finish above relegated [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] on goals scored.<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=194}}</ref>

In a bid to survive another season in the First Division, Horton allowed ten players to leave [[Vale Park]]; the most significant departure was [[Neil Aspin]], as the 34-year-old dropped down two divisions as his career wound down. To replace these players, Horton signed three players on free transfers: [[Jeff Minton]] from former club Brighton, [[Tommy Widdrington]] from [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], and [[Steve Rimmer]] from Manchester City. As the season progressed, he released [[Marcus Bent]] and sold Carl Griffiths back to [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] for £100,000. He further sold highly rated young centre-back [[Anthony Gardner]] to Tottenham Hotspur for £1 million,<ref name="slide">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/port_vale/801960.stm|title=Vale slide into Division Two|date=28 June 2000|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=18 January 2011}}</ref> and sold Tony Butler to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] for £140,000. In their place he signed [[Micky Cummins]], [[Mark Goodlad]], [[Sagi Burton]], and [[Ville Viljanen]]; and also took [[Martin Bullock]], [[Gareth Taylor]], and [[David Healy (footballer)|David Healy]] in on [[Loan (sports)|loan]]. His side finished second-from-bottom and was relegated in [[1999–2000 Port Vale F.C. season|his first full season]] as manager.<ref name="slide"/> At the end of the campaign, Martin Foyle retired, whilst key players [[Paul Musselwhite]] and [[Ian Bogie]] also departed.<ref>{{harvnb|Horton|2020|p=195}}</ref>
