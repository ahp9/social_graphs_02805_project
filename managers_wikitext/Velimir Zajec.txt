president of [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]].

==Club career==
Zajec began his career at [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] in 1974, aged 18.<ref name="Dinamo">{{cite web|url=http://povijest.gnkdinamo.hr/popis-igra%C4%8Da/velimir-zajec.html|title=Velimir Zajec - Povijest Dinama|work=povijest.gnkdinamo.hr|publisher=[[GNK Dinamo Zagreb]]|language=hr|access-date=29 March 2018|archive-date=18 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210718154809/http://povijest.gnkdinamo.hr/popis-igra%C4%8Da/velimir-zajec.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> In ten years at the club, he helped them to two domestic cup wins, as well as the league title, their first title honour in 24 years.<ref name="Dinamo"/> In 1979 and 1984, he was named the [[Yugoslav Footballer of the Year]].{{fact|date=March 2024}}

He then transferred to Greek club [[Panathinaikos FC|Panathinaikos]], where he played over 100 games.{{fact|date=March 2024}}

==International career==
Zajec made his debut for [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in a March 1977 [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] against the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] and earned a total of 36 caps, scoring 1 goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rsssf.org/miscellaneous/joeg-recintlp.html|title=Appearances for Yugoslavia/Serbia National Team|accessdate=28 January 2023|website=RSSSF}}</ref> He captained them at both the [[1982 World Cup]] and the [[1984 UEFA European Football Championship|1984 European Championship]]. His final international was an October 1985 friendly away against [[Austria national football team|Austria]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eu-football.info/_player.php?id=23271|title=Player Database|accessdate=28 January 2023|website=EU-football}}</ref>

==Coaching career==
Following retirement, he spent two years (1989–1991) as Director of Football at former club Dinamo Zagreb before returning to Panathinaikos to run their academy. Before long, he was promoted to head coach of the club. After a period he again, he returned to Zagreb, this time as head coach, before moving once more back to Panathinaikos in 2002 to become Director of Football.

In late October 1998, Zajec replaced [[Zlatko Kranjčar]] as manager at [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] (then known as Croatia Zagreb), following Kranjčar's poor record in the [[UEFA Champions League]] [[1998–99 UEFA Champions League|group stage]], where the team only managed to grab a single point in three matches (drawing with [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] at home, before losing to both [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] and [[FC Porto|Porto]] on the road). The team's performance in the UEFA Champions League improved under Zajec, as they managed to stay undefeated in the remaining three group matches, beating Porto and Ajax and drawing with Olympiacos. Dinamo nevertheless did not manage to go through to the quarter-finals after finishing second in their group, behind Olympiacos (at the time, only the first-place finishers and the two best second-place finishers went through).

In 2004, he moved to English club [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] to take up a position as executive director. He took over as temporary team manager following the resignation of [[Harry Redknapp]] in November 2004 and was confirmed as the new manager on 21 December 2004 making him the first Croatian to manage in the Premier league.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/4111337.stm Zajec named as Pompey boss], BBC Sport, 21 December 2004</ref> Five months later, he reverted to his intended director's role, following the arrival of [[Alain Perrin]]. He resigned from his position at [[Fratton Park]] on 10 October 2005 for personal reasons.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/4322092.stm Zajec resigns from Portsmouth job], BBC Sport, 10 October 2005</ref>

On 25 May 2010, Zajec was appointed new coach at [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]], returning to the club as coach after 11 years.<ref>[http://www.tportal.hr/sport/TcomPrvaHNL/69690/Zajec-zelim-Ligu-prvaka-ali-ne-obecavam-nista.html Zajec: Želim Ligu prvaka, ali ne obećavam ništa], tportal.hr, 25 May 2010 {{in lang|hr}}</ref> However, Zajec was sacked on 9 August 2010, after leading Dinamo in just 8 competitive matches, winning the 2010 [[Croatian Supercup]], exiting the 2010–11 Champions League in the third qualifying round, and picking up four points in the first three matches in the [[2010–11 Prva HNL]].<ref name="otkaz">{{cite news|url=http://www.sportnet.hr/vijesti/401693/nogomet-1-hnl/dinamo-smijenio-velimira-zajeca|title=Dinamo smijenio Velimira Zajeca!|last=Attias|first=Vedran|date=9 August 2010|work=[[Sportnet.hr]]|language=hr|access-date=9 August 2010}}</ref>

On 8 February 2024, Zajec became the holder of the election list "Dinamovo proljeće" and therefore a candidate for Dinamo Zagreb's president. <ref>https://dinamovo-proljece.com/o-nama-2/ Velimir Zajec - nositelj izborne liste], dinamovo-proljece.com, 18 February 2024 {{in lang|hr}} </ref><ref>[https://www.facebook.com/dinamovoproljece/posts/pfbid0XGCtZ4mLiByusPFbUBNvnCEcatMJ4ALLyAjSatUTrkDjqJys39EX5yDryv3h78nhlVelimir Zajec - kandidat liste Dinamovo prolježe za predsjednika DInama], facebook.com/dinamovoproljece, 18 February 2024  {{in lang|hr}} </ref>
