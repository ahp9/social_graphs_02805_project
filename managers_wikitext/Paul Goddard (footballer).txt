During his career he played for  [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. He also played a single game for [[England national football team|England]] scoring one goal. During the 1994–95 season he was caretaker manager of Ipswich Town.

==Club career ==

A Queens Park Rangers youth product, Goddard made his senior debut in 1977 and spent three season as a striker for the ''R's''. He scored 23 goals in 75 First Team appearances between 1978 and 1980. 

Sold by Tommy Docherty/Jim Gregory in August 1980 Goddard became West Ham's record signing when he moved to [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] for £800,000.<ref name=Dyer>{{cite web | url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/sport/article-1060496-details/James+completes+Hammers+move/article.do | archive-url=https://archive.today/20121209071920/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/sport/article-1060496-details/James+completes+Hammers+move/article.do | url-status=dead | archive-date=9 December 2012 | title=James completes Hammers move | first=Ken | last=Dyer | work=[[Evening Standard]]|location=London | date=11 July 2001 | access-date=2009-03-27 }}</ref> He was West Ham's top scorer in the [[1982–83 in English football|1982–83]] season, and scored 71 goals in 213 League and Cup matches for the club. One of these goals was in the replay of the [[1981 Football League Cup final]] 2–1 defeat to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Villa Park]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Stewart ends extra-time thriller | website=West Ham United F.C. | date=14 March 1981 | url=https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2007/october/18-october/stewart-ends-extra-time-thriller | access-date=3 September 2025}}</ref> 

At the start of the [[1985–86 West Ham United F.C. season|1985–86 season]] he partnered [[Tony Cottee]] in the West Ham front line, but injury ruled him out after one game. This led to Cottee being partnered by [[Frank McAvennie]], and the McAvennie-Cottee partnership yielded 54 goals in one season, taking West Ham to 3rd place in the league.

He then moved to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in October 1986.<ref name=Dyer /> He almost single-handedly helped the club avoid relegation, scoring in seven consecutive games from 25 March to 18 April 1987.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Morton |first=David |date=2016-10-12 |title=1980s striker who saved Newcastle United from the drop |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/history/striker-who-saved-newcastle-united-12008376 |access-date=2023-05-31 |website=ChronicleLive |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Paul GODDARD - League appearances. - Newcastle United |url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/ |access-date=2025-09-02 |website=Sporting Heroes}}</ref>

He then moved on to Derby County in 1988 before signing for [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] for a club record transfer fee in December 1989.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.millwallfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10367~96505,00.html | title=Record bid turned down | access-date=29 May 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908080823/http://www.millwallfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10367~96505,00.html | archive-date=8 September 2012 }}</ref>

In 1991, he moved to Ipswich Town on a free transfer and enjoyed a few more years in the Premier League before retiring in 1994. During the 1994/95 season, he was temporarily caretaker-manager with old teammate [[John Wark]] between the departure of [[John Lyall]] and the arrival of [[George Burley]] and went on to become the club's youth team coach.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/ipswich-town-fc/paul-goddard-9543/career-at-ipswich-town-football-club_a11479/|title=Paul GODDARD – Career at Ipswich Town Football Club. – Ipswich Town FC}}</ref>

Later he worked as assistant manager at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] for [[Glenn Roeder]], a former teammate when he played at QPR and Newcastle United. He left that post on 20 January 2004, shortly after the arrival of new manager [[Alan Pardew]].

===International career===
During his playing career, he gained [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for [[England national under-21 football team|England U21s]] (scoring five times).
Goddard was capped once for [[England national football team|England]] at senior level, on 2 June 1982, a 1–1 friendly draw against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]], during which he scored England's only goal. The game was originally an [[England national football B team|England B]] fixture but was subsequently upgraded to full international status meaning Goddard was awarded his cap.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2020/sep/03/england-first-played-iceland-bobby-robson-acting-manager |title=When England first played Iceland, with Bobby Robson acting manager|work=The Guardian |date=3 September 2020 |access-date=5 September 2020}}</ref> Despite this successful appearance, he was not selected for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] squad that summer and never played a senior match for England again.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sporting-heroes.net/common/not-found.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/football/england/paul-goddard-9543/biography-1982_a11478/default.aspx|title=Paul Goddard|website=sporting-heroes.net}}</ref>
