'''Roberto Mancini''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Grande Ufficiale OMRI]]}} ({{IPA|it|roˈbɛrto manˈtʃiːni|lang}}; born 27 November 1964) is an Italian [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Football player|player]]. He is currently the head coach of [[Qatar Stars League]] club [[Al Sadd SC|Al-Sadd]].

As a player, Mancini operated as a [[deep-lying forward]], and was best known for his time at [[UC Sampdoria|Sampdoria]], where he played more than 550 matches, and helped the team win their first [[Serie A]] league title, four [[Coppa Italia]] titles, and the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]. He was capped 36 times for [[Italy national football team|Italy]], taking part at [[UEFA Euro 1988]] and the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], achieving semi-final finishes in both tournaments, although he was never put onto the pitch during the 1990 tournament. In 1997, after 15 years at Sampdoria, Mancini left the club to join [[SS Lazio|Lazio]], where he won a further ''[[List of Italian football champions|scudetto]]'' and Cup Winners' Cup, in addition to the [[UEFA Super Cup]] and two more Coppa Italia titles. Alongside [[Gianluigi Buffon]], he is the player with the most Coppa Italia titles (6).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/170909/buffon-wins-coppa-chiesa-senior-and-junior |title=Buffon wins Coppa with Chiesa Senior and Junior |publisher=www.football-italia.net |date=19 May 2021 |access-date=19 May 2021 }}</ref> As a player, Mancini would often give team talks at [[half-time]]. Towards the end of his playing career he became an assistant to [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] at Lazio.<ref>{{cite web |title=FA Cup special: The Roberto Mancini story |last=Whalley |first=Mike |work=Manchester Evening News |quote=He was the club captain, he often gave the team talks and he even helped to design the kit. |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_city/s/1420688_fa-cup-special-the-roberto-mancini-story |date=13 May 2011 |access-date=13 May 2011}}</ref>

His first manager role was at [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] in 2001, at only 36 years old, winning a Coppa Italia title. The following season, he took over as manager at Lazio, where he guided the club to another Coppa Italia title. In 2004, Mancini was offered the manager's job at [[Inter Milan]], with which he won three consecutive Serie A titles, a club record; he was dismissed in 2008. After being out of football for over a year, Mancini was appointed [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager in December 2009. He helped City win the [[2011 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]] in the [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11 season]], the club's first major trophy in 35 years, and their first league title in 44 years in the [[2011–12 in English football|2011–12 season]]. Mancini took over managerial duties at Turkish club [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in September 2013, winning the [[Turkish Cup]] in his only season at the club, before returning to Inter Milan for two more years before managing Russian side [[FC Zenit|Zenit]]. In 2018, he took charge of the [[Italy national football team]] after the team had failed to qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. In 2021, Mancini guided Italy to their second-ever [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] at [[UEFA Euro 2020|Euro 2020]]. Under his management, the team was unbeaten from October 2018 to October 2021, and holds the world record for most consecutive matches without defeat (37), but Italy then failed to reach the World Cup for the second time in a row after a play-off loss to [[North Macedonia national football team|North Macedonia]].

Mancini has reached at least a semi-final of a major national cup competition in every season he has been a manager, from 2002 to 2014. He holds a number of records, including most consecutive [[Coppa Italia#Finals|Coppa Italia finals]] from 2004 to 2008, with [[2003–04 Coppa Italia|Lazio once in 2004]] and with Inter Milan in the following four seasons.

==Early life==
Mancini was born in [[Jesi]], [[Marche]], [[Italy]], on 27 November 1964,<ref name="FACTBOX-Roberto Mancini factbox">{{cite news|title=FACTBOX-Roberto Mancini factbox|url=https://www.espn.com/espn/wire?section=soccer&id=3417413|access-date=28 October 2013|agency=Reuter|publisher=ESPN|date=29 May 2008}}</ref> but then moved onto the mountain town of [[Roccadaspide]] in [[Campania]] and was raised by Aldo and Marianna Mancini along with his younger sister Stephanie. He had served as an [[altar boy]] in his youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/mancinis-father-flies-in-to-witness-the-city-revolution-28657478.html|title=Mancini's father flies in to witness the City revolution|publisher=belfasttelegraph.co.uk|date=14 September 2011}}</ref> In 2012, Mancini made a religious pilgrimage to the site of [[Our Lady of Medugorje]] and had stated that he is a believer who prays regularly, "The world would be a better place if everyone practiced the art of praying."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/roberto-mancini-reveals-he-prayed-for-manchester-855263|title=The power of prayer: Mancini reveals he prayed for City's title win after pilgrimage to religious site|last=McLeman|first=Neil|date=31 May 2012|website=mirror.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://mysticpost.com/the-italian-football-coach-roberto-mancini-and-our-lady-of-medjugorje/|title=The Italian football coach Roberto Mancini and Our Lady of Medjugorje|last=Attard|first=Mario|date=14 July 2021|website=Mystic Post}}</ref>

==Club career==
===Sampdoria===
Mancini debuted in [[Serie A]] for [[Bologna FC 1909|Bologna]] in 1981.<ref name="FACTBOX-Roberto Mancini factbox"/> The following year, he was bought by [[UC Sampdoria|Sampdoria]], for £2.2 million, whom he played for until 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/champions-league/mancini-to-return-with-great-style-2941100.html|title=Mancini to return with great style - Independent.ie}}</ref> With Sampdoria, he formed a dynamic [[Forward (association football)#Striker|strike]] partnership with [[Gianluca Vialli]] under manager [[Vujadin Boškov]], which earned the pair the nickname ''The Goal Twins'' ("I Gemelli del Gol", in Italian).<ref name="scudetto di Vialli e Mancini">{{cite web|url=http://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/serie-a/sampdoria/2016/05/19-11655137/sampdoria_25_anni_dallo_scudetto_di_vialli_e_mancini/|title=Sampdoria: 25 anni dallo scudetto di Vialli e Mancini|publisher=Il Corriere dello Sport|language=it|date=19 May 2016|access-date=18 June 2017}}</ref> Together, they helped the club to its only [[List of Italian football champions|league title]] in [[1990–91 Serie A|1991]], four [[Coppa Italia]]s and a [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1989–90|1990]].<ref name="scudetto di Vialli e Mancini"/> He also appeared in the [[1992 European Cup Final|final]] of the [[1991–92 European Cup]] against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].<ref name="scudetto di Vialli e Mancini"/> At 27, Mancini sat on the interview panel that selected [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] as manager. Mancini often delivered the team-talk for Sampdoria. He attended board meetings and had a say in transfer business. In [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]]'s 1995 autobiography, ''Achieving the Goal'', he described the day he met Sampdoria in Genoa while playing for [[AS Bari|Bari]] and, lining up in the tunnel, became aware that Mancini was looking his way. Platt wrote: "I thought nothing of it until he asked me, very matter-of-factly, if I was staying at Bari. Outright he asked if I wanted to join Sampdoria. Mancini had been at the club years and was almost a son to the president, Paolo Mantovani". Mancini kept in touch when Platt moved to [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] and eventually helped bring him to Sampdoria. At that stage, Mancini had established himself as the most powerful voice in the ''Blucerchiati'' dressing room.

As a teenager at Sampdoria, Mancini was not someone who liked his authority being questioned. After [[Trevor Francis]] signed from [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1982, aggrieved that his place was under threat, the 18-year-old Mancini ended up picking a fight with 28-year-old Francis on the training ground. A similar incident occurred with [[Liam Brady]], who was eight years older. Additionally, [[Juan Sebastián Verón]] tells the story of swearing in Mancini's direction during an argument about a badly-taken corner. After the match, Mancini had stripped off to the waist and was waiting to fight him. "He is not an easy person, you know," Verón says. "He has this complicated personality".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jan/06/roberto-mancini-sir-alex-ferguson?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Daniel | last=Taylor | title=Roberto Mancini is Manchester City's very own Sir Alex Ferguson | date=6 January 2012}}</ref>

===Lazio===
With [[SS Lazio|Lazio]], Mancini won his second ''[[List of Italian football champions|scudetto]]'' and [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup titles]], as well as two more [[Coppa Italia]]s. In the [[1999–2000 Serie A|1999–00 season]], Lazio won the ''scudetto'' and [[1999–2000 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], but Mancini failed to score in 20 matches and later announced his playing retirement. He joined Lazio's coaching staff as Sven-Göran Eriksson's number two. In 2011, when asked about Mancini, Eriksson said: "I took him to Lazio with me and he wanted to be a manager even while he was a player. He was the coach, he was the kit man, he was the bus driver, everything. At Sampdoria he wanted to check that everything was in place before training. Sometimes I would have to tell him: 'Mancio, you have a game to play on Sunday, you will be exhausted if you have to control everything.' But he was like that."<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/sven-goran-eriksson-i-liked-city-theyll-win-the-league-ndash-absolutely-2178992.html Sven Goran Eriksson: 'I liked city. they'll win the league – absolutely' – News & Comment – Football].

==International career==
Despite success at club level, Mancini never became a regular for [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. At the under-21 level, Mancini was part of the team which reached the semi-finals in the [[1984 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]] and finished runners-up in [[UEFA U-21 Championship 1986|1986]].<ref name=storiedicalcio.altervista.org>{{cite web|url=http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/roberto_mancini.html|title=Roberto Mancini|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=it|access-date=23 January 2015}}</ref> He made his [[Italy national under-21 football team|international senior squad]] debut at the age of 19, under [[Enzo Bearzot]], on 26 May 1984, in a 2–0 away win against [[Canada national men's soccer team|Canada]] in [[Toronto]];<ref name="FACTBOX-Roberto Mancini factbox"/> he later won 36 caps, and scored four goals for his country.<ref name=figc.it>{{cite web|url=http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato|title=Mancini, Roberto|publisher=FIGC|language=it|access-date=12 November 2015}}</ref> Mancini was a starting player at [[UEFA Euro 1988|Euro 1988]], where Italy reached the semi-finals;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datasport.it/calcio/2011-2012/nazionali/italia/europei-italia-1988-urss-germania-ovest.htm|title=Europei 1988: il cammino dell'Italia|publisher=Datasport|language=it|date=4 June 2012|access-date=12 November 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012957/http://www.datasport.it/calcio/2011-2012/nazionali/italia/europei-italia-1988-urss-germania-ovest.htm|archive-date=24 December 2014}}</ref> during the tournament, he scored a goal in a 1–1 draw against hosts [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], in the opening match of the tournament on 10 June.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://it.uefa.com/uefaeuro/match/5--west-germany-vs-italy/|title=Brehme regala un punto prezioso alla Germania|trans-title=Brehme gives a precious point to Germany|publisher=[[UEFA]]|language=it|date=3 January 2012|access-date=12 November 2015}}</ref> Mancini was also a non-playing member of [[Azeglio Vicini]]'s Italian squad that finished in third place at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] on home soil.

Then, in July 2004, Lazio released Mancini from his contract<ref name="FACTBOX-Roberto Mancini factbox"/> and he joined Inter.<ref name="Roberto Mancini: Factfile"/>

===Inter===
[[File:Roberto Mancini.jpg|thumb|right|Mancini pictured in 2004 as Inter Milan manager]]

Mancini took over on 7 July 2004.<ref name="Roberto Mancini: Factfile"/> Under Mancini, Inter Milan soon won the club's first domestic trophy since 1989. Inter Milan became the dominant team in Italy. In Mancini's first season, Inter Milan won the [[2004–05 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] with a 3–0 victory over [[AS Roma|Roma]] at the [[San Siro]]. Inter Milan finished third in [[2004–05 Serie A]] and reached the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]] only to be knocked out by city rivals [[AC Milan]] 3–0 on aggregate.

In August 2005, Inter Milan won the [[2005 Supercoppa Italiana]] for the second time in their history with a 1–0 victory over [[Juventus FC|Juventus]]. In 2006, Inter Milan again won the [[2005–06 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] and [[2006 Supercoppa Italiana|Italian Super Cup]]. Following the ''[[Calciopoli]]'' scandal, [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] was stripped of the ''[[scudetto]]'' title, which was handed to Inter Milan. Inter Milan achieved a record-breaking run of 17 consecutive victories in [[2006–07 Serie A|Serie A]], starting on 25 September 2006, with a 4–1 home win over [[AS Livorno Calcio|Livorno]] and ending on 28 February 2007 after a 1–1 draw at home to [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]]. The run lasted for almost five months and is among the best in [[UEFA|European league football history]]. Inter Milan won a [[2006–07 Serie A|second successive league title]] with five games to spare and only losing one league game all season. Inter Milan finished with a record-breaking 97 points.

Mancini became the third coach in the [[history of Inter Milan]] to win back-to-back league titles after [[Alfredo Foni]] ([[1952–53 Serie A|1952–53]] and [[1953–54 Serie A|1953–54]]) and [[Helenio Herrera]] ([[1964–65 Serie A|1964–65]] and [[1965–66 Serie A|1965–66]]). Inter Milan also progressed to the [[2006–07 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] and [[2007 Supercoppa Italiana|Italian Super Cup]] for the third consecutive season but was beaten in both finals by [[AS Roma|Roma]]. Inter Milan struggled in the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], where they were knocked out in the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League#First knockout round|first knockout round]] by [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. At the end of the game, there was a mass brawl involving both sets of players.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/6426453.stm |title=Champions League brawl photos |publisher=BBC News |date=7 March 2007 |access-date=27 April 2010}}</ref> Mancini was not involved in the incident, but camera footage showed him attempting to block a camera's view before he was seen shrugging his shoulders and walking away. His reputation continued to grow as he added a third consecutive [[2007–08 Serie A|Serie A title]] to his honours. Mancini guided Inter Milan to another [[2007–08 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia final]] but lost for a second consecutive season to Roma, 2–1, at the [[Stadio Olimpico]].

Despite his successes, the inability to make any real progress in the Champions League displeased Inter Milan owner [[Massimo Moratti]]. Inter Milan was knocked out in the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League#First knockout round|first knockout round]] of the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].<ref name="FACTBOX-Roberto Mancini factbox"/> The first leg took place at [[Anfield]], with defender [[Marco Materazzi]] being sent off in the 30th minute.

====2009–10====
On 19 December 2009, Mancini was publicly revealed to be taking over as manager of [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on a three-and-a-half-year deal following the sacking of [[Mark Hughes]].<ref name="Roberto Mancini: Factfile"/> With wealthy Emirati owners who were willing to invest heavily in the team, Manchester City had become a club expectant of success.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/mancini-linked-to-city-after-dinnertable-negotiations-1297827.html|title= Mancini linked to City after dinner-table negotiations|last=Burt|first=Jason|date=10 January 2009|work=The Independent|access-date=1 January 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Having been appointed halfway through the season, Mancini's arrival had an immediate impact on City's form, with four consecutive wins.

The [[2010–11 Premier League]] season was marked by runs of mixed form. With a 2–0 win away at [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] on 19 September 2010, City moved into fourth position in the league and did not drop out of the top four positions during the rest of the season.

A fine run of form in the weeks running up to Christmas, however, meant City occupied first place in the Premier League twice over the Christmas period. In the ten games before 15 January 2011, City won seven times, drew twice and lost only once as they moved into title contention, while also securing passage into the [[2010–11 UEFA Europa League#Round of 32|Round of 32 of the]] [[2010–11 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] by finishing as the top team in [[2010–11 UEFA Europa League#Group A|Group A]]. As a result of his team's strong league form, Mancini was awarded the [[Premier League Manager of the Month]] award for December.<ref name="FA Premier League">{{cite web|url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~2261295,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106135232/http://www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0%2C%2C12306~2261295%2C00.html |archive-date= 6 November 2011 |title=Mancini and Nasri receive Barclays awards |publisher=(FA Premier League) |date=7 January 2011 |access-date=28 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

City's Premier League form tailed off again in the new year, with City jointly contesting the [[2010–11 FA Cup|FA Cup]] and Europa League, and Mancini cited burnout for losing ground in the league title race.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini: We were so tired |last=Brennan |first=Stuart |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_city/s/1411392_manchester_city_boss_roberto_mancini_we_were_so_tired |work=MEN Media |date=21 March 2011 |access-date=23 May 2011}}</ref> City was eventually eliminated from the Europa League by Ukrainian side [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] in March, but his team replied strongly by winning eight out of the next ten matches, including an [[2010–11 FA Cup#Semi-finals|FA Cup semi-final]] victory at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] over local rivals Manchester United in April.

A win over Tottenham in May guaranteed City the opportunity to play [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|Champions League football]] the following season. This win was followed by City winning the [[2010–11 FA Cup|FA Cup]] with a 1–0 victory over [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in the following weekend's [[2011 FA Cup Final|final]] at Wembley. This [[FA Cup]] triumph meant that Mancini joined five other [[List of Manchester City F.C. managers|City managers]] who had won major honours, and it ended the club's longest trophy drought in [[History of Manchester City F.C.|its history]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/sport/football/facup/news/video-mancini-on-facup-final-24596/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419074300/http://www.itv.com/sport/football/facup/news/video-mancini-on-facup-final-24596/ |archive-date=19 April 2011 |title=Roberto Mancini on Manchester City's FA Cup win over Manchester United |publisher= ITV |access-date=28 October 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://mcfc.co.uk/News/Match-reports/2011/May/FA-Cup-Final-City-v-Stoke-match-report Match report on Manchester City v Stoke City in the FA Cup final 14 May 2011 – Manchester City FC].

Due to their late run of form, City finished third in the league ahead of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] after a 2–0 win over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on the last day of the season, thereby avoiding the need to participate in [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League#Play-off round|play-off]] round fixtures in order to progress to the group stages of the following season's [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|Champions League competition]]. Only goal difference separated City from achieving a second-place finish over [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

====2011–12: Premier League Champion====
The club was quieter in the closed season transfer window than in previous years, with the club's spending of approximately £75 million more in line with the corresponding amounts spent by rivals Manchester United and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. £60 million of this sum was used to purchase two players: [[Sergio Agüero]], for a club record fee, and [[Samir Nasri]] from [[Atlético Madrid]] and Arsenal respectively. Other players purchased during the summer included [[Gaël Clichy]] and [[Stefan Savić]], while [[Owen Hargreaves]] joined on a free transfer after having been released by Manchester United. City began the [[2011–12 Premier League|Premier League season]] very strongly, winning 12 of their first 14 matches and scoring an impressive 48 goals while only conceding 13. These results left City undefeated and five points clear at the top of the league over second-placed Manchester United by the beginning of December.

A revitalised [[Edin Džeko]] won the [[Premier League Player of the Month]] award for August 2011, and David Silva won the same award for September 2011. Many were impressed with the impact of Agüero and Nasri, which had given City an exciting, attacking verve.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Why Aguero's 30-minute cameo may have been the spark that changes Manchester City for ever |last=Holt |first=Oliver |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/blogs/mirror-football-blog/Oliver-Holt-opinion-Why-Sergio-Aguero-30-minute-cameo-may-have-been-the-spark-that-changes-Manchester-City-for-ever-article786053.html |newspaper=Daily Mirror |date=15 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Aguero's priceless gifts may be the making of City |last=Lawton |first=James |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/james-lawton-agueros-priceless-gifts-may-be-the-making-of-city-2338587.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=17 August 2011 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Can Sergio Agüero's artillery propel Manchester City to the title? |last=Taylor |first=Daniel |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/aug/16/sergio-aguero-manchester-city-debut |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 August 2011 |location=London}}</ref> Mancini was also responsible for inflicting United's worst loss since 1955 when his City side won 6–1 away at [[Old Trafford]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/15325536 | work=BBC News | title=Man Utd 1–6 Man City | date=23 October 2011}}</ref> He was named Premier League Manager of the Month as a result of City's strong form in the month of October.

City failed to progress, but finished third in the group with ten points, normally enough to guarantee qualification into the knock-out stages.[[File:Mancini Nasri Aguero.JPG|thumb|Mancini (left), [[Samir Nasri]] and [[Sergio Agüero]] with the [[Premier League|Premier League trophy]] during Manchester City's victory parade, May 2012]]

A 3–2 loss to Manchester United in the FA Cup [[2011–12 FA Cup|third round]] on 8 January 2012 was bittersweet. City had [[Vincent Kompany]] controversially sent-off in the sixth minute and United managed to create a 3–0 lead before half-time against a lacklustre and beleaguered City team. However, after numerous tactical changes from Mancini at half-time, City came out fighting with ten men, a renewed version of the team that had played in the first half.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Roberto Mancini showed Sir Alex Ferguson how to play with 10 men |last=Cox |first=Michael |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jan/09/roberto-mancini-alex-ferguson-tactics |newspaper=The Guardian |date=9 January 2012 |access-date=31 May 2012 |location=London}}</ref> Two goals from Aleksandar Kolarov and Sergio Agüero narrowed the deficit to just one goal. City was in the ascendency and continued to push for an equalising goal despite having only ten men, but failed to do so with the final whistle. Mancini later believed the match was a seminal moment in the development of his team, demonstrating that City was a better team than United. He believed that the match helped to carve out a fighting spirit that his team had previously lacked.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Roberto Mancini says league title is everything for Manchester City |last=Jackson |first=Jamie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/04/roberto-mancini-manchester-city |date=4 May 2012 |access-date=31 May 2012 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}</ref>

City also progressed to the [[2011–12 Football League Cup#Semi-finals|League Cup semi-final]], maintaining Mancini's record of reaching a major competition semi-final in every season he has managed. City played Liverpool and conceded an away goal in the first leg with a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] from [[Steven Gerrard]]. City went to Anfield and led twice with goals from [[Nigel de Jong]] and Edin Džeko, but another penalty from [[Steven Gerrard]] and a goal from [[Craig Bellamy]] meant Liverpool won 3–2 on aggregate.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Liverpool 2–2 Manchester City |last=McNulty |first=Phil |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16606933 |work=BBC Sport |date=25 January 2012 |access-date=31 May 2012}}</ref> On 13 May 2012, City clinched the Premier League title in [[Manchester City F.C. 3–2 Queens Park Rangers F.C.|a 3-2 comeback win]] over [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] after originally being 2–1 down going into injury time.

Manchester City won 3–2 on this occasion. On 21 November 2012, a 1–1 draw at home to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] saw Manchester City and Mancini exit the Champions League at the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group D|group stage]] for the second successive season.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20321630|title=Man City 1–1 Real Madrid|work=BBC Sport |date=21 November 2012}}</ref>

At the end of the calendar year of 2012, Manchester City was second in the Premier League, seven points behind local rivals Manchester United. In contrast to the 2011–12 league season, Mancini's team struggled to score sufficient goals and suffered some poor results in the second half of the season, such as a 3–1 loss to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 9 February 2013 (which Mancini described as the worst performance during his time in charge at City) and a 2–0 loss to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 16 March. City's poor form led to United capturing the Premier League title on 22 April with a 3–0 win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] with four games to spare. On 11 May, Manchester City lost to Wigan Athletic 1–0 in the [[2013 FA Cup Final]], with a late goal from Wigan's [[Ben Watson (footballer, born July 1985)|Ben Watson]].

There was much controversy surrounding [[Italy national football team|Italy]]'s [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] match on 28 March 2015 against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]], as Italy head coach [[Antonio Conte]] called up Brazilian-born [[Éder (Italian footballer)|Éder]] and Argentine-born [[Franco Vázquez]]. Both players hold an Italian citizenship, as their lineage is Italian, allowing them to be eligible to play for Italy. Speaking at a Serie A meeting on 23 March 2015, Mancini said: "The Italian national team should be Italian. An Italian player deserves to play for the national team while someone who wasn't born in Italy, even if they have relatives, I don't think they deserve to".

Mancini succeeded [[caretaker manager|caretaker]] [[Luigi Di Biagio]] on 14 May 2018 as manager of the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]]. He signed an incentive-based contract, which would run until 2020, extended automatically to 2022 if Italy was to [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying Group J|qualify]] for [[UEFA Euro 2020|Euro 2020]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.football-italia.net/121398/mancini-day-what-we-learned|title=Mancini day - what we learned|publisher=Football Italia|date=15 May 2018}}</ref><ref name="Nazionale2018">[https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/43687934 Roberto Mancini: Italy appoint former Manchester City manager]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.football-italia.net/121375/official-italy-appoint-mancini|title=Official: Italy appoint Mancini|publisher=Football Italia|date=14 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.football-italia.net/116764/official-di-biagio-italy-friendlies|title=OFFICIAL: Di Biagio for Italy friendlies|publisher=Football Italia|date=5 February 2018}}</ref> Italy had failed to qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] under [[Gian Piero Ventura]] after a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA second round#Matches|play-off]] defeat six months earlier, the first time they missed the World Cup since the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] and a major tournament since [[UEFA Euro 1992]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.football-italia.net/112772/ignominious-italy-out-world-cup|title=Ignominious Italy out of World Cup|publisher=Football Italia|date=13 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/14/this-is-the-apocalypse-italian-press-mourns-football-world-cup-exit |title='This is the apocalypse': Italian press mourns nation's World Cup exit|date=14 November 2017|work=Guardian|access-date=14 November 2017}}</ref>

Mancini shaped the national team differently. Three of his assistants, [[Alberico Evani]], [[Attilio Lombardo]] and [[Fausto Salsano]], played successfully with him at Sampdoria in the 1990s, as well as [[Gianluca Vialli]]. Vialli joined as head of delegation in October 2019 after fighting pancreatic cancer. Mancini's team did not include only players from the big teams based in Milan, Rome or Turin. Out of the 26 players, nobody grew up the big metropolises. Half of them came from villages with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants: 10 from the north of Italy, 7 from the middle, and 9 from the south.<ref>[https://www.fr.de/sport/das-genua-gen-90848899.html Das Genua-Gen], Frank Hellmann, Frankfurter Rundschau, 8 July 2021.</ref>

===Saudi Arabia national team===
Mancini was appointed as head coach of the [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia national team]] on 27 August 2023 on a contract running to 2027,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/66634777 |title=Roberto Mancini named new Saudi Arabia coach |website=BBC Sport |date=27 August 2023 |access-date=28 August 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Garrick |first=Omar |title=Roberto Mancini appointed Saudi Arabia manager |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4810581/2023/08/27/roberto-mancini-saudi-arabia-manager/ |access-date=2024-02-11 |website=The Athletic |date=27 August 2023 |language=en}}</ref> and managed the Green Falcons through the [[2023 AFC Asian Cup knockout stage]], where they lost to [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] 4–2 on penalties in the round of 16.

Mancini was highly criticized{{By whom|date=July 2025}} for his behavior during the Saudi Arabia match against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] in the [[2023 AFC Asian Cup knockout stage|2023 AFC Asian Cup Round of 16]]. As the match went to a penalty shootout, Mancini was seen walking down the tunnel after [[Abdulrahman Ghareeb]] missed the second penalty for Saudi Arabia. Mancini turned and headed to the changing room without watching [[Hwang Hee-Chan]] convert the decisive kick that saw Saudi Arabia lose 2–4 on penalties. He would later apologize in the post-match conference :"I apologise [for leaving early], I thought it was finished. I didn't want to disrespect anyone,". "I want to say thank you to all my players for what they did. They are improving a lot."<ref>{{cite news |date=30 January 2024 |title=Saudi coach Mancini sorry for leaving shootout loss early |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/39424702/saudi-coach-mancini-sorry-leaving-shootout-loss-early |access-date=31 January 2024 |website=ESPN}}</ref>

On 24 October 2024, Mancini reached a joint agreement with the [[Saudi Arabian Football Federation]] to end his contract as national team manager, following disappointing results during the [[2026 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC third round|2026 FIFA World Cup qualification]] after draws against low-ranked sides [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]] and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy5l4xxy1neo|title=Mancini leaves role as Saudi Arabia manager|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 October 2024}}</ref>

==Management style==
Despite having been a support striker during his playing career, Mancini places great emphasis on building from the back, stressing the importance of not conceding a goal means the team will always have an opportunity to win, going as far to say: "I like 1–0 wins. When you don't concede a goal and you have players like [[Edin Džeko]], [[Carlos Tevez]] or [[David Silva]], you win 90%. I prefer we are boring for two to three matches and we win 1–0.

[[File:Roberto_Mancini_RED_BULL_STADIUM_JERSEY_NY.jpg|thumb|left|Mancini in 2010]]
At Manchester City, Mancini had inherited a team from [[Mark Hughes]], which while showing great prolificity and potential in front of goal, had an insecure defence. Intensively coaching his defence enabled him to get his tenure at City off to a positive start. In Inter's [[2007–08 Serie A|2007–08]] Serie A-winning season, Inter Milan conceded the fewest goals in the league with 26, 11 fewer than [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] and [[AS Roma|Roma]], and at City, his team gradually garnered a reputation as being well organised defensively and tough to break down. In Mancini's first full season in charge at City, they conceded 33 goals in the Premier League, the fewest along with Chelsea and 18 clean sheets, the highest in the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 Premier League season]].

Mancini's training methods have been criticised by some City players,<ref>{{cite news |title=Carlos Tevez criticizes Roberto Mancini's training methods |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/13/carlos-tevez-criticises-roberto-mancini |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=13 April 2010 |access-date=26 September 2010 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref> especially by ex-Manchester City fitness coach [[Raymond Verheijen]], who is a personal fitness coach for [[Craig Bellamy]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ex-coach attacks Roberto Mancini's 'crazy' training at Manchester City |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/sep/23/roberto-mancini-training-methods-manchester-city |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=23 September 2010 |access-date=26 September 2010 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref> During his time at City, Mancini tried to stamp his authority with rebellious players who were not performing well and stated: "If a top player is not happy then it's better to go."<ref>{{cite news |title=Roberto Mancini tells Carlos Tevez to shape up or ship out of City |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/29/roberto-mancini-carlos-tevez-city-manchester |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=29 April 2010 |access-date=26 September 2010 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref>

Mancini is known to use the media to alleviate the pressure from his players. Following City's defeat to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[2011–12 Premier League|2011–12 season]], a deficit of eight points had been established between rivals [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] with only six matches left to play.
