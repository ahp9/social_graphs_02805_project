'''Walter Mazzarri''' ({{IPA|it|ˈvalter madˈdzarri}}; born 1 October 1961) is an Italian professional [[Association football|football]] manager and former player.

After a 14-year playing career with Italian clubs including [[AC Reggiana 1919|Reggiana]] and [[Empoli FC|Empoli]], Mazzarri coached several smaller Italian sides and in 2007 took up a managerial position with [[UC Sampdoria|Sampdoria]]. With the help of the attacking partnership of [[Antonio Cassano]] and [[Giampaolo Pazzini]], he led the team to qualify for the [[UEFA Cup]] in his first season and subsequently reached the [[Coppa Italia]] final the next year. In 2009, he joined [[SSC Napoli|Napoli]], where he implemented a [[Formation (association football)#3.E2.80.934.E2.80.933|3–4–3 formation]] with which he later became associated. With the attacking trio of [[Ezequiel Lavezzi]], [[Edinson Cavani]] and [[Marek Hamšík]], nicknamed ''I tre tenori'' ("The three tenors"), he helped the team qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time in the club's history in 2011, and won the [[Coppa Italia]] the following season, the club's first trophy in over 20 years. In his final season with the team, he managed a second-place finish in [[Serie A]], the club's best league finish in over 20 years. In 2013, he moved to [[Inter Milan|Inter]] but was sacked halfway through his second season with the club. He later managed [[Torino FC|Torino]] in Serie A, and had one year in charge of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in England's [[Premier League]] in [[2016–17 Premier League|2016–17]]. In 2023, after a gap year from his last management for [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]], he returned to [[SSC Napoli|Napoli]] but was sacked in February 2024 after three months.

==Playing career==
Mazzarri, a midfielder and a product of [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]]'s youth system, made his professional debut in 1981 for [[Pescara Calcio|Pescara]] of [[Serie B]], and played a short Serie A stint in [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] the following season, before being sold to [[A.C. Reggiana 1919|Reggiana]]. He had his longest period at [[Empoli F.C.|Empoli]], who won promotion to Serie A for the first time during his time with the Tuscan side. After several spells with mostly minor teams, including a two-year stint with [[S.S.D. Acireale Calcio 1946|Acireale]] where he was part of the team that won a historic first promotion to Serie B, and then playing in the Italian second tier in 1993–94, Mazzarri ended his playing career in 1995 with [[Sassari Torres 1903|Sassari Torres]].

==Managerial career==
===Early years===
Mazzarri started his coaching career as [[Renzo Ulivieri]]'s assistant at [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in 1998. His first spell in charge came in 2001–02 for [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[Lega Pro Seconda Divisione|Serie C2]] team [[ASD Città di Acireale 1946|Acireale]], where he had been a player from 1992 to 1994. Subsequently, he returned to his native [[Tuscany]] to coach [[A.C. Pistoiese|Pistoiese]] of Serie C1 in 2002–03 and [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]] of [[Serie B]] in 2003–04, bringing the ''amaranto'' led by [[Cristiano Lucarelli]] back to [[Serie A]]. He was coach of [[Reggina Calcio|Reggina]] from 2004 to 2007, leading the [[Calabria]]n side to Serie A survival in three consecutive seasons, the last obtained on the final day of the season despite an 11-point deduction. In May 2007, Mazzarri was made an honorary citizen of [[Reggio Calabria]], after helping the club avoid relegation during the [[2006–07 Serie A]] season.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2007/05/29/mazzarri-samp-fatta.html |title=Mazzarri-Samp, è fatta |publisher=La Repubblica |language=it |date=29 May 2007 |access-date=15 April 2019 }}</ref>

On 14 November 2023, [[SSC Napoli|Napoli]] appointed Mazzarri as their new head coach on a seven-month contract, replacing [[Rudi Garcia]], marking Mazzarri's return to Naples after ten years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/napoli-name-mazzarri-new-coach-2023-11-14/ |publisher=Reuters |date=14 November 2023 |title=Napoli name Mazzarri as new coach |access-date=14 November 2023}}</ref> He was sacked on 19 February 2024, after a 1–1 home draw to [[Genoa CFC|Genoa]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hayes |first1=Apollo |title=Napoli sack Mazzarri and bring in Calzona, no Hamsik return |url=https://football-italia.net/napoli-sack-mazzarri-bring-calzona/ |website=football-italia.net |access-date=19 February 2024 |date=19 February 2024}}</ref>

==Style of management and reception==
Tactically, Mazzarri is known for using a fluid attacking 3–4–3 formation as a manager; at Napoli, his effective front three of Lavezzi, Hamšík, and Cavani were dubbed ''I tre tenori'' ("[[The Three Tenors]]").<ref name="Three Tenors"/><ref name="Key Battles"/> He has also used variations of this system on occasion throughout his career, such as the [[Formation (association football)#3–5–2|3–5–2]] formation, the [[Formation (association football)#3–4–1–2|3–4–1–2]], the 3–4–2–1, and the [[Formation (association football)#3–5–1–1|3–5–1–1]],<ref name="rivalità"/><ref name="comparisons"/><ref name="ethos"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Torna la difesa a tre?

The [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing-backs]] would push up to join the forwards in attack when the team were in possession, to help create or finish off chances. However, they would also subsequently track back off the ball, turning the defensive line-up into a back-five.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sellitti |first1=Nicola |title=Mazzarri e la legge del 3-5-2 Il modulo nel destino azzurro |url=https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Napoli/09-10-2009/mazzarri-legge-3-5-2-501559352364.shtml |access-date=24 May 2024 |work=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=9 October 2009 |language=it-IT}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Bianchin |first1=Luca |title=Juve-Inter, mai così distanti Tre tenori in mezzo: Conte parte da +23 Mazzarri s'aggrappa ad Alvarez e Palacio |url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2014/febbraio/02/Juve_Inter_mai_cosi_distanti_ga_0_20140202_df9bbd2a-8bd6-11e3-aa8c-161e16d20aaf.shtml |access-date=24 May 2024 |work=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=2 February 2014 |language=it}}</ref> During his second spell at Napoli, Mazzarri also used a [[Formation (association football)#4–3–3|4–3–3 formation]], which had been employed by his predecessor, Luciano Spalletti, during the 2022–23 season.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mazzarri a Napoli riparte da Spalletti: idee di 4-3-3 |url=https://www.goal.com/it/liste/mazzarri-napoli-modulo-come-gioca-osimhen-kvara-difesa-attacco/bltbcee9c23542fb5ed#cs642f1b53441ac372 |publisher=www.goal.com |access-date=24 May 2024 |language=it |date=16 November 2023}}</ref>
