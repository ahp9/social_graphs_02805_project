'''Guus Hiddink''' ({{IPA|nl|ˈɣys ˈɦɪdɪŋk|-|Nl-Guus Hiddink.ogg}}; born 8 November 1946) is a Dutch former football manager and professional player. He enjoyed a long career playing as a [[midfielder]] in his native Netherlands. After retiring as a player in 1982, Hiddink went into management, leading clubs and countries from across the globe to achieve various titles and feats. With [[PSV Eindhoven]] he won the [[UEFA Champions League|European Champion Clubs' Cup]], the predecessor of the UEFA Champions League. With [[Real Madrid]] he won the [[Intercontinental Cup (1960–2004)|Intercontinental Cup]].

==Playing career==
Hiddink was born in [[Varsseveld]]<ref name=BDFutbol/> and started his career as a player in the youth side of amateur club SC Varsseveld. He turned professional after signing for Dutch club [[De Graafschap]] in 1967, playing at the [[Doetinchem]] club under manager [[Piet de Visser (football manager)|Piet de Visser]]. In 1973, during Hiddink's second spell there, he and manager de Visser earned promotion to the [[Eredivisie]], the top league in Dutch football.<ref>{{cite news |title=Oeuvreprijs naar Piet de Visser |url=http://www.net2client.com/ZZZ/08/04101/Uitslagen_2004.htm?MCT7evlngrp3%C3%BE |url-status=dead |publisher=Rinus Michels Awards 2005 |date=28 May 2005 |access-date=17 January 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070928064135/http://www.net2client.com/ZZZ/08/04101/Uitslagen_2004.htm?MCT7evlngrp3%C3%BE |archive-date=28 September 2007 |language=nl}}</ref> For some years the careers of the two men intersected: when Hiddink managed [[PSV Eindhoven]], De Visser scouted numerous South American players for the team, such as [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], [[Romário]], and former Chelsea defender [[Alex (footballer, born June 1982)|Alex]]. Also, De Visser, in his role as personal advisor to [[Roman Abramovich]], was influential in bringing Hiddink to the [[Russia national football team|Russia national team]] and later to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] as caretaker manager following the dismissal of Brazilian [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]]. 

Hiddink spent most of his playing career at De Graafschap, including three years under de Visser, and remains a fan of the club. He joined PSV in 1970, but after failing to win a permanent position in the team, rejoined De Graafschap after just one year and remained there until 1977. In 1981, he rejoined De Graafschap again and retired a year later. Generally he played as a [[Midfielder (association football)|midfielder]].

==Managerial career==

}}
Hiddink honed his coaching skills as assistant manager at PSV Eindhoven from 1983 until he was appointed manager there in March 1987. When he took command, the club was three points behind [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in the [[1986–87 Eredivisie|league]], with ten matches remaining. PSV, however, managed to win the championship six points ahead of Ajax.

It was at PSV where he led the team to its first ever [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] triumph in 1988 (and [[The Treble]]), affirming the Eindhoven club's ranking as one of the three giants of Dutch football, alongside rivals Ajax and [[Feyenoord]]. He also won three Eredivisie titles with the club between 1987 and 1990. "Hiddink will never take all the credit for himself, he will also involve his staff in it. That adds to the strong sense of unity. Hiddink has final responsibility, but always shares it with the team around him. He is a real team player", said [[Berry van Aerle]], who was coached by Hiddink in two separate periods with PSV.<ref>{{cite news |title=Van Aerle about Hiddink: "He is a real team player" |url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=418237.html |url-status=dead |work=Berend Scholten @ UEFA.com |date=5 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102135043/http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=418237.html |archive-date=2 November 2012}}</ref>

Overall, Hiddink's PSV side won three consecutive [[Eredivisie]] titles, three consecutive [[KNVB Cup]]s and the [[1987–88 European Cup|European Cup]] in the historic [[Treble (association football)|Treble]]-winning season of [[1987–88 PSV Eindhoven season|1987–88]].

Hiddink also had a coaching stint at Turkish club [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football)|Fenerbahçe]] in 1990, but was dismissed after one year, later joining Spanish giants [[Valencia CF|Valencia]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Viner |first=Brian |author-link=Brian Viner |title=Guus Hiddink: Flying Dutchman |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/guus-hiddink-flying-dutchman-1670444.html |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=18 April 2009 |access-date=1 May 2009}}</ref>

===Netherlands national team===
Hiddink faced his biggest managerial challenge when he took over the reins of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]] on 1 January 1995,<ref name=dutchjob>{{cite news |last=Yannis |first=Alex |title=Soccer Report |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E6DF1038F933A15751C1A962958260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=20 December 1994 |access-date=20 September 2008}}</ref> where he took charge of a team of talented individuals continually racked by internal arguments and disputes. His usual [[Formation (association football)#4–4–2|4–4–2]] tactic of deploying wingers backed-up by central midfielders resulted in goals from defensive midfielders such as [[Philip Cocu]] and [[Edgar Davids]]. Hiddink took a firm approach to the team, an example of which was demonstrated at [[UEFA Euro 1996]] when Edgar Davids was sent home after an argument with Hiddink.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Davids matures, sends Dutch to quarters |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/events/1998/worldcup/news/1998/06/29/91st_minute/ |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=29 June 1998 |access-date=20 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020210111818/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/events/1998/worldcup/news/1998/06/29/91st_minute/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 February 2002}}</ref><ref name="nyt_davids_redemption">{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Roger |title=WORLD CUP '98; Netherlands' Davids Comes in From Cold |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/30/sports/world-cup-98-netherlands-davids-comes-in-from-cold.html |work=The New York Times |date=30 June 1998 |access-date=7 October 2008 |issn=0362-4331 |language=en-US}}</ref> The team reached the quarter-finals of that tournament.

He was able to prevent further internal conflict in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]<ref name="nyt_davids_redemption" /> where his team played some of the more entertaining football in that tournament.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1013331/index.htm |title=Soccer:Orange Blossom |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=13 July 1998 |access-date=7 October 2008 |archive-date=4 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304020700/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1013331/index.htm |url-status=dead}}</ref> The team beat [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the quarter-finals 2–1, then suffered a defeat at the hands of [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on penalties in the semi-final—later finishing fourth. This loss signalled an end of another era for Hiddink, as he resigned as Netherlands national coach soon after, where he was then appointed manager of Spanish giants [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]].

===Real Madrid and Real Betis===
Hiddink became manager of Spanish [[La Liga]] side [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] in the summer of 1998, replacing [[Jupp Heynckes]], but poor league form and off-pitch remarks about the board and finances of the club prompted his termination in February 1999.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/1999/02/02/deportes/2N0124.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213191016/http://www.elmundo.es/1999/02/02/deportes/2N0124.html |archive-date=13 February 2010 |title=Lorenzo Sanz: "If he said it, he'll be gone in five minutes" |work=El Mundo |date=2 February 1999 |access-date=20 September 2008 |language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Hiddink to Sanz: "This club has to be much more professional" |url=http://www.elmundo.es/1999/01/28/deportes/28N0099.html |work=El Mundo |date=28 January 1999 |access-date=20 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020817023353/http://www.elmundo.es/1999/01/28/deportes/28N0099.html |archive-date=17 August 2002 |language=es}}</ref>

Hiddink then took over the reins at Spanish club [[Real Betis]] in 2000 for the rest of the season. His time there ended badly, with him being sacked by May 2000.<ref name="rte_fired">{{cite news |title=Guus Hiddink has been sacked by Real Betis |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2000/0502/scottish1.html |publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] |date=2 May 2000 |access-date=20 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605134439/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2000/0502/scottish1.html |archive-date=5 June 2011}}</ref>

In the summer of 2000, rumours were rife over his future, with Scottish club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] among the clubs named as a potential destination.<ref name="rte_fired" /> The temptation to manage another World Cup–bound international team proved irresistible to him, however, and he agreed to coach the [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea national team]] on 1 January 2001.

===South Korea===
Hiddink became manager of South Korea in January 2001.<ref name=southkoreajob>{{cite news |title=Hiddink to lead South Korea |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2002/1060755.stm |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=8 December 2000 |access-date=8 March 2013}}</ref> Success hardly came easy with a team that had appeared in five straight World Cups but had yet to win a single match. South Korea co-hosted the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] tournament with Japan. Both countries were expected to make the second round of the tournament and it was clearly expressed that Hiddink's team was expected to perform to that standard as well.<ref name="nyt_sk_savior">{{cite news |last=Longman |first=Jere |title=South Koreans' Savior Is Found in Dutchman |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E2D7123FF932A15755C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |date=21 June 2002 |access-date=1 October 2008}}</ref>

[[File:2004 guuseum.jpg|thumb|right|''Guuseum'' in [[Varsseveld]]. 히딩크 박물관 in [[Korean language|Korean]]]]

Hiddink's first year in charge was met with heavy criticism from the South Korean media,<ref name="nyt_sk_savior" /> as he was often spotted together with his girlfriend when some felt<ref name="nyt_sk_savior" /> he should instead have been busy working on the team. After a 2–1 loss to the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] [[CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]] team in January 2002, he was criticized again for not taking his job seriously.<ref name="nyt_sk_savior" /> Nevertheless, the team he assembled was a cohesive unit. However, Hiddink began focusing on physical fitness for players during training in preparation for the World Cup later that year.

At the World Cup, Hiddink's team achieved its first victory in the tournament's history in a 2–0 group win over [[Poland national football team|Poland]]. After a 1–1 draw with the U.S. and a 1–0 victory against heavily favoured [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], South Korea advanced to the second round.

Their second-round opponents were [[Italy national football team|Italy]], whom they upset 2–1 with a golden goal by [[Ahn Jung-hwan]]. The Korean public began to dream of a semifinal berth, something that came true after another upset, this time [[Spain national football team|Spain]], on penalties in the quarterfinal. This surpassed the feat of [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]] in the tournament [[1966 FIFA World Cup|36 years earlier]], which beat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] to reach the quarterfinals.

South Korea's miracle run finally ended after [[Germany national football team|Germany]] under [[Rudi Völler]] won 1-0 in the semifinals. As with the Dutch team four years earlier in France, Hiddink led his team to fourth place after a 3–2 defeat to [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] in the consolation game.

Prior to the tournament, football pundits and fans alike never expected this level of success. Many in South Korea were overjoyed with the semi-final berth.<ref name="nyt_sk_savior" /> Hiddink became the first-ever person to be given [[Honorary Citizen of South Korea|honorary South Korean citizenship]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Honorary Citizenship |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/2002/07/03/hiddink_psv |url-status=dead |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=3 July 2002 |access-date=7 October 2008 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130119230856/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/2002/07/03/hiddink_psv |archive-date=19 January 2013}}</ref><ref name="nyt_sk_rewards" /> In addition, other rewards soon followed&nbsp;— a private villa in [[Jeju Island|Jeju-do]] island,<ref name="nyt_sk_rewards" /> free flights for life with [[Korean Air]] and [[Asiana Airlines]], and free [[Taxicab|taxi]] rides, amongst others.<ref name="nyt_sk_rewards">{{cite news |last=Longman |first=Jere |title=A Little Traveling Music: Some Coaches Get Around |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/sports/soccer/21coaches.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |date=21 June 2006 |access-date=7 October 2008}}</ref> The Gwangju World Cup Stadium in [[Gwangju]], where South Korea qualified for the semi-finals, was renamed [[Guus Hiddink Stadium]] in his honor shortly after the tournament.<ref>{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Dale |title=Russia: A new hope |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=539119&&cc=3888 |url-status=dead |publisher=ESPN |date=29 May 2008 |access-date=3 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025234738/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=539119&&cc=3888 |archive-date=25 October 2012}}</ref> His hometown of [[Varsseveld]], where a ''Guuseum'' was set up by his relatives in his honor, became a popular stop for South Koreans visiting the Netherlands.

===PSV===
Hiddink chose to return to his native country and took over the coaching duties at [[PSV Eindhoven]] in 2002.<ref name=psvreturn>{{cite magazine |title=Hiddink returns to Holland after wonderous World Cup run |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/2002/07/08/hiddink_eindhoven/ |url-status=dead |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=8 July 2002 |access-date=7 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906165233/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/2002/07/08/hiddink_eindhoven |archive-date=6 September 2008}}</ref> During his second spell with PSV, Hiddink won three [[Eredivisie|Dutch league titles]] ([[2002–03 Eredivisie|2002–03]], [[2004–05 Eredivisie|2004–05]], and [[2005–06 Eredivisie|2005–06]]), the 2005 [[KNVB Cup|Dutch Cup]] and the 2003 [[Johan Cruijff Shield|Dutch Super Cup]]. In Europe, the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League|2004–05]] [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] led to PSV's first ever appearance in the semi-final of the tournament since it adopted its current format in 1992–93 (PSV won the European Cup, the predecessor to the modern Champions League, in 1988, with Hiddink as coach). PSV narrowly lost the semi-final to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], on [[Away goals rule|away goals]].

In the [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League|2005–06 Champions League season]], PSV made it through the group stage, but was eliminated in the first knockout round, having lost five of its starting 11 ([[Park Ji-sung]] to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Lee Young-pyo]] to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Mark van Bommel]] to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Johann Vogel (footballer)|Johann Vogel]] to Milan and [[Wilfred Bouma]] to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]) to transfers.

===Australia===
On 22 July 2005, Hiddink became manager of the [[Australia men's national soccer team|Australia national team]].<ref name=australiajob>{{cite news|title=Hiddink gets Australia coach role|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4669189.stm|access-date=8 March 2013|publisher=BBC|date=22 July 2005}}</ref> He announced he would manage both PSV and Australia at the same time.<ref name=australiajob/>

In the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (play-off CONMEBOL-OFC)|play-offs]] held with [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in Montevideo on 12 November and in Sydney on 16 November 2005, both home teams won 1–0. Australia went on to win 4–2 on penalties<ref name="nyt_wc2006">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/17/sports/soccer/17soccer.html |title=On to Germany: Final Five World Cup Berths Settled |work=The New York Times |date=17 November 2005 |access-date=7 October 2008}}</ref>&nbsp;— the first time Australia had qualified for the finals in 32 years, and the first time that any team had qualified through winning a penalty shoot-out.

Hiddink was a popular figure in Australia and was referred to affectionately as "Aussie Guus". A telling example of the public affection for him was the Socceroo fans chant of "Goooooooooooos!" during moments of play. Slogans for the Socceroos' 2006 World Cup campaign were "No Guus, No Glory", "Guus for P.M." and "In Guus We Trust", as well as the play on words of the famous taunt "Guus your Daddy?". During the World Cup, a Sydney newspaper started a humorous campaign to lure him away from Russia by proposing a national "Guus tax" to pay his wages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/guus-tough-love-turned-russia-212000464--sow.html|title=Guus' tough love turned Russia around|date=25 June 2008|work=Yahoo Sports}}</ref> More seriously, his reputation was enhanced by his transformation of the national side, with pundits focusing on the improvement to Australia's defence. He is credited with turning a team which conceded many goals under [[Frank Farina]] into a solid defensive unit which only conceded one goal away from home to both Uruguay and the Netherlands. Hiddink's assistants at Australia were Dutch legend [[Johan Neeskens]] and former Australia international [[Graham Arnold]].

The Socceroos defeated [[Japan national football team|Japan]] 3–1 during their first game in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], with [[Tim Cahill]] scoring two goals (84', 89') and [[John Aloisi]] scoring one (92') all in the last eight minutes to claim their first World Cup goals and victory ever.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.espnfc.com/uk/en/report/191929/report.html |title = Australia 3 – 1 Japan |publisher = [[ESPN]] |date = 12 June 2006 |access-date =12 May 2014}}</ref> An early controversial<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.theage.com.au/news/aussie-update/referee-apologises-to-schwarzer-for-error/2006/06/13/1149964535252.html |title = Referee apologises to Schwarzer for error |work = [[The Age]] |date = 13 June 2006 |access-date =7 October 2008 |location=Melbourne |first=Matthew |last =Hall}}</ref> call by the Egyptian referee that awarded a goal to the Japanese team, despite an apparent foul to Australia goalkeeper [[Mark Schwarzer]], had the Australians playing catch up until the last eight minutes. After scoring the first goal, Cahill was lucky to get away with a potential foul when he tripped Japan's [[Yūichi Komano]], who had dribbled into the Australian penalty area. The referee missed the incident, and Cahill then broke to score the second on the counter. FIFA's spokesman for refereeing Andreas Werz said that while Japan's first goal was irregular, Egyptian referee Essam Abdel Fatah should also have given Japan a penalty.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jun/15/worldcup2006.sport12 |title = Japan were robbed by referee, admits Fifa official |work = [[The Guardian]] |date = 15 June 2006 |access-date =7 October 2008 |location=London}}</ref>

Australia followed the match against Japan with a 2–0 loss to Brazil, meaning the Socceroos needed at least a draw against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in their last group match to qualify for the knockout stages for the first time in its history. After a match fraught with controversy and erroneous decisions from referee [[Graham Poll]], including an unprecedented three yellow cards given to the same Croatian player, ironically the Australian-born [[Josip Šimunić]], the game ended 2–2, and the Socceroos had their draw thanks to a goal from [[Harry Kewell]] to level the game with minutes to spare.

In the second round, [[Italy national football team|Italy]] beat Australia 1–0. After controversially sending off Italian defender [[Marco Materazzi]] in the 55th minute, Spanish referee [[Luis Medina Cantalejo]] awarded Italy's [[Fabio Grosso]] a controversial penalty kick eight seconds from the end of normal time, which was converted by [[Francesco Totti]]. This put Australia out of the World Cup, marking the official end of Hiddink's tenure as Australia's national coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world-cup-2006/a-beautiful-mind/2005/12/16/1134703612062.html|title=A beautiful mind|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>

Russia's [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying|Euro 2008 qualification]] hopes came into question after a 2–1 loss to [[Israel national football team|Israel]]. However, after a win against [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]], and [[England national football team|England]] losing out to Croatia on the last match day, Russia and Hiddink secured qualification for the final stages of [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]].

===Chelsea===
After the sacking of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'s manager, the Brazilian [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]], during the [[2008–09 Premier League]] season, Chelsea confirmed on 11 February 2009 that Hiddink would become Scolari's replacement until the end of the season, whilst continuing his duties with Russia.<ref name=chelseafcjob>{{cite news |title = Chelsea confirm Hiddink as coach |url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/7882667.stm |publisher = BBC Sport |date = 11 February 2009 |access-date =11 February 2009}}</ref> Hiddink's first game in charge was a 1–0 away victory against [[Aston Villa]] at [[Villa Park]].<ref>{{cite news |url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7885820.stm |title = Aston Villa 0–1 Chelsea |first = Phil |last = McNulty |publisher = [[BBC News]] |date = 21 February 2009 |access-date =27 February 2009}}</ref> His first game in charge at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] was a 1–0 victory over [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] in the [[UEFA Champions League 2008–09#First knockout round|Champions League knockout stage]].<ref>{{cite news |url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7899584.stm |title = Chelsea 1–0 Juventus |publisher = BBC Sport |date = 25 February 2009 |access-date =27 February 2009 |first=Phil |last=McNulty}}</ref> Success continued in the form of a 3–1 away victory against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]—commentators stated that Hiddink had rejuvenated Chelsea following Scolari's departure.<ref>McNulty, Phil (8 April 2009) [https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7977013.stm Liverpool 1–3 Chelsea] [[BBC Sport]] Retrieved on 9 April 2009</ref><ref>Kay, Oliver (9 April 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110604205019/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article6062954.ece Liverpool left on ropes by Hiddink's mastery] ''[[The Times]]''.

Hiddink only lost once during his tenure as Chelsea manager, a 1–0 loss to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] at [[White Hart Lane]], where [[Luka Modrić]] scored the only goal of the match. As it turned out, even winning every league game in charge would not have been enough to see Hiddink secure the Premier League title. In the final home game of the season, in which Chelsea beat [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] 2–0, Chelsea home fans chanted Hiddink's name throughout the match and called for Chelsea owner [[Roman Abramovich]] to "sign him up" on a permanent basis.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/1660824 |title = After The Whistle: Songs of Praise |publisher = Chelsea F.C. |date = 18 May 2009 |access-date = 12 May 2014 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140619172649/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/1660824 |archive-date = 19 June 2014 |df = dmy-all}}</ref> Hiddink's highly positive reception highlighted the Chelsea fans' appreciation of the manager.

===Turkey===
On 16 February 2010, [[Turkish Football Federation]] President [[Mahmut Özgener]] and Hiddink held talks in [[Amsterdam]].

===Anzhi Makhachkala===
On 17 February 2012, Hiddink agreed an 18-month deal to manage Russian club [[FC Anzhi Makhachkala|Anzhi Makhachkala]], his first permanent club post in six years.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/17073674|title=Guus Hiddink named Anzhi Makhachkala manager|date=17 February 2012|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=24 January 2014}}</ref> In his [[2012–13 FC Anzhi Makhachkala season|second season]], he led the team to the bronze medal in the [[2012–13 Russian Premier League|Russian Premier League]], and Anzhi made it to the round of 16 of the [[UEFA Europa League]] for the first time. In the quarter-finals of the same competition, having gone down to ten men 55 minutes into the second leg against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], Anzhi came close to going through when [[Mbark Boussoufa]]'s free kick hit the post before [[Papiss Cissé]] headed home the winner in the last seconds of the tie, meaning the Magpies won 1–0 on aggregate. This was the second time that the English side have knocked out a team managed by Hiddink in the competition, having beaten his PSV side 3–2 on aggregate in the quarter-finals of the [[2003–04 UEFA Cup|2003–04]] season. He announced his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season on 28 November 2012, but later changed his mind.

On 11 June 2013, Hiddink decided to extend his contract by one more year at Anzhi. Just two games into the [[2013–14 Russian Premier League]] season after a 2–1 defeat at [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]], however, he unexpectedly resigned on 22 July 2013.

===Return to Netherlands national team===
On 28 March 2014, it was announced that Hiddink would return to manage the Dutch national team after [[Louis van Gaal]] would step down following the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]].

===Return to Chelsea===
On 19 December 2015, Hiddink was appointed first-team manager of English side [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] until the end of the [[2015–16 Chelsea F.C. season|2015–16]] season, following the dismissal of [[José Mourinho]]; he joined the club in the same capacity he did back in 2009.

===China U21===
On 10 September 2018, Hiddink took over the [[China national under-23 football team|China under-21 national team]] but was fired in September 2019 after a string of disappointing results, culminating with a 2–0 defeat against [[Vietnam]] under-22 men's team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/sport/football/article/3029623/dutchman-guus-hiddink-steps-down-after-12-months-charge-china-under|title = Guus Hiddink steps down as China U21 coach after 12 months|website=Scmp.com|date = 20 September 2019}}</ref> The coach of the Vietnamese team coincidentally was [[Park Hang-seo]], assistant coach of South Korea's national team in the 2002 World Cup under Hiddink.

Hiddink came out of retirement to assist his former Socceroos assistant [[Graham Arnold]] in Australia's two-match friendly series against New Zealand, for regular assistant coach [[René Meulensteen]] was scouting the Socceroos' Qatar 2022 opponents in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |date=2022-09-21 |title=Guus Hiddink on Socceroos bench for friendly vs New Zealand |url=https://apnews.com/article/soccer-sports-new-zealand-australia-middle-east-7a24f1d55faaa26b1e5fa9d3ca5e6e3f |access-date=2022-09-26 |publisher=AP News}}</ref>

The temporary arrangement formed part of the Socceroos' centenary celebrations. Hiddink was on the Australian bench for their 1–0 win in [[Lang Park|Brisbane]] on 22 September 2022, and in [[Eden Park|Auckland]] three days later.

==Tax evasion==
In February 2007, Hiddink was given a six-month suspended jail sentence and fined €45,000 after being found guilty of tax evasion by a Dutch court. Prosecutors had demanded a ten-month prison sentence for Hiddink, who was accused of evading €1.4&nbsp;million in Dutch taxes by claiming to be a resident of Belgium from 2002 to 2003. The Dutch Tax Intelligence and Detection Service claimed that he had not spent enough nights at his Belgian house which he had stated was his primary address. Hiddink denied this accusation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hiddink Escapes Jail for Tax Fraud |url=http://www.kommersant.com/p745984/r_500/Hiddink_Verdict_Jail_Tax/ |work=[[Kommersant]] |publisher=Kommersant Publishing House |date=28 February 2007 |access-date=23 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502133007/http://www.kommersant.com/p745984/r_500/Hiddink_Verdict_Jail_Tax |archive-date=2 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/27/newsstory.sport14 |title=Hiddink found guilty of tax fraud |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 February 2007 |access-date=20 September 2008 |location=London |first=Paolo |last=Bandini}}</ref>
