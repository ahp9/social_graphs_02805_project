'''John Angus Lyall''' (24 February 1940 – 18 April 2006) was an English [[association football|footballer]] and manager primarily known for his 34 years at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. He played for the club as a youth, then as a first-team player before injury cut short his career. He then joined the coaching staff, before becoming the manager of the senior team in 1974. He stayed in that role until 1989. He subsequently went on to manage [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] from 1990 to 1994.

==Early life ==
Lyall was of Scottish descent. His mother, Catherine, was from the [[Isle of Lewis]], and his father, James, was from [[Kirriemuir]].<ref name="JLMD14">{{ cite book| title= Just Like My Dreams | page = 14 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.scotsfootballworldwide.scot/coodnae The Coodnaes], Scots Football Worldwide</ref> He was born in [[Ilford]], Essex.

==Club career==
Watched by the club's manager, [[Ted Fenton]], and chief scout [[Wally St Pier]], Lyall was offered a place at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] aged fifteen.<ref name="JLMD22">{{ cite book| title= Just Like My Dreams | page = 22 }}</ref> In October 1955 he was taken on as a groundstaff boy, with duties such as [[football boot|boot]] cleaning, painting the football stands and wages clerk.<ref name="JLMD23">{{ cite book| title= Just Like My Dreams | page = 23 }}</ref> He played youth team football as a [[left back]].<ref name="obit">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4922314.stm |title=Former West Ham boss Lyall dies |publisher=BBC News |date=19 April 2006 |access-date=29 April 2010}}</ref> In February 1957 he won his only significant international honour when he played for [[England national under-18 football team|England Youth]] in a 7–1 victory over Luxembourg at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]].<ref name="JLMD31">{{ cite book| title= Just Like My Dreams | page = 31 }}</ref> In 1957 he was also a member of the West Ham side which lost 8–2, on aggregate, to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1950s#1956/57: Manchester United v.

He was offered the role of part-time youth team manager.<ref name="NRTS13">{{ cite book| title= Nearly Reached The Sky | page = 13 }}</ref>

==Managerial career==
===West Ham United===
Impressing at part-time youth manager Lyall was offered the role on a full-time basis in 1967.<ref name="NRTS13"/> He rose through the coaching ranks at Upton Park to succeed [[Ron Greenwood]] as team manager in September 1974,<ref name="NRTS13"/> managing West Ham for 15 years (1974–1989). In 1975, at the end of his first season as manager, West Ham won the [[1975 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] and reached the final of the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] the following year, losing 4–2 to [[Anderlecht (football club)|Anderlecht]]. However, West Ham slipped down to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1978. Lyall attempted to rebuild the side and made significant purchases in [[Phil Parkes (footballer born 1950)|Phil Parkes]], £565,000 from [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], a world record for a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]<ref name="NRTS14">{{ cite book| title= Nearly Reached The Sky | page = 14 }}</ref> and [[Ray Stewart (Scottish footballer)|Ray Stewart]] from [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] for £430,000, a British record for a teenager.<ref name="NRTS14"/> West Ham returned to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1981 winning the title by a thirteen-point margin.<ref name="NRTS15">{{ cite book| title= Nearly Reached The Sky | page = 15 }}</ref>

During their exile from the top flight, on 10 May 1980, West Ham beat [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[1980 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]], the last team outside the top flight to do so. In their 1981 promotion season, Lyall also led the Hammers to the final of the League Cup – where they drew 1–1 against [[Liverpool]], before losing the replay 2–1, having led early in the match. They also reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup in the same year, losing to eventual winners [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]].

West Ham spent the first four years back in the top flight consolidating their position. Long serving [[Trevor Brooking]] and [[Frank Lampard Sr.|Frank Lampard]] both retired and [[Billy Bonds]] was struggling with the effects of first team football.<ref name="NRTS15"/> Lyall again attempted to rebuild the team, bringing [[Frank McAvennie]] from [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] and [[Mark Ward (footballer born 1962)|Mark Ward]] from [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]]. 28 goals from McAvennie, 25 from [[Tony Cottee]] and an eighteen-game unbeaten run saw Lyall take West Ham to their highest ever league finish in the 1985–86 First Division campaign when they finished third behind champions [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and runners-up [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. However, they were unable to compete in the [[UEFA Cup]] because of the ban on English teams from European competition arising from the previous year's [[Heysel Stadium Disaster|Heysel Disaster]].<ref name="NRTS15"/>
Lyall was unable to build on the side which finished third in the First Division. McAvennie was sold to [[Glasgow Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in 1987 and Cottee to Everton in July 1988 for a British transfer record of £2.05 million.<ref name="NRTS17">{{ cite book| title= Nearly Reached The Sky | page = 17 }}</ref> Their replacements combined with the additions of [[Tommy McQueen]], [[Gary Strodder]], [[David Kelly (association footballer)|David Kelly]], [[Allen McKnight]], [[Liam Brady]], [[Julian Dicks]] and the return of McAvennie in March 1989 failed to save West Ham from relegation in May 1989.<ref name="NRTS17"/> Lyall was sacked in June 1989.<ref>{{cite news|author=Julie Welch |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/apr/20/guardianobituaries.mainsection1 |title=Obituary John Lyall |work=The Guardian |date= 20 April 2006|access-date=29 April 2010 | location=London}}</ref> He was awarded an ex gratia payment of £100,000 but left the club in what Lyall described as 'upsetting' circumstances, meriting only 73 words in a terse acknowledgement of his service in the club programme, Lyall left West Ham after 34 years service.<ref name="NRTS18">{{ cite book| title= Nearly Reached The Sky | page = 18 }}</ref>

===Ipswich Town===
He made his return to football management on 11 May 1990 with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. During the 1989–90 season, he acted as technical advisor to [[Terry Venables]].

After Ipswich finished 14th in his first season, he brought [[John Wark]] back to [[Portman Road]] for a third spell.

At the end of 1991–1992, Lyall guided Ipswich Town to the Second Division championship and promotion to the newly formed Premiership. In January 1993, Ipswich were fourth in the Premiership but a dip in form during the final weeks of the season saw Ipswich finish 16th. The following season, 1993–94, brought a similar pattern; a good start followed by a slump – Ipswich finished 19th in the final table and were only saved from relegation by [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]'s late 3–2 defeat at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Lyall resigned as Ipswich Town manager in December 1994, with the club bottom of the Premiership.

==Death==
Lyall died suddenly on 18 April 2006, after suffering a heart attack, at his home in [[Tattingstone]],<ref>{{cite web|author=<!--lead container name-->John Lyall dies suddenly |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/suffolk/content/articles/2006/04/19/john_lyall_feature.shtml |title=John Lyall dies suddenly |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 July 2008 |access-date=29 April 2010}}</ref> [[Suffolk]], at the age of 66.<ref name="obit"/> He was survived by his wife of more than 40 years, Yvonne, and his son Murray. After leaving football management in December 1994, he had bought a farm in [[Suffolk]] and was still living there at the time of his death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/apr/20/guardianobituaries.mainsection1|title=Obituary: John Lyall|newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 April 2006|last1=Welch |first1=Julie }}</ref>

When West Ham played [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the [[FA Cup Semi-final]] on 23 April 2006 at [[Villa Park]], a one-minute silence was held in Lyall's honour, although after only a few seconds the West Ham fans started a chant of "Johnny Lyall's Claret and Blue Army" in tribute to their most successful ever manager. West Ham won the match 1–0 to reach their first [[FA Cup Final]] since 1980 when Lyall was in charge.<ref>{{YouTube|ZNAFcqR7uu0}}</ref>
On 5 December 2007, it was announced that the Heritage Foundation charity would be erecting a [[blue plaque]] in Lyall's memory at West Ham's [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park ground]] on 20 January 2008.<ref>[http://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/content/west_ham_united/story.aspx?brand=RECOnline&category=Hammers&tBrand=RecOnline&tCategory=hammersnew&itemid=WeED05%20Dec%202007%2015%3A48%3A46%3A447 Newham Recorder&nbsp;– Blue plaque tribute for legendary Lyall<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theheritagefoundation.info/westham.html |website=The Heritage Foundation |title=John Lyall Plaque Unveiling |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017221442/http://www.theheritagefoundation.info/westham.html |archive-date=17 October 2010 |url-status=usurped}}</ref>

In December 2009, West Ham renamed the main gates to Upton Park as ''The John Lyall Gates''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bdrecorder.co.uk/content/hammers/story.aspx?brand=RECOnline&category=Hammers&tBrand=RecOnline&tCategory=hammersnew&itemid=WeED23%20Dec%202009%2016%3A02%3A21%3A640 |title=Legend Lyall's very own pearly gates |publisher=Bdrecorder.co.uk |date=23 December 2009 |access-date=29 April 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> West Ham announced in May 2015 that as part of their relocation to the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]] in 2016, the gates would be moved to the new site.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/News/Articles/2015/May/15-May/John-Lyall-Gates-will-make-Stratford-move | title=John Lyall Gates will make Stratford move | publisher=whufc.com | date=15 May 2015 | access-date=22 June 2015}}</ref> They are currently on display in the club's official store.

In October 2025, some of Lyall’s medals and awards were sold by auctioneers, [[Barnebys]]. These included his winner’s medal from the 1975 FA Cup final which fetched £6606.43, the winner’s medal from the 1980 FA Cup final which fetched £6007.77, his [[England national under-18 football team|England youth]] cap from 1957 which fetched £400 and his 1991/92 Ipswich Town manager of the season trophy, his contracts at West Ham and his football tie collection.<ref>{{cite web | last=Cunningham | first=Alice | title=Football manager John Lyall's personal items sold at auction | website=BBC News | date=30 October 2025 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crrejznww4wo | access-date=30 October 2025}}</ref>
