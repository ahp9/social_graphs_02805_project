'''James Gabriel''' (10 October 1940 – 10 July 2021) was a Scottish [[association football|football]] [[defensive midfielder]] and [[defender (association football)|defender]] who earned two [[cap (sports)|caps]] with the [[Scotland national football team]]. Chiefly associated with English clubs [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Southampton F.C|Southampton]], Gabriel played extensively in Scotland and England before ending his career with the [[Seattle Sounders (NASL)|Seattle Sounders]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968-1984)|North American Soccer League]]. He then became a coach in both England and the United States.

==Playing career==

===Dundee===
Jimmy Gabriel first came to the attention of [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] when he played at right-half for the Scotland under-15 schoolboys in an international at [[Dens Park]]. His talent shone through and Dundee manager [[Willie Thornton]] snapped him up after the game, despite interest from several other top clubs.

He was initially loaned out to Dundee North End Juniors, but was recalled to Dens Park a year later. He made his debut for Dundee as a 17-year-old on 13 August 1958 in a 2–1 [[Scottish League Cup]] victory over [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]].

He was to remain a first team regular at Dundee, going on to make 67 appearances. In March 1960, [[Bob Shankly]] had taken over as manager at Dundee and, although he wanted to keep Gabriel, was unable to refuse the offer of £27,000 from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]'s manager, [[Johnny Carey]]. This made Jimmy the most expensive player to leave Scotland.

===Everton===
Gabriel joined Everton after three years at [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] in March 1960. Although it took him some time to settle into the pace of the English game, there was a steely determination about the young Scot that was to stand him in good stead. Gabriel became a strong influence in the Everton side as a powerful right-half whose preference for a defensive role made him a useful partner in the midfield for the more attacking [[Brian Harris (footballer)|Brian Harris]] on the left.

He played 304 games for Everton, scoring 37 goals and won two Scottish caps. At Everton he won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title in 1962-63 and the [[FA Cup]] in 1966.<ref>[http://soundercentral.com/museum/1974updates/jimmy_gabriel.htm Jimmy Gabriel is "All the Best" of Sounders | goalWA.net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

By 1967, he was being challenged for his place in the side by [[Alan Ball (footballer)|Alan Ball]] and the emerging [[Howard Kendall]]. [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]'s manager [[Ted Bates (footballer)|Ted Bates]] tried to sign him initially in March 1967 but Gabriel was reluctant to move South. Eventually, when it was clear that Kendall was to be first-choice, Gabriel agreed to sign for the Saints in July, joining them for a fee of £42,500.

===Southampton===
At Southampton, Gabriel was a vital part of the defence alongside [[John McGrath (footballer born 1938)|John McGrath]] and [[Denis Hollywood]] and helped Saints avoid relegation several times. He was a tough defender but had skill to match. He was occasionally drafted in as an emergency striker with some degree of success.

He played a total of 224 matches for the Saints, scoring 27 goals, and was a firm crowd favourite.

===AFC Bournemouth, Swindon and Brentford===
He left [[The Dell (Southampton F.C.)|The Dell]] at the end of the 1971–72 season to join [[AFC Bournemouth]].

He also spent a short period on loan at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] before finishing his UK playing career at [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]].

===Seattle Sounders===
In 1974 Gabriel moved to the United States where he joined the [[Seattle Sounders (NASL)|Seattle Sounders]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968-1984)|NASL]] as a player/assistant coach. That season he anchored the Sounders defence and earned second team NASL [[All-star game|All Star]] recognition. In 1976 the Sounders moved to the newly built [[Kingdome]] where he scored the first goal in the stadium's history. The goal, a fabulous header off a cross from [[Tommy Jenkins]], his former Southampton teammate, came against [[Pelé]] and the [[New York Cosmos (1971–1985)|New York Cosmos]]. In 1977, Gabriel replaced [[John Best (soccer)|John Best]] as head coach of the Sounders. Even as a coach, he continued to suit up to play, seeing time in two games in 1977 and one in 1979.

===International===
Gabriel earned two [[cap (sports)|caps]] with [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and six more with the [[Scotland national under-23 football team|Scotland under-23 team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/scotlandu23/player.php?playerid=58|title=Scotland U23 Player Jimmy Gabriel Details|work=fitbastats.com|access-date=24 October 2015}}</ref>

==Managerial career==

===Seattle Sounders and San Jose Earthquakes===
Prior to becoming head coach of the Sounders, Gabriel had acted as an assistant coach and head of the Sounders' reserve team program. When he became head coach he had several Sounder legends including [[Mike England]], [[Geoff Hurst]] and [[Bobby Moore]] on his team. Under his guidance, Seattle made it to the championship game only to fall to the hated [[New York Cosmos (1971–1985)|New York Cosmos]]. He was unable to replicate his first year success and in 1980, the Sounders replaced him with [[Alan Hinton]].

In 1980 he was contracted to coach ASL expansion team the [[Phoenix Fire (soccer)|Phoenix Fire]], but the team folded in pre-season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://funwhileitlasted.net/2011/05/03/1980-phoenix-fire-soccer/|title=1980 Phoenix Fire • Fun While It Lasted|date=3 May 2011}}</ref>

Gabriel then went on to coach [[George Best]] and the [[San Jose Earthquakes (1974–88)|San Jose Earthquakes]] (NASL) from 1980 to 1982 for one outdoor season and two [[indoor soccer|indoor]] seasons. During the 1981–82 indoor season he appeared in a handful of indoor matches for San Jose.

===AFC Bournemouth and Everton===
On returning to Britain in 1986, he spent four years as coach of Bournemouth, before going back to Goodison Park in 1990, where he became assistant to [[Colin Harvey]] at Everton.

He was briefly caretaker manager of Everton for one game in November 1990 and for seven games between December 1993 and January 1994. According to [[Yahoo! Sports]] Gabriel's points per game average of 0.14 from his seven games makes him statistically the least successful manager of the Premier League era with one point from a possible 21 gained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/the-rundown/least-successful-premier-league-managers-113441372.html|title=The least successful Premier League managers|date=23 April 2012|work=Yahoo Sport|access-date=24 October 2015}}</ref>

He continued coaching Everton's reserves until 1997.

===Back to Seattle===
Gabriel returned to [[Seattle]] in 1997<ref name=gohuskies.com>{{citation|title=Player profile – Jimmy Gabriel|url=http://www.gohuskies.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=208222711|publisher=UW Huskies Sports|access-date=24 February 2011}}</ref> where he became an assistant to [[Dean Wurzberger]], who played for Gabriel on the Sounders reserve teams in the 1970s, on the [[Washington Huskies]] men's and women's teams. Both teams won the 2000 [[Pac-10]] championships. In addition to other players, Jimmy coached [[Hope Solo]]. Gabriel was also the coaching director of the Lake Washington Youth Soccer Association and worked in certifying coaches for the State Association. Jimmy provided radio commentary for the Seattle Sounders. He and his wife, Pat, resided in [[Kirkland, Washington]].<ref name=gohuskies.com/>

Gabriel also served several years as an assistant coach with the Sounders. On 2 October 2005, the Sounders defeated the [[Richmond Kickers]] to take the US [[USL First Division|Second Division]] championship. On this high note, Gabriel retired from the Sounders.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2002534641_sounders02.html | work=The Seattle Times | first=Matt | last=Massey | title=Sounders win championship in extra lengthy finale | date=2 October 2005}}</ref>

On 29 March 2009, Gabriel was honoured by the new [[Seattle Sounders FC]] MLS club with the "Golden Scarf" award for his services to soccer in Seattle. He received the scarf at a ceremony on the pitch before the Sounders' second game, versus [[Real Salt Lake]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Gabriel suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]] in the later years of his life.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Prentice|first1=David|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/jimmy-gabriel-obituary-everton-legend-21022381|title=Jimmy Gabriel obituary - Everton legend who was a warrior and a gentleman|publisher=Liverpool Echo|date=11 July 2021|accessdate=11 July 2021}}</ref> He died on 10 July 2021 in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], aged 80.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Jayda|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/sounders/jimmy-gabriel-known-as-the-original-mr-sounder-dies-at-age-80/|title=Jimmy Gabriel, known as the original Mr. Sounder, dies at age 80|publisher=Seattle Times|date=10 July 2021|accessdate=11 July 2021}}</ref>
