==Playing career==
{{expand section|date=September 2013}}
Born in [[Hastings]], Ball began his career in central defence but eventually moved into central midfield. He played 389 games for Sunderland in all competitions, scoring 27 goals. His career took off with a spell at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and, after leaving Sunderland, he had spells at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. Whilst at Sunderland, he played in the [[1992 FA Cup Final]] where they lost 2–0 to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lfchistory.net/SeasonArchive/Game/1854 | title=Liverpool 2 - 0 Sunderland | publisher=www.lfchistory.net | access-date=25 September 2013}}</ref>

Ball, a former club [[captain (association football)|captain]], was named Sunderland Player of the Year for the [[1990–91 in English football|1990–91]] season, and again in [[1996–97 in English football|1996–97]], the year they were relegated from the [[Premier League]]. He was part of the Sunderland sides that won [[Football League First Division|First Division]] titles in 1996 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web | title = Kevin Ball | publisher=Sunderland A.F.C. | access-date = 20 November 2017 | url = https://www.safc.com/history/the-roker-roar/kevin-ball}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
Between 6 March and 8 May 2006 Ball acted as Sunderland [[caretaker manager]] for the last ten games of the [[Sunderland A.F.C. season 2005–06|2005–06 season]] following the sacking of [[Mick McCarthy]], taking five points from these games.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/does-sacking-a-manager-late-in-the-season-work-8531590.html?action=gallery&ino=4 | title=Does sacking a manager late in the season work? | work=The Independent | access-date=25 September 2013 | location=London | first=Sam | last=Newhouse | date=26 March 2013}}</ref> Although Ball expressed his interest in the manager's job on a full-time basis, incoming chairman [[Niall Quinn]] was keen for the club to appoint a 'world-class manager' following the club's takeover by the [[Drumaville Consortium]], ruling Ball out of the running. Ball remained at Sunderland under the new regime, returning to his former post of assistant [[Academy of Light|academy]] manager.

Manager [[Martin O'Neill]] promoted Ball to become the club's senior professional development coach in July 2012, which included being responsible for the club's reserve team and the club's under-21 players. In 2013, he again became caretaker manager following the sacking of Paolo Di Canio.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11695/8937848/kevin-ball-steps-into-breach-as-sunderland-wait-to-name-new-boss | title=Kevin Ball steps into breach as Sunderland wait to name new boss | publisher=Sky Sports | date=23 September 2013 | access-date=25 September 2013}}</ref> Ball's first game in charge resulted in a 2–0 home win over Peterborough in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]].

==Club ambassador==

As well as coaching at Sunderland after his retirement as a player, Ball has served as club ambassador.
