'''David Wagner''' (born 19 October 1971) is a professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Football player|player]] who was most recently the manager of [[EFL Championship]] club [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].

Wagner grew up in West Germany. He made his professional debut with [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] in 1990 and played as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for several clubs in the first and second division of [[German football league system|German football]]. Son of an American stepfather<ref name="ruhr24" /> and German mother, Wagner played for the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]], earning eight [[Cap (sport)|caps]] from 1996 until 1998.

From 2011 to 2015 Wagner managed [[Borussia Dortmund II]]. In November 2015 took the manager's position at [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], whom he led to the [[Premier League]] via the [[2017 EFL Championship play-off final]]. He left Huddersfield in January 2019, and then had brief spells at [[Bundesliga]] club [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] and [[Swiss Super League]] club [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]].

==Early life and club career==
Wagner was born in [[Frankfurt]], West Germany.<ref name="ruhr24" /> His biological father is from [[Thailand]],<ref name="11 Freunde">{{Cite web|url=https://11freunde.de/artikel/wie-david-wagner-schalke-wiederbelebt/page/1|title=Wagners größte Leistung|first=Ron|last=Ulrich|work=11 Freunde|publisher=11 Freunde GmbH & Co.

Wagner was a [[Journeyman (sports)|journeyman]] striker for his playing career, playing primarily for [[1. FSV Mainz 05|Mainz 05]], [[SV Darmstadt 98|Darmstadt 98]], [[FC Gütersloh 2000|FC Gütersloh]], and [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]]. He also had short stints at [[SV Waldhof Mannheim|Waldhof Mannheim]], [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] and [[TSG Weinheim]] and Germania Pfungstadt. He enjoyed his best spell at Mainz scoring 19 times in his four years at the club. Former teammate and lifelong friend [[Jürgen Klopp]] recalled that "he wasn't very consistent, even if he does not want to hear it ... He was a big talent, but not every day. He was a very young player when he came from Eintracht Frankfurt to Mainz, a very skilled boy, very quick, a good striker."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Who is new Schalke coach David Wagner?|url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/who-is-david-wagner-new-schalke-coach-huddersfield-borussia-dortmund-1541|access-date=2 February 2021|website=bundesliga.com|publisher= (official Bundesliga website)|language=en}}</ref> He was part of the Schalke squad that won the [[1997 UEFA Cup Final|1997 UEFA Cup]].

== International career ==
In the mid-1990s, Wagner was one of several German-born players called up by [[United States men's national soccer team]] coach [[Steve Sampson]] due to their ancestry, along with [[Thomas Dooley]] and [[Michael Mason (soccer)|Michael Mason]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Grahame L. |title=A Talent Search Through Cyberspace |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-02-10-sp-27207-story.html |access-date=17 September 2022 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=10 February 1997}}</ref> Wagner made his debut in a friendly 3–1 win over [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] in Los Angeles on 30 August 1996, in which he was substituted at half-time for [[Brian McBride]]. He made five appearances the following year and two more in 1998, all but one as a starter.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wagner, David |url=https://www.national-football-teams.com/player/28278/David_Wagner.html |publisher=National Football Teams |access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=1996 Lineups |url=https://www.ussoccer.com/mens-national-team/lineups/1996-lineups |publisher=US Soccer |access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref>

In April 1997, after [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] lost to the United States in a [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|World Cup qualifying]] match in which Wagner played, the [[Canadian Soccer Association]] complained to FIFA that Wagner should be ineligible to play for the United States based on his appearances for Germany's youth teams. On 2 May 1997, FIFA announced that Wagner was eligible to play for the United States because his games with the German teams were exhibitions, not official matches.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wagner Gets Approval for U.S. Team |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/02/sports/wagner-gets-approval-for-us-team.html |access-date=15 January 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=2 May 1997}}</ref> However, Wagner was rarely called into the U.S. team afterwards and he was not named to the squad for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Longman |first1=Jere |title=SOCCER; U.S. Names Experienced World Cup Team |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/06/sports/soccer-us-names-experienced-world-cup-team.html |access-date=17 September 2022 |work=The New York Times |date=6 May 1998}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
===Borussia Dortmund II===
Following his playing career, Wagner became a [[Manager (association football)|manager]], working mostly with his former [[1. FSV Mainz 05|1. Mainz 05]] teammate [[Jürgen Klopp]].

===Huddersfield Town===
[[File:David Wagner 2018.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wagner managing Huddersfield in 2018]]
On 5 November 2015, Wagner was appointed manager of English club [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] following the departure of [[Chris Powell]].<ref>{{cite news|title=David Wagner: Huddersfield name ex-Borussia Dortmund man as boss|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34733422|access-date=5 November 2015|publisher=BBC|date=5 November 2015}}</ref> He brought Christoph Bühler, who had left Borussia Dortmund on 1 November 2015, with him as his assistant.<ref name="BD-Liverpool"/><ref name="Guardian Wagner">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/05/huddersfield-town-appoint-david-wagner-manager |title=Huddersfield appoint former Dortmund reserves manager David Wagner |agency=Press Association |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=5 November 2015 |access-date=6 November 2015}}</ref>

In the summer of 2016, Wagner brought in 13 players from across the continent, including [[Danny Ward (Welsh footballer)|Danny Ward]], [[Chris Löwe]], and [[Aaron Mooy]].
