'''Douglas Ernest Livermore''' (born 27 December 1947) is a former professional football player and manager.

==Playing career==
Livermore began his career with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] where he came through the youth system to eventually sign professional forms on 1 November 1965 as an 18-year-old. He made his debut three years later when he appeared as a second-half substitute for [[Tony Hateley]] on 20 April 1968 in a 1–0 league defeat to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]]. Livermore was unable to replace his rival for the right sided midfield role, [[Ian Callaghan]].

After 18 first team appearances for the Reds, Livermore moved to [[Norfolk]] club [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on 26 November 1970. Doug had a fairly successful time at [[Carrow Road]] where he helped the club to win the 1971–72 [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] championship, thus gaining promotion the top flight of English football. He was also part of the City side that lost 1–0 to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the 1973 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final, the first time the Canaries had reached a [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] showpiece final. During his spell at Norwich the creative midfielder played 139 times, scoring 6 goals, which would have been a higher figure but for the injuries he endured whilst at Carrow Road.

Livermore spent time at [[AFC Bournemouth]] on loan, making ten appearances, before he signed for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in August 1975. Whilst at [[Ninian Park]] he played 88 times scoring 5 goals. Livermore then joined [[Chester City F.C.|Chester]] in October 1977 and was a regular until the end of the [[1978–79 in English football|1978–79 season]], appearing 71 times and scoring six goals. Livermore was a key part of the Chester side that finished fifth in [[Division Three]] (now League One) in [[1977–78 in English football|1977–78]], their highest finish in the last 60 years.

Chester would prove to be the final port of call in his playing career, as he retired and took up his first position in coaching back at Ninian Park with Cardiff.

==Coaching and managerial career==
After two years at Cardiff City, Livermore returned to another of his former clubs Norwich, where he became the Reserve team manager in 1980. Whilst at Norwich he also took a job on the coaching staff of [[Wales national football team|Wales]], a job where he had some success at as he helped to guide them to the 1980 [[British Home Championship|Home International]] title.

In August 1981, he moved onto [[Swansea City F.C.|Swansea City]] to take up a similar role to the one he had just left. He had joined up with another former Liverpool player [[John Toshack]]. During his time at Swansea, he had a two-month spell as caretaker manager in 1983 when Toshack left the club.

He was also an assistant of [[Mike England]] with the [[Wales national football team]] during the 1980s.

He then moved onto Spurs where again he was Reserve team manager and also took the role of first team coach in July 1991, when manager [[Terry Venables]] became chief executive and first team coach [[Peter Shreeves]] became Team Manager.

[[1991–92 in English football|1991–92]] was a disappointing season for defending [[FA Cup]] winners Tottenham. Despite reaching the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] quarter-finals and having striker [[Gary Lineker]] score 28 league goals in his final season for the club, their league form was dismal as they suffered 20 defeats and finished 15th in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] – below much less favoured teams including [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].

Shreeves was axed, and Livermore was promoted to the role of Team Manager for the [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93 season]] – the first season of the [[Premier League]]. They finished eighth in the Premier league thanks largely to the efforts of 21-goal striker [[Teddy Sheringham]] as well as promising youngsters including [[Nick Barmby]] and [[Darren Anderton]], but their hopes of silverware were ended by local rivals [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], who beat them in the [[FA Cup]] semi-final and went on to win the trophy.

Chairman [[Alan Sugar]] dismissed Venables at the end of the 1992–93 season, and this also meant the end of the Livermore-Clemence managerial partnership, as [[Ossie Ardiles]] was appointed manager.

On 28 January 1994, Livermore made a football comeback as assistant to [[Roy Evans]] at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. He helped Evans guide Liverpool to [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] glory in 1995 and to runners-up spot in the [[FA Cup]] in 1996, and remained at the club following the appointment of [[Gérard Houllier]] as joint manager alongside Evans for the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99 season]]. But Evans did not enjoy his partnership with Houllier, and resigned in November 1998, with Livermore following him out of the [[Anfield]] exit door.

Livermore returned to football early in 1999 as joint assistant alongside [[Peter Shreeves]] at Premier League strugglers [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], where he worked under [[Ron Atkinson]]. The management team were unable to save Forest from relegation to Division One, and were axed in favour of former [[England national football team|England]] captain [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]] for the [[1999–2000 in English football|1999–2000 season]].

Livermore then became assistant manager to [[Bruce Rioch]] at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], and was retained for the [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01 season]], when Rioch resigned to make way for [[Bryan Hamilton]]. Hamilton quit in January to be succeeded by [[Nigel Worthington]], and Livermore was part of the management team which secured Norwich's promotion to the Premier League as Division One champions in 2004. However, Norwich's Premier League comeback lasted just one season before they were relegated. Worthington was sacked in the autumn of 2006 after failing to get Norwich back into the Premier League, but Livermore remained at [[Carrow Road]] as assistant to new manager [[Peter Grant (footballer, born 1965)|Peter Grant]], until finally leaving on 9 February 2007 after nearly eight years on the club's coaching staff.

He then linked up with [[Nigel Worthington]] during the final weeks of the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07 season]] as assistant to Worthington in his role as caretaker manager of [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. The pair steered Leicester to survival in the [[Football League Championship]] but were not rewarded with long-term contracts and left the club.
