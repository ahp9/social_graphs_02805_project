'''Brian Howard Clough''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|ʌ|f}} {{respell|KLUF}}; 21 March 1935 – 20 September 2004) was an English [[Association football|football]] player and [[Manager (association football)|manager]], primarily known for his successes as a manager with [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. He is one of [[List of First Division and Premier League winning managers#By individual|four managers]] to have won the English league with two different clubs. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2019/08/20/50-greatest-football-managers-all-time | title=The 50 Greatest Football Managers of All Time | date=20 August 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2019/07/29/brian-clough-maverick-managers-all-time-best-xi | title=Brian Clough: The Maverick Manager's All-Time Best XI | date=29 July 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/10-best-managers-time-according-30938115 | title=10 best managers of all time according to AI as Klopp and Ancelotti snubbed | website=[[Daily Mirror]] | date=15 September 2023 }}</ref> Charismatic, outspoken and often controversial, his achievements with Derby and Forest, two clubs with little prior history of success, are rated among the greatest in football history.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3673824.stm |title=Stars pay tribute to Clough |work=BBC News  |date=21 September 2004 |access-date=11 July 2009}}</ref> His teams were also noted for playing attractive football and for their good sportsmanship.<ref>{{cite news|first=Matthew |last=Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/sep/22/sport.comment |title=What they said about |work=The Guardian |access-date=14 June 2012 |location=London |date=22 September 2004}}</ref> Despite applying several times and being a popular choice for the job, he was never appointed [[England national football team manager|England manager]] and has been dubbed the "greatest manager [[England national football team|England]] never had".<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tv_and_radio/inside_sport/8824688.stm |title=Brian Clough: The greatest manager England never had? |work=BBC News |date=15 July 2010 |access-date=14 June 2012}}</ref>

Clough played as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for Middlesbrough and Sunderland, scoring 251 league goals in 274 matches; he remains one of the [[Football League]]'s [[List of footballers in England and Scotland by number of league goals|highest goalscorers]]. He won two England caps. He entered management after his playing career was ended by a serious injury at the age of 29. As a manager, Clough was closely associated with [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]], who served as his assistant manager at several clubs in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. He is also remembered for giving frequent radio and television interviews in which he made controversial remarks about players, other managers and the overall state of the game. In 1965, he took the manager's job at Fourth Division <!-- READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING TO HARTLEPOOL Known as Hartlepools, with an 's', at the time -->[[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepools United]] and appointed [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]] as his assistant, the start of an enduring partnership that would bring them success at several clubs over the next two decades. In 1967, the duo moved on to [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] Derby County who, in [[1968–69 in English football|1968–69]], were promoted as Second Division champions and, [[1971–72 in English football|three years later]], crowned [[List of English football champions|champions of England]] for the first time in the club's history. In [[1972–73 European Cup|1973]], they reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. By this point, Clough's relationship with chairman [[Sam Longson]] had deteriorated; he and Taylor resigned.

An eight-month spell in charge of [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] club [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] followed, before Clough (without Taylor) returned north in the summer of 1974 to become manager of [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. This was widely regarded as a surprise appointment, given his previous outspoken criticism of the Leeds players and their manager [[Don Revie]]. He was sacked after just 44 days in the job, but within months, he had joined Second Division Nottingham Forest, where he was re-united with Taylor in the summer of 1976. In 1977, Forest were promoted to the top flight and the following season won the league title (the first in the club's history), making Clough one of only four managers to have won the English league with two clubs. Forest also won two consecutive European Cups (in [[1979 European Cup Final|1979]] and [[1980 European Cup Final|1980]]) and two [[Football League Cup|League Cups]] ([[1978 Football League Cup Final|1978]] and [[1979 Football League Cup Final|1979]]), before Taylor retired in 1982. Clough stayed on as Forest manager for another decade and won two more League Cups ([[1989 Football League Cup Final|1989]] and [[1990 Football League Cup Final|1990]]) and reached the [[FA Cup]] final in [[1991 FA Cup Final|1991]], but could not emulate his earlier successes. Forest were relegated from the [[Premier League]] in 1993, after which Clough retired from football.

==Childhood==
[[File:11 Valley Road, Grove Hill.jpg|left|upright|thumb|11 Valley Road, Grove Hill]]

Brian Howard Clough was born on Thursday, 21 March 1935<ref>{{Hugman|3684|access-date=26 January 2025}}</ref> at 11 Valley Road, an inter-war council house in [[Grove Hill, Middlesbrough|Grove Hill]], [[Middlesbrough]], [[North Riding of Yorkshire]],<ref>{{cite web|author=<!--lead container name-->Brian Clough |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/tees/content/articles/2007/05/15/brian_clough_feature.shtml |title=Tees – People – Brian Clough |publisher=BBC  |date=16 May 2007 |access-date=11 July 2009}}</ref> He was the sixth of nine children of a local [[sweet shop]] worker, later sugar boiler and then manager.

If anyone should be grateful for their upbringing, for their mam and dad, I'm that person. I was the kid who came from a little part of paradise." On his upbringing in Middlesbrough, Clough claimed that it was "not the most well-appointed place in the world, but to me it was heaven". "Everything I have done, everything I've achieved, everything that I can think of that has directed and affected my life – apart from the drink – stemmed from my childhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football.co.uk/derby_county/theres_only_one_brian_clough_why_we_-_and_some_leeds_fans_-_love_old_big_ead_and_his_green_jumper_rss70081.shtml |title=Theres only one Brian Clough Why we – and some Leeds fans – love Old Big Ead and his green jumper – Derby County News from |publisher=football.co.uk |date=11 March 2009 |access-date=11 July 2009}}</ref> Maybe it was the constant sight of Mam, with eight children to look after, working from morning until night, working harder than you or I have ever worked."

Clough failed his [[Eleven-plus]] examination and attended Marton Grove Secondary Modern School.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brianclough.com/boro_statue.htm |title=Middlesbrough'S Statue |publisher=Brianclough.com |date=16 May 2007 |access-date=11 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329203552/http://www.brianclough.com/boro_statue.htm |archive-date=29 March 2009 }}</ref> He later admitted in his autobiography, ''Walking on Water'', that he had neglected his lessons in favour of sport, although at school he became Head Boy. He also said that cricket, rather than football, was his first love as a youngster, and that he would have rather scored a test century at [[Lord's]] than a hat-trick at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. He left school in 1950 without any qualifications, to work at [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ltlf.co.uk/managers/clough_brian.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504033417/http://www.ltlf.co.uk/managers/clough_brian.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 May 2006 |title=lost that loving feeling – Brian Clough, 1935–2004 |publisher=Ltlf.co.uk |date=21 March 1935 |access-date=11 July 2009 }}</ref> and did his [[National Service Act 1948|national service]] in the [[RAF Regiment]] between 1953 and 1955.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britisharmedforces.org/pages/nat_brian_clough.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120802011429/http://www.britisharmedforces.org/pages/nat_brian_clough.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2012 |title=British Armed Forces & National Service |publisher=Britisharmedforces.org |access-date=11 July 2009 }}</ref>

{{Quote box|quote="I played with some great players and I think Cloughie was a great finisher. He was a powerful lad and both his timing and positional play were excellent. You placed him in that bracket as [[Roger Hunt]], but in more modern terms he was very similar to [[Mark Hughes]] when it came to volleying. The one thing, right or wrong, that he insisted on was that he played down the middle because, he reasoned, that was where he scored, not out wide so why should I run wide. That was his only failing.

Clough played for Great Broughton Juniors and, while working for ICI, [[Billingham Synthonia F.C.|Billingham Synthonia]] (scoring three goals in four games<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.synners.co.uk/history/ | title=Club history | publisher=BSFC | access-date=29 May 2021 | archive-date=6 October 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201006221511/https://www.synners.co.uk/history/ | url-status=dead }}</ref>) before his [[national service]] in the [[RAF]] between 1953 and 1955. He combined playing football in the forces, though he was never selected for the [[RAF]] National team,<ref name = "forces">{{cite web | title=Brian Howard Clough, MBE | url=https://www.britisharmedforces.org/pages/nat_brian_clough.htm | publisher=British Armed Forces | access-date=29 May 2021}}<br />{{cite web | url=https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/brian-clough-derby-forest-birthday-3972439.amp | title=Whip round' – Derby County fans share their favourite Brian Clough stories | work=[[Derby Telegraph]] | date=22 March 2020 | access-date=29 May 2021}}</ref> and playing for the [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Boro]] third team when on leave.<ref name = "forces"/>

===Middlesbrough===
Following this, he became a prolific striker for his home town club [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] since his debut in the [[1955–56 Middlesbrough F.C. season|1955–56 season]] and an impressive [[1956–57 Middlesbrough F.C. season|1956–57 season]] now as starter, scoring 204 goals in 222 league matches for Boro,<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web | url=http://www.brianclough.com/new_page_4.htm | title=Brian Clough's career information from brianclough.com | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406162657/http://www.brianclough.com/new_page_4.htm | archive-date=6 April 2008 }}</ref> including 40 or more goals in four consecutive seasons, being [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] topscorer in two of them: [[1958–59 Middlesbrough F.C. season|1958–59]] and [[1959–60 Middlesbrough F.C. season|1959–60]]. However, Clough also regularly submitted transfer requests since the [[1957–58 Middlesbrough F.C. season|1957–58 season]] and had a tense relationship with some of his fellow players. He was especially irked by Boro's leaky defence, which conceded goals as regularly as he scored them. In the [[1960–61 Middlesbrough F.C. season|1960–61 season]] after a 6–6 draw against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], Clough sarcastically asked his teammates how many goals they would have to score in order to win a match.<ref name="robstewart"/> He also publicly accused some of his teammates of betting against the team and deliberately letting in goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.middlesbrough-mad.co.uk/feat/edx5/brian_clough_21448/index.shtml |title=Brian Clough |publisher=Middlesbrough-mad.co.uk |date=31 October 2001 |access-date=14 June 2012}}</ref> While at Middlesbrough, Clough became acquainted with goalkeeper [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]], with whom he would later form a successful managerial partnership at several clubs. 

===Sunderland===

In July 1961, one of Clough's transfer requests was finally accepted and he moved to Boro's [[Tees–Wear derby|local rivals]] [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] for £55,000 scoring 34 goals in the [[1961–62 Sunderland A.F.C. season|1961–62 season]]. With Sunderland, Clough scored a total of 63 goals in 74 matches.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> In the [[1962–63 Sunderland A.F.C. season|1962–63]] season, Clough had scored 24 league goals by December as Sunderland pushed for promotion. In a match against [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] at [[Roker Park]] on 26 December 1962, in icy conditions and torrential rain, Clough was put through on goal and collided with goalkeeper, [[Chris Harker (footballer)|Chris Harker]]. Clough tore the [[medial collateral ligament|medial]] and [[cruciate ligament]]s in his knee, an injury which in that era usually ended a player's career. He returned two years later, but could manage only three games and then retired from playing at the age of 29.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0253-0d81cad2d50b-a149110db9bb-1000--in-profile-brian-clough/|title=In profile: Brian Clough|publisher=UEFA|date=28 August 2016|access-date=20 September 2018}}</ref>

Clough's manager at Sunderland was [[Alan Brown (English footballer)|Alan Brown]], a disciplinarian credited as a big influence on Clough. Brown inspired fear, imposed a strict code of conduct and would fine players for minor transgressions. He once upbraided Clough for talking to a friend during a training session. Such traits would later be adopted by Clough himself when he became a manager.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/championsleague/archive/2010/01/27/the-men-who-made-brian-clough.aspx |title=The men who made Brian Clough |publisher=Fourfourtwo.com |access-date=14 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629083949/http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/championsleague/archive/2010/01/27/the-men-who-made-brian-clough.aspx |archive-date=29 June 2012 }}</ref>

Of the players who have scored over 200 goals in the English leagues, Clough has the highest goals-per-game ratio of 0.916,<ref>using data from https://www.rsssf.org/tablese/engtops-allt.html</ref> and has the second highest ratio in the [[List of footballers in England and Scotland by number of league goals|list that includes the Scottish leagues]].

===England===
Clough played twice for the [[England national football team]], against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] on 17 October 1959 and [[Sweden men's national football team|Sweden]] on 28 October 1959, without scoring, although hitting the crossbar and post against Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1946-60/1959-60/M0336Swe1959.html|title=England Match No. 336 – Sweden – 28 October 1959 – Match Summary and Report|website=www.englandfootballonline.com|accessdate=13 March 2025}}</ref>

==Management career==

=== <!-- READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING TO HARTLEPOOL Known as Hartlepools, with an 'S', at the time -->Hartlepools United===
After a short spell coaching the [[Sunderland A.F.C. Reserves and Academy|Sunderland youth team]], in October 1965, Clough was offered the manager's job at <!-- READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING TO HARTLEPOOL Known as Hartlepools, with an 'S', at the time --> [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepools United]] (from 1977 the club became known as Hartlepool United). He accepted and immediately asked [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]] (then managing non-league [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]]) to join him as his assistant. At the age of 30, Clough was then the youngest manager in the league. Hartlepools were perennial strugglers and had repeatedly had to apply for re-election to the Football League, having finished in the bottom two of the Fourth Division five times in the past six seasons. Such was the club's perilous financial state in the [[1965–66 Hartlepools United F.C. season|1965–66 season]], Clough had to tour local pubs raising money to keep the club afloat and even applied for a coach driver's licence to drive the team to away matches.

On 15 November 1966, the then chairman, Ernest Ord, who was known for playing mind games with managers, sacked Clough's assistant Peter Taylor, claiming he could not afford to pay him anymore. Clough refused to accept it so Ord sacked him as well. However, there was a boardroom [[coup d'état|coup]] where the other board members refused to ratify the two sackings and which instead saw Ord ousted as chairman. Both Clough and Taylor were reinstated. Hartlepools' fortunes gradually improved and the club finished in a creditable eighth place in [[1966–67 Hartlepools United F.C. season|1966–67]]. Their Hartlepools team featured three players who would play for Clough and Taylor at other clubs in the future: [[Les Green]], who would be goalkeeper in Derby's promotion-winning side of 1969, [[Tony Parry]] who Clough signed for Derby in 1972 in what is seen as a helpful gesture to his former club who needed funds from transfers and a 16-year-old [[John McGovern (footballer, born 1949)|John McGovern]], who would later be signed by Clough at Derby County, Leeds United and Nottingham Forest, winning several major trophies in the process. On 14 May 1967, the two men then joined [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] side [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] as manager and assistant manager. They took charge on 1 June 1967. In the following season, Hartlepools were promoted for the first time in their history.

===Derby County===
[[File:Brian Clough and Peter Taylor Statue Derby.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Brian Clough and Peter Taylor Statue at Pride Park]]

Derby County had been rooted in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] for a decade before Clough's arrival, and had been outside the top flight for a further five years, their only major trophy being the [[FA Cup]] in 1946.

In Clough's [[1967–68 Derby County F.C. season|first season]], the club finished one place lower than in the previous season, but he had started to lay the foundations for his future success by signing several new players, among them [[Roy McFarland]], [[John O'Hare]], [[John McGovern (footballer, born 1949)|John McGovern]], [[Alan Hinton]] and Les Green. Of the inherited squad, 11 players departed and only four were retained: [[Kevin Hector]], [[Alan Durban]], [[Ron Webster]] and [[Colin Boulton]]. Clough also sacked the club secretary, the groundsman and the chief scout, along with two tea ladies he caught laughing after a Derby defeat.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/mar/11/brian-clough-film |title=David Lacey on one of Britain's greatest football managers |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 11 March 2009|access-date=11 July 2009 }}</ref> With the additional signings of [[Dave Mackay (footballer born 1934)|Dave Mackay]] and [[Willie Carlin]] in [[1968–69 Derby County F.C. season|1968–69]], Clough and Taylor's management led Derby to become champions of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], establishing the club record of 22 matches without defeat on the way and the team was promoted to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] for the [[1969–70 Derby County F.C. season|1969–70 season]].

Clough was universally seen as a hard but fair manager, who insisted on clean play from his players and brooked no stupid questions from the press. He insisted on being called "Boss" and earned great respect from his peers for his ability to turn a game to his and his team's advantage. Derby's first season back in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] saw them finish fourth, their best league finish for over twenty years, but, due to financial irregularities, the club was banned from Europe the following season and fined £10,000.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In [[1970–71 Derby County F.C. season|1970–71]], the club finished ninth. In February 1971, Clough bolstered his squad by signing [[Colin Todd]] for a British record £175,000 on the same day Clough had denied that Derby were about to buy Todd. In the [[1971–72 Derby County F.C. season|1971–72]] season, after tussling with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for the title, Derby finally topped the league table by one point after playing their final match, a 1–0 win over Liverpool. [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] did temporarily top the league after playing their last match, but had a slim chance of winning the title due to outstanding fixtures between the clubs directly below them. Peter Taylor took the players on holiday to [[Majorca]] as the clubs beneath them played their final matches. Clough was not with the squad, instead holidaying in the [[Isles of Scilly]] with his family and elderly parents. Both Liverpool and Leeds United had a chance to overtake Derby by winning their final matches (played a week later due to fixture congestion) but Leeds lost to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] and Liverpool drew at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], meaning Derby were league champions for the first time in their 88-year history. The team and management were on holiday when receiving the news they were champions.

====Feud with the Derby County board of directors====

On 27 April 1972, less than two weeks before taking Derby to the league title, Clough and Taylor had briefly resigned for a few hours to manage [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] before changing their minds after Longson offered them more money.

In August 1972, Clough refused to go on an arranged pre-season tour of the Netherlands and [[West Germany]] unless he could take his family with him. Derby chairman Sam Longson told him that it was a working trip and not a holiday, so Clough put Taylor in charge of the tour instead and refused to go. The club did not contest the [[1972 FA Charity Shield|FA Charity Shield]] that year.

On 24 August 1972, Clough and Taylor signed [[David Nish]] from [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] for a then-record transfer fee of £225,000, without consulting the Derby board.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/bob.dunning/thirty27.htm |title=Thirty Years Ago – August 1972 |publisher=Dspace.dial.pipex.com |date=9 January 2005 |access-date=29 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418202326/http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/bob.dunning/thirty27.htm |archive-date=18 April 2010 }}</ref> Afterwards, Jack Kirkland, a director, warned Clough and Taylor there would be no more expensive buys like Nish. Then, in early September 1972, after the team had defeated [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] 2–1 at the [[Baseball Ground]], Clough criticised the Derby County fans, stating that "They started chanting only near the end when we were a goal in front. I want to hear them when we are losing. They are a disgraceful lot". In the same interview, Clough also verbally attacked the club's board of directors for their policies. The following day, board chairman Sam Longson apologised to the fans and dissociated himself from Clough's remarks.

That [[1972–73 Derby County F.C. season|1972–73 season]], Derby failed to retain their title, finishing seventh, but reached the semi-finals of the [[1972–73 European Cup|European Cup]] in April 1973, when they were knocked out by [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] 3–1 on aggregate.<ref>{{cite news|language=it|url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,0009/articleid,1499_02_1974_0093A_0025_23123597/|title=La Juve era già assolta|work=La Stampa |location=Italy|page=9|date=22 April 1974|access-date=11 April 2011}}</ref> During the first leg in [[Turin]], Clough was aggrieved by the performance of the match referee, whom he believed had been influenced and possibly bribed to favour the Italian side.<ref>{{harvnb|Clough|2002|pp=201–203}}</ref> After the game, Clough refused to speak to the Italian reporters, saying: "No cheating bastards do I talk to.

It was these sorts of frequent, outspoken comments – particularly against football's establishment, such as the [[The Football Association|FA]] and club directors, and figures in the game such as [[Matt Busby]], [[Alan Hardaker]], [[Alf Ramsey]], [[Don Revie]] and Len Shipman, along with players such as [[Billy Bremner]], [[Norman Hunter (footballer)|Norman Hunter]] and [[Peter Lorimer]] – combined with Clough's increased media profile, that eventually led to his falling out with the Rams' chairman, Sam Longson, and the Derby County board of directors.

On 5 August 1973, Clough put his name to an article in the ''[[Sunday Express]]'' headlined "I Would Put Leeds in Division Two – Brian Clough lashes Soccer's bosses for letting off Don Revie's 'bad boys,'"<ref>{{cite web |title=The Definitive History of Leeds United – 1972/73 – Part 3 – The Revie-Clough wrangle |url=http://www.mightyleeds.co.uk/seasons/197273part3.htm |website=www.mightyleeds.co.uk |access-date=5 May 2021}}</ref> which savaged [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]'s disciplinary record, stating that Revie should be fined for encouraging his players in their unsporting behaviour and Leeds relegated to the Second Division. Clough also said that "The men who run football have missed the most marvellous chance of cleaning up the game in one swoop" and went on to say "The trouble with football's disciplinary system is that those who sat in judgement being officials of other clubs might well have a vested interest."

Days afterwards, Clough was charged with bringing the game into disrepute, but he was cleared on 14 November after he had later resigned from Derby. In September 1973, Clough travelled to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United's]] [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] and personally made a £400,000 bid for [[Bobby Moore]], a player he long admired, and [[Trevor Brooking]]. West Ham manager [[Ron Greenwood]] informed Clough that neither was available but that he would pass his offer onto the West Ham board of directors anyway. Clough never told Derby's chairman, secretary or any other board members at Derby about the bid. Longson found out four months later during a chance conversation with Eddie Chapman, West Ham's secretary at the time, but by then Clough was no longer the Derby County manager.

====Resignation from Derby County====

During the [[1973–74 Derby County F.C. season|1973–74 season]], on 11 October 1973, Longson called for the sackings of both Clough and Taylor at a board meeting, but did not gain the support that was needed. Earlier that week, Longson had demanded that Clough stop writing newspaper articles and making television appearances, and prohibited both Clough and Taylor drinking alcohol on Derby County premises. Two days later, following a 1–0 win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]], club director Jack Kirkland demanded to know what Taylor's exact role within the club was, and instructed Taylor to meet him at the ground two days later to explain. On the same day, Longson accused Clough of making a [[V-sign]] at Matt Busby and chairman [[Louis Edwards]] and demanded that he apologise. Clough refused, and admitted later that he did make a V-sign, but it was aimed at Longson, not Busby or Edwards: he blamed Longson for providing too few tickets and seating for players' and staff's wives, including his own and Taylor's.

Clough and Taylor hoped to oust Longson as chairman, as they had done with Ord seven years earlier, but failed. Both Clough and Taylor resigned on the evening of 15 October 1973, and the resignation was accepted by Sam Longson the following morning, to widespread uproar from Rams fans, who demanded the board's resignation along with Clough and Taylor's reinstatement at the following home game against Leicester City four days later. That evening, Clough appeared on ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' and attacked football directors for their apparent "lack of knowledge" of football.

That week, Clough, as a television football pundit, memorably called [[Poland national football team|Poland]] goalkeeper [[Jan Tomaszewski]] a "circus clown in gloves" before the crucial [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifier with England at Wembley.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/12/jan-tomaszewski-poland-clown|title=Jan Tomaszewski: A man haunted for ever after being called a clown|first=Maciej|last=Slominski|date=12 October 2013|website=The Guardian|access-date=3 April 2018}}</ref> The match, which England had to win in order to qualify for the [[1974 World Cup]] finals, ended 1–1, and Tomaszewski made numerous magnificent saves, some of them unconventionally, to ensure his nation qualified for the finals at England's expense. When commentator [[Brian Moore (commentator)|Brian Moore]] said "You call him a clown, Brian, but he saved his side", Clough insisted "Would you want him in your team every week?"{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The six years at Derby County had brought Clough to the attention of the wider football world. According to James Lawton, "Derby was the wild making of Brian Clough. He went there a young and urgent manager who had done impressive work deep in his own little corner of the world at Hartlepools. He left surrounded by fascination and great celebrity: abrasive, infuriating, but plugged, immovably, into a vein of the nation."<ref>James Lawton, ''The Independent'', 10 January 2009</ref>

===Brighton & Hove Albion===
Such was the loyalty to Clough that, along with himself and Taylor, scouts and backroom staff completed the walk out, following the pair for their brief spell with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1576977.stm |title=Obituary: Brian Clough |work=BBC News  |date=20 September 2004 |access-date=11 July 2009}}</ref> He proved less successful on the south coast than with his previous club, winning only 12 of his 32 games in charge of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] side. Whereas nineteen months earlier he led Derby County to the league title and eight months earlier Clough was managing a team playing Juventus in the European Cup, he was now managing a club who, just after his appointment as manager, lost to non-league [[Walton & Hersham F.C.|Walton & Hersham]] 4–0 at home in an FA Cup replay. On 1 December 1973, his side lost 8–2 at home to [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]]. Brighton eventually finished in 19th place that [[1973–74 Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. season|1973–74 season]].

===Leeds United===
Clough left Brighton less than a year after his appointment, in July 1974, to become manager of [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], following [[Don Revie]]'s departure to become manager of [[England national football team|England]], though this time Taylor did not join him. Clough's move was very surprising given his previous outspoken criticism of both Revie, for whom Clough made no secret of his deep disdain, and the successful Leeds team's playing style, which Clough had publicly branded "dirty" and "cheating".<ref>{{cite news |last=Robinson |first=Paul |url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/leedsunited/Leeds-United39s-John-McGovern-talks.4323434.jp |title=Leeds United's John McGovern talks about Brian Clough era |newspaper=Yorkshire Evening Post |access-date=11 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821100855/http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/leedsunited/Leeds-United39s-John-McGovern-talks.4323434.jp |archive-date=21 August 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Furthermore, he had called for Leeds to be demoted to the Second Division as a punishment for their poor disciplinary record.

He lasted in the job only 44 days before he was sacked by the Leeds directors on 12 September 1974, after alienating many of Leeds' star players.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2009/03/27/brian-clough-in-pictures-re-live-his-44-days-at-leeds-united-115875-21232521/ |title=Brian Clough in pictures: Re-live his 44 days at Leeds United |work=Daily Mirror |location=UK |access-date=11 July 2009}}</ref> During one of the first training sessions he took for Leeds United, he reportedly said "You can all throw your medals in the bin because they were not won fairly."<ref>{{cite news|last=Robinson |first=Paul |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/the-ten-best-mass-insults-1799735.html?action=Popup&ino=8 |title=The Ten Best Mass Insults |work=The Independent |location=London |date= 9 October 2009|access-date=3 December 2013}}</ref> Until [[Darko Milanič]]'s winless six games in 2014,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29774801 |title=Darko Milanic: Leeds United part company with head coach |work=BBC Sport|date=25 October 2014}}</ref> he had the unenviable record of being Leeds United's least successful permanent manager, winning only one match from six games.

On the evening of his dismissal, Clough discussed his short reign at [[Elland Road]] with [[Yorkshire Television]]'s ''[[Calendar (News)|Calendar]]'' news programme.

Forest defeated [[Malmö FF|Malmö]] 1–0 in Munich's [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympiastadion]] in the [[1979 European Cup Final]]. Francis on his European debut scored with a back post header from Robertson's cross. In addition, Forest defeated [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the final 3–2 to retain the League Cup. Birtles scored twice, and Woodcock once. Forest finished second in the [[1978–79 Football League]], eight points behind Liverpool.

Forest defeated Everton 4–3 after extra time in the 1989 [[Full Members Cup]] final. They came back to defeat Luton Town 3–1 in the [[1989 Football League Cup Final|League Cup final]]. [[Nigel Clough]] scored two and [[Neil Webb]] one. Forest chased a unique cup treble in the [[1988–89 Nottingham Forest F.C. season|1988–89 season]], but tragedy struck a week after the League Cup win. Forest and Liverpool met for the second season in a row in the FA Cup semi-finals. The [[Hillsborough disaster]] claimed the lives of 97 Liverpool fans, and the match was abandoned after six minutes. When the rescheduled game took place, Forest struggled and Liverpool won 3–1. Forest finished third in the First Division for a second successive year. However, they were unable to compete in the [[UEFA Cup]] as English clubs were still banned from European competitions following the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster]]. [[Des Walker]] won the first of his four successive selections for the PFA Team of the Year.

[[Nigel Jemson]] scored as Forest defeated [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] 1–0 to retain the League Cup in 1990. Clough reached his only [[1991 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] in 1991. Pearce put Forest ahead after sixteen minutes, direct from a free kick against Tottenham Hotspur at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. Spurs won 2–1 after an extra-time own goal by Walker. [[Roy Keane]] declared himself fit to play in the final and was selected in preference to [[Steve Hodge]]. Keane later admitted he was not fit to play and that was why he had such an insignificant role in the final.<ref>"Keane; The Autobiography". Roy Keane, Penguin Publishing Group, {{ISBN|9780718193997}}</ref> English clubs were re-admitted to Europe for the [[1990-91 in English football|1990–91 season]]. English places in the competition were initially limited. 1990 League Cup winners Forest were not included. The only [[UEFA Cup]] place that season went to league runners-up [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].

In the summer of 1991, [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]'s league top scorer [[Teddy Sheringham]] set Forest's record signing fee at £2.1&nbsp;million. In that [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92]] season Forest defeated Southampton 3–2 after extra time in the Full Members Cup Final. [[Brian McClair]]'s solitary Manchester United goal defeated Forest in the [[1992 Football League Cup Final]]. Forest had played in seven domestic cup finals at Wembley in five seasons, winning five. Forest finished eighth in the league that season to earn a place in the new [[FA Premier League]].

Walker transferred in the summer 1992 to Italian side [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]]. On 16 August 1992, Forest defeated Liverpool 1–0 at home in the first ever televised live Premier League game. Sheringham scored the only goal against Liverpool. Only one week later, Sheringham transferred to Tottenham.

===Links with other jobs===
Clough was a popular choice to be appointed [[England national football team manager|England manager]] throughout the 1970s and 1980s. However, it was widely felt that the FA were unwilling to consider appointing him on account of his numerous outspoken comments about the English football authorities. He was interviewed for the job twice, in 1977 and 1982, but lost out to [[Ron Greenwood]] and [[Bobby Robson]] respectively. Such was the demand for Clough to be given the job that incumbent manager Robson told then-FA chairman Sir [[Bert Millichip]]: 'I'm having a rough time and everybody wants Brian – give the job to him. If he's successful, everybody's happy. If he fails, that's the end of the clamour for Brian Clough to be England manager'."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3691056.stm |title=Players lead Clough tribute |work=BBC News |date=26 September 2004 |access-date=14 June 2012}}</ref>

Following [[Mike England]]'s dismissal as manager of [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in February 1988, Clough was offered the position as manager of Wales on a part-time basis, something later done with [[John Toshack]].

Hartlepools<!-- READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING TO HARTLEPOOL Known as Hartlepools, with an S, at the time -->, Derby, Brighton and Forest, retired from football in 1982, bringing to an end their partnership. Several events had strained their friendship in the past: while at Derby, Taylor was riled when he learned that Clough had accepted a pay rise from Sam Longson without telling him; Taylor did not get one. Then, in 1980, Taylor released a book, ''With Clough, By Taylor'', which detailed their partnership, but he had not told Clough that he was writing the book.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.planetfootball.com/nostalgia/an-ode-to-peter-taylor-a-man-who-history-has-done-a-great-disservice/|accessdate=8 September 2021|title=An ode to Peter Taylor, a man who history has done a great disservice |website=Planet Football | date=15 August 2019 | first=Seb |last=Stafford-Bloor}}</ref> Six months after retiring, Taylor was appointed Derby County manager. When their teams met in the FA Cup third round on 8 January 1983 at the Baseball Ground, the two managers ignored each other and did not speak. Derby County won the match 2–0.

When Taylor signed [[John Robertson (footballer born 1953)|John Robertson]] from Forest without informing Clough on 21 May 1983, it was, according to Robertson, "the straw that broke the camel's back"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Robbo-Clough-Taylor-rift-fault/story-13503051-detail/story.html |title=Robbo: Clough, Taylor rift not my fault |publisher=Thisisderbyshire.co.uk |date=7 October 2011 |access-date=14 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130505113257/http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Robbo-Clough-Taylor-rift-fault/story-13503051-detail/story.html%23axzz2SPuqlyzo |archive-date=5 May 2013 }}</ref> and the two men would never speak again.

''Brian Clough: Nobody Ever Says Thank You: The Biography''</ref>

The rift had not been repaired by the time Taylor died in October 1990, but Clough and his family attended Taylor's funeral. According to Taylor's daughter Wendy, Clough was "deeply upset" by Taylor's death and telephoned her when he heard the news.<ref>{{cite web|first=Wendy |last=Dickinson |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2009/04/14/peter_wendy_taylor_feature.shtml |title=Peter Taylor, my father |publisher=BBC |date=17 April 2009 |access-date=14 June 2012}}</ref> Clough dedicated his autobiography in 1994 to Taylor, and he also paid tribute to him when he was given the freedom of Nottingham, as he did in September 1999 when a bust was unveiled of Clough at the [[City Ground]].

===Corruption allegations===
Clough was implicated in the 1990s "bungs" scandal in [[Football in England|English football]]. A "bung" was a euphemism for illicit payments made between parties to ensure player transfer deals went through.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/what-is-a-bung-why-is-it-illegal-eight-premier-league-managers-accused-illegal-payments-sam-a7334431.html|title=What is a bung?

Clough became involved in the scandal in June 1993 when he was [[Absolute privilege in English law|named in court]] by [[Alan Sugar]], then chairman of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. Sugar, who was the club's major shareholder, was taking legal action to sack [[Terry Venables]], the club's chief executive. Sugar testified in court that during the 1992 transfer of [[Teddy Sheringham]] from Nottingham Forest to Tottenham, Venables had told him that Clough "liked a bung".<ref>{{cite news|first=Henry |last=Winter |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/clough-wanted-cash-bung-sugar-claims-1490823.html |title=Clough wanted cash 'bung', Sugar claims |work=The Independent |date=11 June 1993 |access-date=14 June 2012 |location=London}}</ref> Sugar said he sanctioned a cash payment of £58,750, which he believed would be paid to an agent, but instead was handed over to [[Ronnie Fenton]], Clough's assistant at Forest.<ref name="Parry puzzled by Clough 'bungs'">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2004/09/23/sfnbos23.xml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529043450/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2004/09/23/sfnbos23.xml | url-status=dead | archive-date=29 May 2007 | title=Parry puzzled by Clough 'bungs'  | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Mihir | last=Bose | date=23 September 2004 | access-date=26 April 2010}}</ref>

After an inquiry by the FA, Clough was charged with misconduct but the case was dropped due to his ill health.

Much of Clough's retirement was spent concentrating on his fight against [[alcoholism]], ill-health and corruption allegations. His battle with alcoholism dated back to the 1970s and was chronicled in part by [[Duncan Hamilton (journalist)|Duncan Hamilton]] in his award-winning book ''Provided You Don't Kiss Me: 20 Years With Brian Clough''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/provided-you-dont-kiss-me-by-duncan-hamilton-763980.html |title=Provided You Don't Kiss Me, by Duncan Hamilton  |work=[[The Independent]] |first=Simon |last=Redfern |date=9 December 2007 |access-date=26 November 2012 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/29/literary-news |title=The week in books |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=John |last=Dugdale |date=28 November 2007 |access-date=26 November 2012 |location=London}}</ref> He considered applying for the job as manager of [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on the sacking of [[Graham Taylor]] on 13 November 1995. Nothing came of it, however, and Clough's managerial career was over.

In November 1994, Clough caused controversy over comments he made about the [[Hillsborough disaster]]. He wrote in his autobiography: "I will always remain convinced that those Liverpool fans who died were killed by Liverpool people. They brought the tragedy on themselves—they were drunk, unruly and disorderly." He defended the comments in an interview with [[Clive Anderson]]. In 2001, he said: "I now accept the investigations have made me realise I was misinformed. I wasn't trying to be vindictive or unsympathetic, but my opinion has altered over the years. It was never my intention to hurt anyone."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/brian-clough-see-light-over-3457927|title=Brian Clough DID see the light over Hillsborough – but it took him 12 years|first=Paddy|last=Shennan|date=25 March 2009|work=Liverpool Echo}}</ref>

Nottingham Forest honoured him by renaming the [[City Ground]]'s largest stand, the Executive Stand, the Brian Clough Stand. Clough was made an inaugural inductee of the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2002 in recognition of his success and influence as a manager. In 1993, he was awarded the [[freedom of the city]] of [[Nottingham]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1472206/Brian-Clough.html |title=Brian Clough |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=21 September 2004 |access-date=14 June 2012 |location=London}}</ref> In 2003, the city of [[Derby]] followed suit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/features/2003/05/clough/overview.shtml |title=Cloughie's big day |publisher=BBC |date=4 May 2003 |access-date=14 June 2012}}</ref> He wrote a column for ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' magazine up until his death.

On 4 April 1959, Clough married Barbara Glasgow in Middlesbrough; he later said that marrying Barbara was "the best thing I ever did". They went on to have three children: Simon, born on 15 June 1964, [[Nigel Clough|Nigel]], born on 19 March 1966, and Elizabeth, born on 31 May 1967. During the 1980s the Clough family went on to mentor a couple of underprivileged youngsters from Sunderland, brothers Craig and Aaron Bromfield after a chance encounter in the North East prior to a Forest fixture. Craig at one point ended up living with the Cloughs for a significant period of time, coming to see Brian as a second father—the arrangement ending when Craig was found to have been stealing from the family. Craig later published a book on his experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/30/brian-clough-and-me-if-it-wasnt-for-him-id-be-in-prison|title=Brian Clough and me: 'If it wasn't for him, I'd be in prison' &#124; Brian Clough |work= The Guardian|date=30 October 2021 |accessdate=13 April 2024 |last1=Hattenstone |first1=Simon }}</ref> Nigel also became a professional footballer and played under his father at Forest in the 1980s and 1990s.

In 2011, his family and friends contributed memories to a book entitled ''The Day I Met Brian Clough'', which also included recollections from fans and journalists.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.brianclough.com/theday.htm |title=The Day I Met Brian Clough |year=2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731111347/http://brianclough.com/theday.htm |archive-date=31 July 2013 }}</ref>

It was originally to have been held at [[Derby Cathedral]], but had to be moved because of demand for tickets.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3738032.stm |title=Clough memorial service switched |work=BBC News  |date=12 October 2004 |access-date=11 July 2009}}</ref>

After a long process of fundraising, Clough's home town of Middlesbrough commissioned a statue of him, which was unveiled on 16 May 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitmiddlesbrough.com/venues/albert-park |title=Albert Park |publisher=Middlesbrough Council |work=Love Middlesbrough |access-date=19 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624001445/http://www.visitmiddlesbrough.com/venues/albert-park |archive-date=24 June 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although there was a movement to erect a statue in his birthplace at [[Grove Hill, Middlesbrough|Grove Hill]], the site chosen was the town's [[Albert Park, Middlesbrough|Albert Park]], through which he usually walked on his way from home to [[Ayresome Park]], Middlesbrough's former stadium.<ref>[http://www.middlesbrough.gov.uk/ccm/content/news/middlesbrough-council-press-releases/clough-statue---cash-secured.en Press release]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from Middlesbrough council</ref>

==''The Damned United''==
The story of Clough's turbulent 44-day spell in charge of Leeds United was the subject of a novel by [[David Peace]] titled ''[[The Damned Utd]]'', published in 2006, which focuses on the rivalry between Clough and Don Revie. Despite critical acclaim, the novel was also the subject of controversy for its perceived negative portrayal of Clough as an obsessive, and for some historical inaccuracies. The publishers of the novel were successfully sued by Irish midfielder and former Leeds player [[Johnny Giles]]. He wrote: "Many of the things Peace talks about in the book never happened and, for that reason, I felt it necessary to go to the courts to establish that this was fiction based on fact and nothing more".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/publish-and-be-damned-giles-fights-back-for-revie-and-clough-2132719.html| work=The Independent | title=Publish and be Damned: Giles fights back for Revie and Clough|date=13 November 2010|access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/exclusive-clough-portrayal-helped-drive-giles-s-libel-bid-1-3025001| work=Yorkshire Post| title=Exclusive: Clough portrayal helped drive Giles's libel bid| date=12 November 2010| access-date=27 January 2020| archive-date=27 January 2020| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200127170325/https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/exclusive-clough-portrayal-helped-drive-giles-s-libel-bid-1-3025001| url-status=dead}}</ref> 
The Clough family expressed disappointment at the publication of the book.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nikkah|first=Royah|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/4952562/Football-manager-Brian-Cloughs-family-to-boycott-film-about-his-life.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/4952562/Football-manager-Brian-Cloughs-family-to-boycott-film-about-his-life.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=The Damned United: Football manager Brian Clough's family to boycott film about his life|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=7 March 2009}}{{cbignore}}</ref> It includes a scene with Clough in the Elland Road car park burning Revie's old desk, for which there is no factual source.<ref name =film/>

The book was later adapted into a film called ''[[The Damned United]]'', starring [[Michael Sheen]] and released in 2009. It too was successfully sued for defamation, this time by Dave Mackay, who in 2010 received an apology and an undisclosed sum from the producers. The Clough family declined to co-operate with the film, despite efforts by the film-makers to lighten the dark tone of the novel.<ref name = film>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/07/2 |title=Damned: Clough family boycott film of legendary manager's life |first=Owen |last=Gibson |work=The Guardian |date=7 March 2009 |access-date=15 February 2013 |location=London}}</ref>

==''Bloody Southerners''==
In 2018, a book chronicling Clough and Taylor's hitherto unwritten time in management at Brighton & Hove Albion, 'Bloody Southerners: Clough and Taylor's Brighton & Hove Albion Odyssey', was written by Spencer Vignes and published by [[Biteback Publishing]]. Clough and Taylor had joined Brighton in November 1973, and Vignes speaks to the Brighton players who played under them. Clough himself only stayed for a few months, before heading to Leeds United at the end of the season. Taylor, meanwhile, chose to honour his contract with club chairman [[Mike Bamber]], and stayed on as sole manager until the end of the 1975/76 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/history/new-book-sheds-light-brian-2077082|title=New book sheds light on Brian Clough's ill-fated spell in charge at Brighton|last=Smart|first=Andy|date=8 October 2018|work=Nottingham Post|access-date=20 September 2022}}</ref>
