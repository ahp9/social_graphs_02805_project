Despite his relative success in his two years at Leicester, he often had a very strained relationship with chairman [[Milan Mandaric]] and chief executive Lee Hoos. In the summer of 2010, Mandaric showed a consortium of potential club buyers round the club without Pearson's knowledge and invited [[Paulo Sousa]] to the second leg of the play-off semifinal. The club then allowed [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] to speak to him. Pearson said: "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out what's happening" – suggesting the club did not want to keep him.

===Return to Leicester City===
After Mandaric and Hoos had departed the club, Pearson was persuaded to rejoin [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] under their new ownership by chairman [[Vichai Raksriaksorn]], and after days of negotiations he was finally re-appointed as manager on 15 November 2011 with Leicester sitting 12th in the Championship.<ref name="Leicester City appoint Hull City's Nigel Pearson as boss">{{cite news |title=Leicester City appoint Hull City's Nigel Pearson as boss |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/15621888 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 November 2011 |access-date=28 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=English League Championship 2011–2012 : Table 6.11.2011|url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/league-championship/2011-2012/table/2011-11-06|publisher=Statto Organisation|access-date=1 December 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105035757/http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/league-championship/2011-2012/table/2011-11-06|archive-date=5 November 2011}}</ref> Pearson started well, taking seven points from his first three games, which took Leicester into the top six for the first time since he had last been at the club, over 18 months previously,<ref>{{cite web |title=Pearson Quick To Praise Players |url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10274~2532463,00.html |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |access-date=1 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202001540/http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0%2C%2C10274~2532463%2C00.html |archive-date=2 December 2011}}</ref> before Leicester faced the [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] side Pearson had left just 18 days earlier.

In March 2020, Pearson fell ill and isolated for ten days under [[COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19]] protocols. In June 2020, a blood test confirmed he had previously contracted the disease. While still at Watford he suffered from secondary symptoms, including an irregular heartbeat, high resting pulse and swollen lips that saw him miss a press conference, although he only informed a small number of staff at the club of his condition. In August and September 2020, after his departure from Watford, Pearson endured a bout of [[rheumatoid arthritis]] that saw him suffer with swollen joints.
