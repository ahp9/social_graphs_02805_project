==Coaching career==
===Beginnings===
Flores began his coaching career in 2001 by taking charge of Real Madrid's youth teams. After earning plaudits during his three seasons with the youth teams, he caught the eye of the newly promoted [[Getafe CF|Getafe]], also in Madrid.<ref name=Artist/>

After the [[2004–05 La Liga|2004–05 campaign]] with Getafe, in which they finished in 13th place, Flores was given the opportunity to coach his former club Valencia, succeeding [[Claudio Ranieri]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2005/05/30/futbol/1117473798.html|title=Quique Sánchez Flores, nuevo entrenador del Valencia|trans-title=Quique Sánchez Flores, new manager of Valencia|newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=es|date=30 May 2005|access-date=21 April 2018}}</ref> In his [[2005–06 La Liga|first year]], he guided them to third place and thus [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|qualified]] for the [[UEFA Champions League]] where the team went on to reach the quarter-finals, being knocked out by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.20minutos.es/deportes/noticia/reacciones-valencia-chelsea-221372/0/|title=Quique: "No estamos entre los cuatro mejores de Europa"|trans-title=Quique: "We are not among Europe's four best"|newspaper=[[20 minutos]]|language=es|date=11 April 2007|access-date=21 April 2018}}</ref>

During a match at Getafe on 30 March 2024, Sánchez Flores, of [[Gitanos|Spanish Gypsy]] ancestry, was the victim of racist abuse from behind the coaches' benches.
