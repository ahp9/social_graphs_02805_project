'''Ole Gunnar Solskjær''' ({{IPA|no|ˈûːlə ˈɡʉ̂nːɑr ˈsûːlʂæːr|-|No-Ole Gunnar Solskjær.ogg}}; born 26 February 1973) is a Norwegian professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former player, who was most recently the head coach of [[Süper Lig]] club [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]]. He spent the majority of his playing career with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and made 67 appearances for the [[Norway national football team|Norway national team]]. 

A [[Forward (association football)|forward]], Solskjær began his career in his native Norway with [[Clausenengen FK|Clausenengen]], where he scored 115 goals in 109 league appearances over five seasons, helping the club earn promotion to the [[Norwegian Second Division]] in 1993. He then moved to [[Molde FK|Molde]], newly promoted to the [[Eliteserien|highest league in Norway, Tippeligaen]], for the [[1995 Tippeligaen|1995 season]]. His goals helped Molde finish second and qualify for the [[1996–97 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]].

In July 1996, Solskjær joined Manchester United for a transfer fee of [[Pound sterling|£]]1.5&nbsp;million. Nicknamed "the Baby-faced Assassin", he made 366 appearances for United and scored 126 goals during a successful period for the club. Renowned as a "[[Substitute bench#Super-sub|super-sub]]" for his knack of scoring late goals off the [[Substitute (association football)| bench]], he famously netted the dramatic injury-time [[1999 UEFA Champions League final#Injury time|winner]] against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in the [[1999 UEFA Champions League final]]. That goal [[1998–99 Manchester United F.C. season|secured]] the [[Treble (association football)|treble]] for United, who had trailed 1–0 as the match entered stoppage time. 
He remained a regular player for the side until a serious knee injury sustained in 2003 began to plague his career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/solskjaer-s-career-on-knife-edge-after-injury-51088.html|title=Solskjaer's career on knife edge after injury|work=The Independent|date=9 August 2004}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.ukcom/article/the-big-interview-ole-gunnar-solskjaer-l08mldbm9jc|title=The Big Interview: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer|date=22 May 2005|website=www.thetimes.com|url-status=dead}}</ref> After several attempts to return, he announced his retirement from football in 2007.<ref name="retirement">{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11667_2690166,00.html |title=United stalwart retires |work=Sky Sports |first=Mark |last=Buckingham |date=27 August 2007 |access-date=25 April 2008}}</ref>

Solskjær remained at Manchester United after retiring, taking on both a coaching role and ambassadorial duties. In 2008, he was appointed manager of the club's reserve team. He returned to Norway in 2011 to manage his former club, Molde, leading them to their first-ever Tippeligaen titles in his [[2011 Tippeligaen|first]] [[2012 Tippeligaen|two]] seasons. He added a third major honour by winning the [[2013 Norwegian Football Cup final|2013 Norwegian Football Cup]]. In 2014, Solskjær took charge of [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], though the club was [[2013–14 Cardiff City F.C. season|relegated]] from the [[Premier League]] during his tenure. In late 2018, he returned to Manchester United as [[caretaker manager]] following the departure of [[José Mourinho]], taking charge for the remainder of the [[2018–19 Manchester United F.C. season|2018–19 season]].<ref name="OGS MU 1" /> 

On 28 March 2019, after winning 14 of his first 19 matches in charge, Solskjær was appointed [[List of Manchester United F.C. managers|manager of Manchester United]] on a permanent basis with a three-year contract.<ref name=":0" /> He led the club to the [[2021 UEFA Europa League final]], where they were defeated by [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] in a penalty shoot-out.

===Manchester United===
====1996–97 season: Debut====
Solskjær joined Manchester United under [[Alex Ferguson]] on 29 July 1996, and was something of a surprise acquisition as he was almost unknown outside his homeland and at the time United were still in the hunt for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[England national football team|England]] striker [[Alan Shearer]], who then joined [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for a world-record £15&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Rich |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2320055/Farewell-to-Ole-Gunnar-Solskjaer.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2320055/Farewell-to-Ole-Gunnar-Solskjaer.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Farewell to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=London |date=29 August 2007 |access-date=29 December 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref> As the only striker to arrive at [[Old Trafford]] that year, it was widely expected that his first season would be spent as a backup to [[Eric Cantona]] and [[Andy Cole]] with only occasional first-team opportunities. However, within weeks of his arrival it was clear that he would be a key part of the first team sooner than had been anticipated, and would also prove himself to be one of the biggest Premier League bargains of the season.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2008-04-28 |title=Man Utd to mark Solskjaer career |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/7372332.stm |access-date=2025-05-17 |language=en-GB}}</ref>

He was issued with the number 20 shirt for the [[1996–97 Manchester United F.C. season|1996–97 season]], a squad number he would retain for the rest of his Manchester United career.

====2002–03 season====
By the [[2002–03 Manchester United F.C. season|2002–03 season]], both Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke had left Old Trafford, leaving Solskjær, [[Diego Forlán]] and Van Nistelrooy to compete for a place in the starting line-up. Ferguson's persistence in playing Van Nistelrooy up front with Paul Scholes, or as a lone striker, meant that opportunities were limited.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Solskjær scored Manchester United's first goal of the season on 17 August 2002, netting the winning goal (his 100th in all competitions) against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in the 78th minute.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.premierleague.com/match/4052 |title=Man Utd v West Brom, 2002/03 |publisher=Premier League |access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2196586.stm |title=Solskjaer saves Man Utd |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 August 2002 |access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref> On 19 October, he earned a point for United in a 1–1 draw against Fulham, equalising in the 61st minute.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.premierleague.com/match/4137 |title=Fulham v Man Utd, 2002/03 |publisher=Premier League |access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref>

Solskjær was subsequently given his time again when David Beckham picked up an injury and Ferguson played the Norwegian on the right wing. While proving himself to be an able crosser of the ball, Solskjær also continued to contribute with goals, scoring a total of 16 goals in the season. He was selected to play on the right in important matches, such as in the league game against Arsenal and the Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid, while Beckham was left on the bench. He also [[Captain (association football)|captained]] the team in a number of matches.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

====2003–06: Injury-plagued seasons====
At the start of [[2003–04 Manchester United F.C. season|2003–04]], Solskjær found himself as United's first-choice right winger. However, a knee injury suffered against [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] on 16 September 2003 put Solskjær out of action until February 2004. Solskjær returned from the injury for the season run-in and was man of the match in the [[2003–04 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-final victory over Arsenal. He also played in the [[2004 FA Cup final]], which the club won. Solskjær was forced to undergo intensive knee surgery in August 2004 and had to miss the [[2004–05 Manchester United F.C. season|2004–05 season]] entirely.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

To show their continuing support, United fans added a banner to the collection that lines the Stretford End reading "'''2<span style="color:Red;">0 LE</span>GEND'''"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/solskjaer_20legend/20legend-banner.jpg|date=26 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626150737/http://www.geocities.com/solskjaer_20legend/20legend-banner.jpg|archive-date=26 June 2008|title=Yahoo &#124; Mail, Weather, Search, Politics, News, Finance, Sports & Videos}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=October 2021}} (Solskjær wore number 20 for United). Solskjær further solidified his status amongst United fans when he became a patron of the supporters action group, [[Manchester United Supporters' Trust]] (MUST), previously Shareholders United.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

====2006–07 season: Back from injury====
Solskjær made his long-awaited return to action on 5 December 2005, playing for United's reserves against Liverpool.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/4485040.stm |title=Buoyant Solskjaer back in action |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 December 2005 |access-date=25 April 2008}}</ref> Spectators numbering 2,738 showed up to witness the comeback of the popular Norwegian – an above-average turn-out for a reserve team match. He made his first-team return as a substitute in the match against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on 28 December. He then finally made his first start in January 2006 in an [[2005–06 FA Cup|FA Cup]] match against [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]], before playing a full game as a captain in the third round replay. His return to full fitness slowly continued with regular appearances in the reserves, until on 8 March 2006 when, during a game against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], he was accidentally caught by [[Ugo Ehiogu]], breaking his cheekbone. While facing the possibility of missing the rest of the season,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/4784578.stm |title=Solskjaer suffers more injury woe |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 March 2006 |access-date=25 April 2008}}</ref> he nevertheless appeared as a substitute against Sunderland on Good Friday. Solskjær had a successful pre-season tour in the summer of 2006 gaining Ferguson's praise who also said he would reconsider his plan to buy a new striker.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/5183620.stm |title=Orlando Pirates 0–4 Man Utd |date=16 July 2006 |access-date=23 April 2008 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

He returned to [[2006–07 FA Premier League|Premier League]] action on 23 August 2006 when he scored in an away match against Charlton Athletic, his first Premier League goal since April 2003. Ferguson commented after the match that "it was a great moment for Ole, United fans everywhere, the players and the staff" and that "Ole has been through a torrid time with injuries for the last two years, but he's persevered and never lost faith and has got his repayment tonight. Everyone is over the moon for him." He continued his come-back by putting in the winning goal in the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at home on 13 September, fulfilling his post-injury ambition to score another goal at Old Trafford. Solskjær's first Premier League goals at Old Trafford since his return came on 1 October when he scored both goals in the 2–0 win against Newcastle United. His goalscoring form continued when he started in the away match against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and struck a sublime finish to round off a 3–1 victory, and again against [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] on 25 October 2006, scoring the first goal in a 2–1 away victory in the third round of the League Cup. After a further injury sustained in [[Copenhagen]] in the UEFA Champions League, Solskjær recovered and again returned to form scoring the third goal in a 3–1 home win over Wigan on Boxing Day. Solskjær continued his form by scoring United's opening goal in their 3–2 home win over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] on 30 December. Additionally, he came on as a substitute to score an injury-time winner in the 2–1 victory over Aston Villa at home in the [[2006–07 FA Cup|FA Cup]] third round on 7 January 2007.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

After scoring in the away FA Cup fifth round replay match against Reading on 27 February, Solskjær had further surgery on his knee. However, it was not as serious as his previous operations, and he was out of action for only a month. He was predicted to be available for the home game against Blackburn Rovers on 31 March. United manager Ferguson said: "It was good timing with the international break coming up. It gave us the opportunity to get the thing done." Solskjær did make his comeback against Blackburn Rovers as a late substitute, and even scored in the 89th minute to seal Manchester United's 4–1 win. His last match was the [[2007 FA Cup final]] against Chelsea, but he had to settle for an FA Cup runners-up medal, as an extra-time goal from [[Didier Drogba]] gave Chelsea the victory.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

On 5 June 2007, it was announced that Solskjær had undergone minor surgery after he reported discomfort in his knee while training with [[Norway national football team|Norway]]. The surgery was a success, but Solskjær failed to fully recover and announced his retirement from professional football on 27 August 2007. On 4 September, at a home game against Sunderland, Solskjær walked onto the pitch to say goodbye to the fans and received a standing ovation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/01/minutebyminute.sport1 |title=Man Utd 1–0 Sunderland |date=4 September 2007 |access-date=9 April 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> As of his retirement, Solskjær held the record for the most goals scored for Manchester United as a substitute, scoring 28 goals off the bench,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stretfordend.co.uk/substitutes/overall.html |title=All substitute appearances in all competitive matches (plus goals as a sub) |website=StretfordEnd.co.uk |access-date=25 April 2008}}</ref> as well as the most Premier League goals as a substitute with 17,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/aug/29/theknowledge.sport |title=The Knowledge: Is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the superest sub ever? |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 August 2007 |first1=Rob |last1=Smyth |first2=Nicky |last2=Bandini |access-date=12 January 2014}}</ref> a mark which has since been passed by [[Jermain Defoe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.premierleague.com/stats/records |title=Premier League Records |publisher=Premier League |access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref>

====Super sub role====

Reflecting on this aspect of his career years later, Solskjær said: "I had to think about myself, how can I do the most damage for the opposition if I come on? I sat there and I studied football games but I didn't exactly analyse their strikers. [...] Instead I would pay attention to what the defenders and full-backs were doing wrong."<ref name=observer>{{cite news |last=Amy |first=Lawrence |title=Old celebration gets new outing as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer sparkles again |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/nov/10/celebration-ole-gunnar-solskjaer-molde |access-date=11 November 2012 |newspaper=The Observer |date=10 November 2012}}</ref>

==International career==
Solskjær made his international debut in a [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly match]] against [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] on 26 November 1995, just a few months before he joined Manchester United. The game finished in a 1–1 draw with Solskjær scoring the only goal for Norway. He continued his great goal scoring start by scoring three goals in his first competitive appearances for the national team during the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 3|1998 World Cup qualifying campaign]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Solskjær played in both the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000]] for Norway. He formed a feared partnership with [[Tore André Flo]] which was seen as one of the best striking partnerships in Norway's history.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Following his lengthy layout to injuries Solskjær made his full game comeback on 2 September 2006, when he scored the first and last goals in a 4–1 win against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in a [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group C|Euro 2008 qualifying]] match. They would be his last goals for the national team taking his tally up to 23 goals.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/history/news/0254-0d7b8cf8b8e0-3d889e7fb53f-1000--solskj%C3%A6r-shines-in-norway-triumph/ |title=Solskjær shines in Norway triumph |publisher=UEFA |date=2 September 2006 |access-date=31 December 2018}}</ref>

==Style of play and reception==
Solskjær was nicknamed "the Baby-faced Assassin" in the British media throughout his career, due to his youthful looks and his clinical finishing.<ref name="miss"/> He also earned a reputation as a "super-sub" in the press due to his penchant for scoring goals after coming off the bench.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Anka |first1=Carl |title=Solskjaer, the former super-sub who doesn't like using his bench |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/2005120/2020/08/21/manchester-united-solskjaer-substitutions-rashford-greenwood-martial/ |access-date=6 March 2024 |work=The Athletic |date=21 August 2020}}</ref> Although he was primarily deployed as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] throughout his career, he was also capable of playing as a [[Midfielder#Wide midfielder|wide midfielder]] on either flank.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mathieson |first1=Stuart |title=Ole's the right man for Becks' job |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/oles-the-right-man-for-becks-job-1148571 |access-date=15 April 2024 |work=Manchester Evening News |date=10 August 2004}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
===First step into coaching===
Solskjær signed his last player contract with Manchester United on 31 March 2006, with a provision to allow him to develop his coaching credentials. He also acted in an ambassadorial role for the club, when he travelled to Hong Kong in 2006 and played with students at the Manchester United Soccer School there. When interviewed by [[Setanta Sports]] in August 2007, Solskjær confirmed he would train to be a coach after retiring from professional football, and would start to earn the required badges after his last season with Manchester United. Following his retirement, Solskjær worked for Ferguson at Old Trafford, coaching the strikers on the first team for the remainder of the [[2007–08 Manchester United F.C. season|2007–08 season]].<ref>{{cite news |first=James |last=Ducker |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/12/29/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-perfect-mentor-marcus-rashford-reaches/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/12/29/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-perfect-mentor-marcus-rashford-reaches/ |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the perfect mentor for Marcus Rashford as he reaches key stage in his development |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=London |date=29 December 2018 |access-date=31 December 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

As announced on 20 May 2008, he took over the [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|Manchester United Reserves]] during that summer. Solskjær was United's first full-time reserve team manager since 2006, taking over from [[Brian McClair]] and [[Jimmy Ryan (footballer, born 1945)|Jimmy Ryan]], who had filled the role in a caretaker capacity.

Under Solskjær, United had a slow start to the [[2020–21 Premier League]] season, starting the campaign with a 3–1 loss to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at home and scoring seven points from their first six league games, placing them 15th in the league table. This included a 6–1 home loss to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in October, United's joint heaviest defeat in the Premier League, that saw Solskjær stating it was the worst day of his managerial career; as well as a 1–0 home loss to Arsenal in November, which was Solskjær's 100th match in charge of United, where Solskjær reacted by saying that United's players "didn't turn up".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/54313274|title=Manchester United 1–6 Tottenham Hotspur|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=4 October 2020|access-date=8 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Stone |first1=Simon |title=Manchester United 0 Arsenal 1 |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/54679344 |access-date=20 December 2021 |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=1 November 2020}}</ref>

Meanwhile, in the [[2020–21 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], United were knocked out in the [[2020–21 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]] when they finished third in their group, with one win and one loss against each of their opponents, Paris Saint-Germain, [[RB Leipzig]] and [[İstanbul Başakşehir]]. This result sent United into the [[2020–21 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]].

Back in the Premier League, after eight wins in 10 Premier League games, United travelled to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 12 January 2021 and won 1–0. This put United at the top of the league table after 17 league games, which was the first occasion this happened since the 2012–13 title-winning season under Sir Alex Ferguson.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stone |first1=Simon |title=Burnley 0 Manchester United 1 |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/54038551 |access-date=21 December 2021 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=12 January 2021}}</ref> ''The Guardian'' commented that United exemplified "unerring determination" in this game, which was "a theme of United's season" so far.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jackson |first1=Jamie |title=Manchester United go clear at top after Paul Pogba volley sees off Burnley |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/12/burnley-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report |access-date=21 December 2021 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 January 2021}}</ref> However, United were soon caught by Manchester City, and with a 2–1 home loss to bottom-of-the-table Sheffield United on 27 January 2021, failed to regain the top spot.

Manchester United finished runners-up in the [[2020–21 Premier League|Premier League]] with 74 points, 12 points behind champions Manchester City, and qualified for the [[2021–22 UEFA Champions League|Champions League group stage]].
