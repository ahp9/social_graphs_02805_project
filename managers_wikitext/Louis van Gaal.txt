'''Aloysius Paulus Maria''' "'''Louis'''" '''van Gaal''' ({{IPA|nl|luˈʋi vɑŋ ˈɣaːl|-|Nl-Louis van Gaal.ogg}};{{efn|''Van'' in isolation is pronounced {{IPA|nl|vɑn|}}.}} born 8 August 1951) is a Dutch former [[association football|football]] player and former manager who currently serves as an advisor for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]. At club level, he served as manager of [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[AZ Alkmaar|AZ]], [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], as well as having three spells in charge of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]].

Before his career as a coach, Van Gaal played as a midfielder for [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], [[Stormvogels Telstar|Telstar]], [[Sparta Rotterdam]], Ajax and AZ. He is also a qualified [[physical education]] teacher, and worked at high schools during his career as a semi-professional footballer.<ref>{{cite book |first=Meindert |last=Van der Kaaij |title=Louis van Gaal |year=1997 |location=Utrecht |publisher=Kwadrat, cop |language=nl |isbn=90-6481-277-2 |page=43 onw}}</ref> After a brief spell as an assistant coach at AZ, Van Gaal served as an assistant under [[Leo Beenhakker]] at Ajax, and eventually took over as head coach in 1991. Under his lead, the club won three [[Eredivisie]] [[List of Dutch football champions|titles]], the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]]. He moved to Barcelona in 1997 and won two [[List of Spanish football champions|league titles]] and one [[Copa del Rey]], but left after disagreements with the club's hierarchy.

Van Gaal was then appointed at the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], but failed to qualify for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. This preceded another brief spell at Barcelona, before he returned to AZ, where he won an Eredivisie title, the club's second ever in its history. He moved to Bayern Munich in 2009, and in Germany won the [[Bundesliga]], the [[DFB-Pokal]] and reached the final of the UEFA Champions League. He returned to manage the Netherlands for a second time, where he led the nation to a third-place finish at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. He was appointed [[List of Manchester United F.C. managers|manager]] of Manchester United later that summer, where he won the [[2015–16 FA Cup|FA Cup]] before he was dismissed only days later. Despite announcing his retirement in 2019, due to family reasons, Van Gaal returned to management in August 2021, when he was appointed as head coach of the Netherlands for a third time.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/04/louis-van-gaal-named-as-netherlands-manager-for-third-time | title = Louis van Gaal named as Netherlands manager for third time | website = The Guardian | date = 4 August 2021 | access-date = 6 August 2021 | archive-date = 2 September 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210902144510/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/04/louis-van-gaal-named-as-netherlands-manager-for-third-time | url-status = live }}</ref> He retired from management after the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]].

==Playing and early coaching career==
Van Gaal was born in [[Amsterdam]].<ref name=BDFutbol/> As a youngster, he started playing for the Amsterdam amateur side RKSV de Meer. At the age of 20, he joined the second team of [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], but was never chosen to play in the first team, which at the time boasted players such as [[Johan Cruyff]] and [[Johan Neeskens]] in the midfield positions. He was loaned to [[Belgian First Division]] side [[Royal Antwerp FC|Royal Antwerp]] playing under [[Guy Thys]] with whom he was runner-up in the Belgian top division in [[1973–74 Belgian First Division|1974]] and [[1974–75 Belgian First Division|1975]]. During his time with Antwerp, Van Gaal suffered a broken nose in a friendly against [[K.V. Kortrijk|Kortrijk]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=de Groote |first1=Raoul |title=Hoe Een Bodybuilder Avant La Lettre Van Gaals Neus Brak (in Dutch) |url=https://staantribune.nl/hoe-een-bodybuilder-avant-la-lettre-van-gaals-neus-brak/ |website=Staantribune |access-date=15 June 2018 |archive-date=15 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615163258/https://staantribune.nl/hoe-een-bodybuilder-avant-la-lettre-van-gaals-neus-brak/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> After four years spent in Belgium, he returned to his homeland and made his [[Eredivisie]] debut for [[Telstar (football club)|Telstar]] under the guidance of manager, [[Mircea Petescu]], whom he followed to [[Sparta Rotterdam]]. He later joined [[AZ Alkmaar|AZ]], where he also became assistant coach in 1986. After a short career at AZ, he returned to Ajax to become [[Leo Beenhakker]]'s assistant. When Beenhakker left in 1991, Van Gaal took over as manager.<ref name="ESPN Soccernet">{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/players/manager?id=99 |title=Louis van Gaal |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |access-date=21 May 2010 |archive-date=21 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521031330/http://www.espnfc.com/players/manager?id=99 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Management career==

===Ajax (1991–1997)===
[[File:Nieuwe trainers Ajax na vertrek Linder Louis van Gaal , kop, Bestanddeelnr 934-3207.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Van Gaal in 1988 as assistant manager with Ajax]]
Van Gaal was Ajax manager from 1991 until 1997 and had a very successful tenure. Under Van Gaal, Ajax became the [[Eredivisie]] champions three times, in [[1993–94 Eredivisie|1994]], [[1994–95 Eredivisie|1995]] (notably going the entire [[1994–95 AFC Ajax season|1994–95]] season unbeaten in both the league and the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]) and [[1995–96 Eredivisie|1996]].<ref name=colour>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-colourful-controversial|title=Louis van Gaal – colourful and controversial but he is a serial winner|date=23 April 2014|access-date=24 April 2014|work=The Guardian|archive-date=4 July 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240704103703/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-colourful-controversial|url-status=live}}</ref> He also led Ajax to the [[KNVB Cup]] in [[1992–93 KNVB Cup|1993]] and the [[Johan Cruyff Shield]] in 1993, 1994, and 1995.

Ajax was so successful under Van Gaal's leadership that during the 1990s, the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]] was dominated by Ajax players such as [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Marc Overmars]], [[Dennis Bergkamp]], [[Frank de Boer|Frank]] and [[Ronald de Boer]], [[Edgar Davids]], [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Winston Bogarde]], [[Michael Reiziger]] and [[Edwin van der Sar]].

After serving out his contract at Ajax in 1997, Van Gaal received his knighthood in the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.louisvangaal.nl/louis-van-gaal.html |title=Over Louis |trans-title=About Louis |publisher=louisvangaal.nl |access-date=21 May 2010 |language=nl |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504082003/http://www.louisvangaal.nl/louis-van-gaal.html |archive-date=4 May 2010 }}</ref>

===Barcelona (1997–2000)===
Van Gaal moved to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 1997, taking over from [[Bobby Robson]], and helped the team win two [[La Liga]] titles ([[1997–98 La Liga|1997–98]], [[1998–99 La Liga|1998–99]]) and the [[1997–98 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]] once.<ref name=colour/> Despite this success, he clashed with the media and came under criticism. He expressed that it was difficult to implement his football philosophy at Barcelona due to cultural differences, and that he struggled hard as some players were unwilling to follow his lead.<ref name="Van Gaal quits Barca">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/holland/756865.stm |title=Van Gaal quits Barca |publisher=BBC |date=20 May 2000 |access-date=21 May 2010 |archive-date=26 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726082509/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/holland/756865.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> His rows with [[Rivaldo]] are an example of this: Van Gaal insisted Rivaldo play as a left winger, whereas Rivaldo argued that he wanted to play in the centre, in effect undermining Van Gaal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/rivaldo-is-dropped-following-row-with-van-gaal-743006.html|title=Rivaldo is dropped following row with Van Gaal|last=Tynan|first=Gordon|date=22 December 1999|work=The Independent|location=London|access-date=21 May 2010|archive-date=11 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311004600/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/rivaldo-is-dropped-following-row-with-van-gaal-743006.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Van Gaal eventually left the Catalan side on 20 May 2000,<ref name="Van Gaal quits Barca"/> days after losing the [[1999–2000 La Liga|league title]] to [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]], uttering the immortal line: "''Amigos de la prensa. Yo me voy. Felicidades''." ("Friends of the press. I am leaving. Congratulations.")<ref name="ESPN Soccernet"/> He returned to the Netherlands to manage the Netherlands national team in preparation for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].

===Netherlands national team (2000–2002)===
Under Van Gaal, the Netherlands started their campaign to qualify for the 2002 World Cup poorly. Placed in [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 2|Group 2]], an injury-hit side could only manage to secure a late 2–2 draw at home to the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], having been 2–0 down with 20 minutes to go.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/23/newsstory.sport11 |title=Joy of Six: Symbolic reducers |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=23 July 2007 |access-date=12 July 2014 |archive-date=3 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203190322/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/23/newsstory.sport11 |url-status=live }}</ref> A 4–0 win over [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] was followed by a 2–0 defeat to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]].

In 2001, the Netherlands beat [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]], [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] and [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], but despite leading group leaders Portugal 2–0 with seven minutes left, drew 2–2 and fell three points behind second-place Republic of Ireland, who were unbeaten. When the sides met in [[Dublin]], Van Gaal boasted before the match that his squad was so much more talented, even the Irish fans would want them to qualify. Ireland went down to ten men after 58 minutes but scored nine minutes later and won 1–0. The Netherlands fell seven points behind them with two games left to play, meaning that they failed to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] for the first time since [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/nov/18/joy-of-six-republic-ireland-football |title=The Joy of Six: Republic of Ireland football moments |work=The Guardian |date=18 November 2011 |access-date=12 July 2014 |archive-date=14 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714220654/http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/nov/18/joy-of-six-republic-ireland-football |url-status=live }}</ref> Van Gaal stepped down as manager on 31 January 2002 to be replaced by [[Dick Advocaat]]. After this, speculation began that Van Gaal would succeed [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] once Ferguson claimed he would retire that year. According to Van Gaal, Ferguson decided against retiring and the deal fell through.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jan/23/newsstory.sport4 |title=Man U close in on Van Gaal |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=23 January 2002 |access-date=22 June 2010 |archive-date=4 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240704103704/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jan/23/newsstory.sport4 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Return to Barcelona (2002–2004)===
Van Gaal returned to Barcelona for the start of the [[2002–03 FC Barcelona season|2002–03 season]] on a contract until June 2005, but results were inconsistent. The club won a record-equalling ten successive matches in [[2002–03 UEFA Champions League|the Champions League]] but struggled in [[2002–03 La Liga|La Liga]]. After four wins, four draws and three defeats from their opening 11 league matches, Barcelona lost three matches in a row, to [[Real Sociedad]], relegation-threatened [[Rayo Vallecano]] and [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]]. Two wins and a draw improved things but after successive defeats to [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] and [[Celta de Vigo|Celta Vigo]], he left by mutual consent on 28 January 2003 with the club in 12th place, just three points above the relegation zone and 20 points behind leaders Real Sociedad.<ref name="ESPN Soccernet"/>

His transfers, particularly the signings of goalkeeper [[Robert Enke]], midfielder [[Gaizka Mendieta]] and playmaker [[Juan Román Riquelme]], all disappointed.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/2700353.stm |title=Van Gaal leaves Barca |publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 January 2003 |access-date=10 May 2010 |archive-date=17 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191017200140/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/2700353.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> Riquelme had been bought to replace Rivaldo, whom Van Gaal had released on a free transfer, despite having a year left on his contract. The two had fallen out during Van Gaal's previous tenure and after Van Gaal returned, Rivaldo said: "Van Gaal is the main cause of my departure. I don't like Van Gaal, and I am sure that he doesn't like me, either."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/24/sports/24iht-soccer_ed3__7.html |title=Soccer: This time Rivaldo loses the ego war |work=New York Times |date=24 July 2002 |access-date=12 July 2014 |archive-date=14 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714181427/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/24/sports/24iht-soccer_ed3__7.html |url-status=live }}{{registration required}}</ref> Van Gaal replied that Rivaldo's lack of commitment was the reason he was released, saying that he "was only interested in making more money and playing less.

Van Gaal initially announced he would leave AZ at the end of the [[2007–08 Eredivisie|2007–08 season]] due to disappointing results, with the club finishing 11th in the Eredivisie.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ruizenaar |first=Theo |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldFootballNews/idUKL2889958720080328 |title=Van Gaal to step down as AZ Alkmaar coach |work=Reuters |date=28 March 2008 |access-date=9 January 2010 |archive-date=27 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027042105/https://uk.reuters.com/article/worldFootballNews/idUKL2889958720080328 |url-status=dead }}</ref> When several players of the AZ squad said that they would like him to stay with AZ, however, Van Gaal said he would give the players a chance to prove themselves.

Van Gaal got off to a poor start as Bayern coach, winning only one of his first four matches in charge, and by November the club was on the brink of a [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]] exit following two losses to [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]. With [[Bayer Leverkusen]] at the top of the Bundesliga, speculation was rampant that he was on the brink of a departure from Bayern even earlier than his predecessor [[Jürgen Klinsmann]]. Van Gaal, however, kept insisting he is a "''prozesstrainer''", meaning that his team needs time to play the way he imagines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/fc-bayern-muenchen-ferguson-capello-1.31952|title=FC Bayern München, "Ferguson?

[[File:Philipp Lahm Louis van Gaal crop.jpg|thumb|left|Van Gaal with [[Philipp Lahm]] in 2009]]
Van Gaal installed many youth players as fixtures in the starting 11, including [[Thomas Müller]] and [[Holger Badstuber]], and also converted the winger [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] into a defensive midfielder. A feud with Italian striker [[Luca Toni]], who had played an important role in Bayern's [[2007–08 FC Bayern Munich season|2007–08]] [[2007–08 Bundesliga|league]] and [[2007–08 DFB-Pokal|cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]], led to Toni's move to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. Bayern Munich's form, however, improved with two Champions League victories including an impressive 4–1 victory over [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] in [[Turin]], which allowed them to progress from their group in second position behind Bordeaux. By March, Bayern had moved to the semi-finals of the [[2009–10 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] and were top of the [[2009–10 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]], ahead of [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]].

Ahead of the last game in the group, Van Gaal accused [[FIFA]] of "playing tricks" in the scheduling of matches to advantage the home nation, as [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] were to play their last group match four hours after the Dutch, who they could meet in the round of 16 depending on their result. Brazil manager [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] reacted by saying: "It was FIFA who chose the kick-off time. Some people expressed a view that we were going to choose who we were going to play. Those sorts of comments are either stupid or ill-intentioned." Van Gaal also criticised the referees who had awarded penalties against the Dutch in both of their matches, calling the decisions "unjustified" and "incorrect".<ref>{{cite news|title=World Cup 2014: Fifa unfair over fixtures – Louis van Gaal|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27970924|access-date=23 June 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=23 June 2014|archive-date=23 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623111932/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27970924|url-status=live}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[FIFA]]'' in January 2008, Van Gaal spoke of the importance of his football philosophy rather than the systems he used, as well as the need for flexibility as a coach, as demonstrated by his use of several formations throughout his career, such as the 4–3–3 and 3–3–1–3/3–4–3  with Ajax, the 2–3–2–3 at Barcelona, the 4–4–2 at AZ Alkmaar, and the 4–2–3–1 with Bayern Munich.

At Ajax, Van Gaal's style of using set patterns of play was inspired by Dutch ''[[Total Football|total football]]'', which was popularised by fellow former Ajax manager [[Rinus Michels]]; his players were therefore known for their quick passing as well as their versatility.<ref name="When Ajax ruled the world"/> He brought in experts from different sports as part of his coaching staff to improve the players' athletic qualities through rigorous training, including physiologist Jos Geysel, running coach and ex-basketball player Laszlo Jambor, and the club's strength and conditioning coach Rene Wormhoudt.<ref name="When Ajax ruled the world"/> Van Gaal also used Van der Sar as a [[sweeper keeper]], who would not only rush out of his area to clear the ball away from danger, but also build-up plays from the back with his passing and ability with his feet; his defenders, in particular the [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]] in the [[centre-back|centre]] of the back–three, were also required to be comfortable controlling and distributing the ball out from the back.<ref name="When Ajax ruled the world"/><ref name="original">{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/82112/buffon-%E2%80%98neuer-not-original%E2%80%99|title=Buffon: 'Neuer not original'|publisher=Football Italia|date=31 March 2016|access-date=7 April 2016|archive-date=2 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210202072922/https://www.football-italia.net/82112/buffon-%E2%80%98neuer-not-original%E2%80%99|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/8916701/Liverpool-goalkeeper-Pepe-Reina-believes-club-are-on-the-right-road-to-fulfilling-their-Europe-dream.html|title=Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina believes club are on the right road to fulfilling their Europe dream|publisher=The Telegraph|first=Duncan|last=White|date=26 November 2011|access-date=15 April 2016|archive-date=27 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427050420/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/8916701/Liverpool-goalkeeper-Pepe-Reina-believes-club-are-on-the-right-road-to-fulfilling-their-Europe-dream.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="mani del gigante">{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1999/05/28/juve-nelle-mani-del-gigante.html|title=Juve nelle mani del gigante|publisher=La Repubblica|language=it|first=Emanuele|last=Gamba|date=28 May 1999|access-date=24 October 2017|archive-date=9 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909005210/http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1999/05/28/juve-nelle-mani-del-gigante.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The team were not only known for their technical ability, tactical sense, and exciting playing style, but for their athletic and physical qualities as well.<ref name="When Ajax ruled the world"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2068516-louis-van-gaal-new-manchester-united-manager-fans-react |title=Louis Van Gaal: New Manchester United Manager, Fans React |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=19 May 2014 |access-date=2 May 2024 |archive-date=2 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240502182523/https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2068516-louis-van-gaal-new-manchester-united-manager-fans-react |url-status=live }}</ref> Defensively, Van Gaal also made use of a high defensive line and pressing off the ball when not in possession.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/the-van-gaal-dossier/index.html |title=The Van Gaal Dossier |work=Telegraph.co.uk |last1=Liew |first1=Jonathan |date=15 August 2014 |access-date=5 May 2024 |archive-date=5 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240505191043/https://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/the-van-gaal-dossier/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/louis-van-gaal-out-manchester-united-1.3596404 |title=Manchester United fire Louis van Gaal |work=CBC Sports |date=23 May 2016 |access-date=5 May 2024 |archive-date=5 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240505191019/https://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/louis-van-gaal-out-manchester-united-1.3596404 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Despite his achievements, Cruyff was often critical of what he perceived as being Van Gaal's more rigid coaching style, in comparison to his own more intuitive approach, commenting: "Van Gaal has a good vision on football. But it's not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I don't. I want individuals to think for themselves and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation... I don't have anything against computers, but you judge football players intuitively and with your heart. On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax [recommended by Van Gaal] I would have failed the test. When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. Besides, I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you cannot measure with a computer."<ref>Meijer, Maarten (2014). ''Louis van Gaal: The Biography''.

==Personal life==
The youngest of nine brothers and sisters, Van Gaal was brought up as a Catholic. His father, a salesman, died when Van Gaal was 11. At the age of 18, Van Gaal met Fernanda Obbes at a Catholic youth group. They married three years later, and had two daughters, Brenda and Renate.
