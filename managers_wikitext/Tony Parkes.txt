'''Anthony Parkes''' (born 5 May 1949) is an English former professional [[association football|footballer]]. After retiring, he became a coach. He was most recently [[caretaker manager]] at [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]. It was the seventh such role of his coaching career, having performed the role on six occasions for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. As of 2011 he worked as a [[Scout (sport)|scout]] for Blackburn Rovers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/blackburn-icon-parkes-returns-scout-1045561|title = Blackburn icon Parkes returns as scout – Tribal Football}}</ref>{{Update inline|date=March 2019}}

==Playing career==
Parkes was a [[midfielder]] who started his career in [[non-League football]] at [[Buxton F.C.|Buxton]] in 1969 before moving to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in 1970 where he spent the rest of his playing career. He played a total of 350 league games and scored 38 goals for Rovers before retiring in 1982.

==Coaching career==
After retiring as a player, Parkes stayed with Blackburn, joining their coaching staff under [[Bobby Saxton]], where he became assistant manager. He stood in as [[caretaker manager]] for the club six times between 1986 and 2004. He took over from Bobby Saxton (December 1986 – February 1987), [[Don Mackay]] (September–October 1991), [[Ray Harford]] (October 1996 – June 1997), [[Roy Hodgson]] (November–December 1998), [[Brian Kidd]] (November 1999 – March 2000) and [[Graeme Souness]] (September 2004)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/managers/manager.sd?manager_id=1248|title=Tony Parkes &#124; Latest Betting Odds &#124; Soccer Base}}</ref> after their departures.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/22/joe-kinnear-david-pleat-tony-parkes | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=John | last1=Ashdown | first2=Rob | last2=Smyth | title=The longest caretaker-manager stint | date=22 October 2008}}</ref>

During this time Rovers experienced something of a revolution. During his first caretaker spell, they were a struggling [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] club who had not tasted top flight football for some 20 years. Five years later, during his second caretaker spell, they had just been taken over by local steel baron [[Jack Walker]] and were a wealthy, ambitious side building for a challenge for promotion to the new [[FA Premier League]] – which was ultimately achieved at the end of the season under new manager [[Kenny Dalglish]]. By the time of his third caretaker spell five years later, barely 18 months had passed since their Premier League title triumph – the club's first top division title since 1914 – although their form had slumped and they did not win a league game until November. He took charge until the end of the season and kept Rovers up. His fourth spell came in November 1999, six months after relegation from the Premier League and with Rovers 19th in Division One. while Parkes hoped to secure promotion and the manager's position on a full-time basis, this time taking charge for four months until [[Graeme Souness]] was appointed as manager, retaining Parkes as his assistant. When Souness moved on early in the 2004–05 season, Parkes took temporary charge again until [[Mark Hughes]] was appointed as manager.

He left Rovers in November 2004, after 34 years at the club, when Hughes disposed of his services in order to select his own coaching staff. Parkes criticised the club after he learned of his sacking from his daughter, who had heard the news on the radio, saying, "Usually Blackburn do it the right way, but they got it wrong. I think I deserve a bit more respect than to have my daughter telling me she's just heard it on the radio."<ref name="bbc4006073">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/blackburn_rovers/4006073.stm|title=Second-hand sacking angers Parkes|date=12 November 2004|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=17 February 2009}}</ref> Parkes was given a [[testimonial match]] in May 2005, a game which attracted back many former Rovers' favourites such as [[Alan Shearer]] and [[Colin Hendry]].

Parkes became Blackpool's assistant manager in December 2005, shortly after [[Simon Grayson]] was appointed as caretaker manager, and he helped the club win promotion to the [[Football League Championship]] in the 2006–07 season after a successful play-off final against [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]]. On 4 March 2008, he signed a new contract, keeping him at [[Bloomfield Road]] until 2010.<ref name="BBC7277304">{{cite news  | title = Parkes extends Blackpool contract | publisher = [[BBC Sport]] | date = 4 March 2008 | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/blackpool/7277304.stm | access-date = 4 March 2008 }}</ref><ref name="BFC1256285">{{cite news | title = Coaching Duo Sign New Deals | publisher = [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] | date = 4 March 2008 | url = http://www.blackpoolfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10432~1256285,00.html  | accessdate = 4 March 2008 }}</ref>

In December 2008, Parkes was installed as a caretaker manager for the seventh time in his career, after Grayson resigned from his position as Blackpool manager to join [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. Blackpool's first-team coach, [[Steve Thompson (footballer born 1964)|Steve Thompson]], was promoted to the role of assistant manager. After his first game in charge, a 1–1 [[Boxing Day]] draw against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] at [[Hillsborough (stadium)|Hillsborough]], Parkes revealed that the Blackpool board was willing to give him the job full-time, with Thompson continuing as his assistant, if the team continued to perform as they did under Grayson.<ref name="bbc7787668">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/7787668.stm|title=Sheff Wed 1–1 Blackpool|date=26 December 2008|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=26 December 2008}}</ref> Blackpool finished the [[Blackpool F.C. season 2008-09|2008–09]] season in 16th place in The Championship.

"I felt the offer was unjust and there was no way that I could accept it. I don't want to cause a scene or a major problem, because I don't want to go down that road of people saying I'm bitter and twisted. We had some terrific results and some great days and they will stick with me for the rest of my life. I can't understand why I had that kind of offer after what I'd done. That will be the thing that will always concern me."<ref name=Gillatt>{{cite book|last=Gillatt|first=Peter|title=Blackpool FC On This Day: History, Facts and Figures from Every Day of the Year |publisher=Pitch Publishing Ltd|date=30 November 2009|isbn=978-1-905411-50-4}}</ref>
