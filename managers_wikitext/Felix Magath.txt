'''Wolfgang Felix Magath''' ({{IPA|de|maɡat}}; born 26 July 1953) is a German [[Association football|football]] manager and former player.

The most notable spell of his playing career was with [[Hamburger SV]], with whom he won three [[Bundesliga]] titles, the [[1977 European Cup Winners' Cup Final]] and the [[1983 European Cup Final]], scoring in both finals. He also gained 43 international [[Cap (association football)|caps]] for the [[Germany national football team|West Germany national team]], winning [[UEFA Euro 1980]] and reaching two consecutive [[List of FIFA World Cup finals|World Cup finals]].

As a manager, Magath's honours include two consecutive [[Double (association football)|Doubles]] ([[Bundesliga]] and [[DFB-Pokal|German Cup]] titles) with [[Bayern Munich]], and a further Bundesliga title with [[VfL Wolfsburg]] in 2009. He has a reputation of demanding strong discipline and thorough training.

In 2014, Magath coached English club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], becoming the first German to manage in the [[Premier League]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/20/felix-magath-fulham-target-avoid-relegation|title=Felix Magath sets struggling Fulham a six-win target to avoid relegation|date=21 February 2014| website = The Guardian | access-date = 6 October 2015}}</ref>

==Playing career==
Born near [[Aschaffenburg]],<ref name=BDFutbol/> Magath started his career playing for local club [[Viktoria Aschaffenburg]]. From 1974 to 1976, he played for [[1. FC Saarbrücken]], at that time in the [[2. Bundesliga|second division]], before moving to [[Hamburger SV]] in the [[Bundesliga|top flight]]. He spent the following ten seasons with Hamburg, and from his debut in 1976 to his retirement he scored 46 goals in 306 games in the West German top flight.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.rsssf.org/players/magathdata.html | title = Felix Magath – Matches and Goals in Bundesliga | first = Matthias | last = Arnhold | date = 1 October 2015 | access-date = 16 October 2015 | publisher = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation}}</ref>

In [[1982–83 European Cup|1983]], Magath led Hamburg to success in the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], scoring the single goal in [[1983 European Cup Final|the final]] against [[Juventus FC|Juventus]];<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.11freunde.de/artikel/europapokal-1983-hsv-juventus-10 | title = Ein Abend in Athen | language = de | publisher = 11Freunde.de | date = 7 February 2011 | access-date = 3 May 2014}}</ref> in [[1980–81 Bundesliga|1980–81]], he netted a career-best (in the first division) ten goals, helping his side to a runner-up league spot, as Hamburg also won the league in three years during that time.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/spieler/magathfelix/ | title = Felix Magath | language = de | publisher = fussballdaten.de | access-date = 3 May 2014}}</ref>

Magath also represented the [[Germany national football team|West Germany national team]] at many international events, including the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s, helping West Germany finish in second place both times.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/statisticsandrecords/players/player=174724/index.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080620010509/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/statisticsandrecords/players/player=174724/index.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 20 June 2008 | title = Felix MAGATH | publisher = FIFA| access-date = 3 May 2014}}</ref> He was also part of the squad that won the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 UEFA European Championship]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/match/3574--west-germany-vs-netherlands/ | title = Allofs hat-trick sees off Dutch | publisher = UEFA| date = 4 October 2003 | access-date = 3 May 2014 }}</ref> Magath made his debut on 30 April 1977, in a 2–1 friendly win with [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], and went on to amass 43 [[Cap (sport)|caps]], with three goals.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.rsssf.org/miscellaneous/magath-intl.html | title = Felix Wolfgang Magath – International Appearances | first = Matthias | last = Arnhold | date = 1 October 2015 | access-date = 16 October 2015 | publisher = Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation}}</ref>

==Style of play==
A talented, creative, and intelligent diminutive [[playmaker]], with an eye for goal, Magath normally played either as an [[Attacking midfielder|attacking]] or [[central midfielder]], and was an elegant player on the ball, who possessed excellent technical skills, vision, and stamina, despite his lack of significant pace and his stocky physique. He was also a strong passer and striker of the ball with his left foot,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/felix-magath-torn-between-hamburg-past-and-hertha-berlin-present-play-off-19982 |title=Felix Magath: a man torn between Hamburg past and Hertha Berlin present |publisher=bundesliga.com |access-date=25 September 2023 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/coppa_campioni/coppa_campioni_82_83.html|title=Coppa dei Campioni 1982/83: Amburgo|trans-title=1982/83 European Cup: Hamburg|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=it|access-date=25 May 2016|archive-date=2 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602015510/http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/coppa_campioni/coppa_campioni_82_83.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/felix-magath_%28Enciclopedia-dello-Sport%29/ |title=MAGATH, Felix in "Enciclopedia dello Sport" |publisher=www.treccani.it |language=it-IT |access-date=25 September 2023 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/01bd-0ea89b7da8e5-ef57788d98f7-1000--magath-out-hitzfeld-in-at-bayern/ |title=Magath out, Hitzfeld in at Bayern |publisher=[[UEFA]] |date=31 January 2007 |access-date=25 September 2023 }}</ref> and stood out for his work-rate on the pitch, as well as his ability to interpret the game.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-germany-hsv-stars-factbox-idUKKCN1ID0MJ |title=Factbox - Hamburg SV's greatest players |work=Reuters |date=12 May 2018 |access-date=25 September 2023 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/best-number-10s-robben-netzer-matthaus-24578 |title=60 years of the Bundesliga: The best number 10s |publisher=bundesliga.com |access-date=25 September 2023 }}</ref> Considered to be a decisive player,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/can-felix-magath-save-hertha-berlin-from-relegation-19236 |title=Felix Magath: Can the seasoned taskmaster save Hertha Berlin from relegation? |publisher=bundesliga.com |access-date=25 September 2023 }}</ref> he is rated by pundits as one of the greatest midfielders in the history of the Bundesliga.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1781626-20-greatest-bundesliga-midfielders-of-all-time |title=20 Greatest Bundesliga Midfielders of All Time |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=Whitney |first1=Clark |date=23 September 2013 |access-date=25 September 2023 }}</ref>

==Managerial career==
===1986–1992: General manager===
Having suffered a career-ending knee injury, Magath retired shortly after the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] and became [[Director of football|general manager]] for his former club Hamburg. He left Hamburg in June 1988 after moderate success. His next stints as general manager included then [[2. Bundesliga]], side [[1. FC Saarbrücken]] (November 1989 to June 1990), as well as [[KFC Uerdingen 05|Bayer Uerdingen]] (July 1990 to January 1992), who were relegated from the first tier during Magath's time at the club.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.focus.de/sport/mehrsport/fussball-steckbrief-die-karriere-von-felix-magath_aid_606878.html | title = Steckbrief: Die Karriere von Felix Magath | language = de | publisher = Focus | date = 9 March 2011 | access-date = 4 May 2014 | first = Jörg | last = Schiffmann| work = FOCUS Online }}</ref>

===2001–2007: Head coach at Stuttgart and Bayern===
[[file:Antwerpes-Magath.jpg|thumb|Magath being interviewed as the coach of [[VfB Stuttgart]]]]
Magath bounced back with what was to become one of his most successful stints when he took over fellow relegation battlers [[VfB Stuttgart]] a few weeks after. Having narrowly avoided relegation in 2001, Stuttgart finished the [[2001–02 Bundesliga|2001–02]] in a mid-table position. The club went then on to become [[2002–03 Bundesliga]] runners-up and finished the [[2003–04 Bundesliga|2003–04 season]] as respectable fourth. During this time, Magath also introduced a group of players from the Stuttgart youth ranks, such as [[Timo Hildebrand]], [[Andreas Hinkel]] and [[Kevin Kurányi]], who became known as ''"die jungen Wilden"'' (wild youth).<ref name="suite101.de" /> The Stuttgart stint was also the first time Magath combined the head coach and the [[director of football]] roles.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.goal.com/de/news/3642/editorial/2012/07/19/3250515/felix-magath-auf-einkaufstour-diese-transferknaller-zahlten-sich- | title = Felix Magath auf Einkaufstour: Diese Transferknaller zahlten sich sportlich und finanziell aus | language = de | work = Goal (website) | date = 19 July 2012 | access-date = 4 May 2014}}</ref> He finished with a record of 73 wins, 37 draws, and 37 losses.<ref name="VfB Stuttgart - Trainerhistorie">{{cite web|title=VfB Stuttgart|url=https://www.kicker.de/vfb-stuttgart/team-trainer/bundesliga/2013-14|publisher=kicker|access-date=16 January 2014|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228194253/http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/vereine/1-bundesliga/2013-14/vfb-stuttgart-11/trainer.html|archive-date=28 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>
