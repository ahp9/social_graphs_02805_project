==Club career==
===Newell's Old Boys===

He was quickly placed in a team attending a tournament in [[Mar del Plata]] in January 1987, and helped the team win 3–2 in the final against [[Club Olimpia]] of [[Paraguay]], after which he signed for Newell's.{{sfn|Balague|2017|p=11}} He was offered a professional contract at 16, and made his first appearance in the [[1988–89 Argentine Primera División|Primera División]] in the [[1988–89 Argentine Primera División|1988–89 season]] when he was 17.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.firsttouchonline.com/the-mauricio-pochettino-story/ |title=The Mauricio Pochettino Story |work=FirstTouchonline.com |access-date=22 January 2020 |archive-date=1 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901182051/https://www.firsttouchonline.com/the-mauricio-pochettino-story/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

He stayed six-and-a-half years at the club. Although he had the opportunity to move on a number of occasions, he chose to stay. In 1998, he stayed so as to reconnect with his former coach Bielsa, and he also rejected an offer from [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] in the [[1999–2000 La Liga|1999–2000 season]] out of loyalty to the club.{{sfn|Balague|2017|p=17}} In that season, he helped Espanyol beat [[Atlético Madrid]] in the [[2000 Copa del Rey final|2000 final]] of the [[Copa del Rey]], winning their first major trophy in 60 years.<ref name=CopadelRey>{{cite news |first=Ignacio |last=Tylko |title=El Espanyol festeja su centenario con la conquista de la Copa |url=https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/deportes/2000/05/27/espanyol-festeja-centenario-conquista-copa/0003_49356.htm |newspaper=La Voz de Galicia |date=27 May 2000 |access-date=26 November 2019 |language=es |archive-date=3 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210103055431/https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/deportes/2000/05/27/espanyol-festeja-centenario-conquista-copa/0003_49356.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rsssf.org/tabless/spancup00.html |title=Spain Cups 1999/2000 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |first1=Carles |last1=Lozano Ferrer |first2=José Luis |last2=Molinera Mesa |date=3 February 2004|access-date=25 May 2018}}</ref>

In the 1999–2000 season, he signed a pre-agreement to stay at the club for six more years, contingent on funding. However, the club could not finance the deal, and informed Pochettino that he should accept an offer from [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]].{{sfn|Balague|2017|pp=18–19}}

Following those two defeats, Pochettino entered the [[2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2025 Gold Cup]] with a relatively inexperienced squad that summer. Many of the usual starters were unavailable due to commitments at the [[2025 FIFA Club World Cup|2025 Club World Cup]], injuries, or fatigue.<ref>{{cite web |title=USMNT confirm final 2025 Gold Cup roster: Tolkin in, Steffen, Dest, Balogun out |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/soccer/news/usmnt-announce-roster-ahead-of-2025-gold-cup-big-names-missing-as-pochettino-shakes-things-up |website=NBC Sports |date=9 June 2025}}</ref> Despite this, the team secured three straight victories against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]], and [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]], topping their group with a perfect record.<ref>{{cite web |title=USA Completes Perfect Gold Cup Group Stage, Will Play Costa Rica In Quarterfinals |url=https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/usmnt-tops-haiti-cap-perfect-gold-cup-group-stage |website=www.foxsports.com}}</ref> Pochettino was lauded for bringing the best out of longtime USMNT players like [[Chris Richards (soccer)|Chris Richards]] and [[Malik Tillman]] as well as integrating new talents [[Diego Luna (soccer, born 2003)|Diego Luna]], [[Alex Freeman]], and [[Patrick Agyemang (soccer, born 2000)|Patrick Agyemang]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tenorio |first1=Paul |title=Stakes rise for USMNT’s World Cup hopefuls after navigating Gold Cup group stage |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6444571/2025/06/23/usmnt-concacaf-gold-cup-group-stage-costa-rica/ |website=The New York Times |date=23 June 2025}}</ref> In the quarterfinals, the U.S. played a thrilling 2–2 match against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] in which Malik Tillman missed a penalty and [[Francisco Calvo]] converted one in regulation time.

==Style of coaching==
Pochettino favours a very high-pressing, attacking style of football. He often employs a [[Formation (association football)#4–2–3–1|4–2–3–1 formation]] at the clubs he manages. While doing so, he instructs his team to build from the back, intimidate and unsettle opponents with a quick-press system and work the ball into the box.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/5-ways-pochettino-can-take-spurs-next-level |title=5 ways Pochettino can take Spurs to the next level |website=FourFourTwo |first=John |last=Robertson |date=23 May 2016 |access-date=23 November 2018 |archive-date=3 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230403211257/https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/5-ways-pochettino-can-take-spurs-next-level |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Pochettino is married to Karina Grippaldi. They have two sons, [[Sebastiano Pochettino|Sebastiano]] and [[Maurizio Pochettino|Maurizio]].

Pochettino believes in "energía universal" (''universal energy''), the idea that people, places and things are charged with a hidden energy, positive or negative. "I believe in energía universal", he said. "It is connected. Nothing happens for causality. It is always a consequence [of something else]. Maybe, it is one of the reasons that Harry [Kane] always scores in derbies. I believe in that energy. For me, it exists".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/apr/29/energia-universal-mauricio-pochetinno-tottenham-revolution |title=Energía universal: how Pochettino has driven the Tottenham revolution |newspaper=The Guardian |first=David |last=Hytner |date=29 April 2017 |access-date=29 December 2018 |archive-date=5 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201105131928/https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/apr/29/energia-universal-mauricio-pochetinno-tottenham-revolution |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/tottenham-hotspur-squad-playing-as-much-for-mauricio-pochettinos-future-as-title-challenge-jj692hmp3 |title=Could Tottenham's title surge persuade Mauricio Pochettino to stay? |newspaper=The Sunday Times |first=James |last=Gheerbrant |date=28 December 2018 |access-date=29 December 2018 |archive-date=28 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228212502/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tottenham-hotspur-squad-playing-as-much-for-mauricio-pochettinos-future-as-title-challenge-jj692hmp3 |url-status=live }}</ref>
