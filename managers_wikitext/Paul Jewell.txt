'''Paul Jewell''' (born 28 September 1964)<ref name="hugman">{{Hugman | 10172 | Paul Jewell | access-date = 26 November 2017}}</ref> is an English football [[Manager (association football)|manager]] and former [[Association football|player]], who was most recently director of football at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]].
 
Jewell began his playing career with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], continued at [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and concluded in a ten-year spell with [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] reserves, apart from a short loan spell with [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]. When his playing career ended, he became part of the coaching staff at Bradford City.

Jewell was appointed manager in 1998 and took City to the [[Premier League]] before resigning and becoming manager of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. He returned to Wigan Athletic to win a second promotion to the Premier League, but resigned a day after he kept them up in the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] season. He later joined [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 28 November 2007, before resigning 13 months later.

He was appointed manager of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in January 2011, but departed following an unsuccessful reign in October 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20048196|title=Paul Jewell leaves as Ipswich Town manager|date=24 October 2012|access-date=24 October 2012|work=BBC Sport}}</ref> He briefly took up assistant coaching roles at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] in 2015 and [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in 2017 before being appointed as director of football at Swindon Town in December 2018. Jewell left Swindon in July 2021.

==Playing career==
Born in [[Liverpool]], [[Lancashire]] (now [[Merseyside]]),<ref name="hugman"/> and educated at [[De La Salle Academy, Liverpool|De La Salle School]], Jewell began his career as an apprentice with home-city club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].

In December 1984, Jewell moved to [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] for £15,000. He made his league debut for Wigan against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] in a 3–3 draw. He appeared 137 times for Wigan, scoring 35 goals, before moving to [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] in an £80,000 deal.<ref name="markham">{{cite book | last = Markham | first = David | title = The legends of Bradford City | publisher = Breedon Books Sport | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-85983-572-2 | page = 99}}</ref> [[Terry Dolan (footballer)|Terry Dolan]] brought Jewell to [[Valley Parade]] in June 1988 as part of a re-building exercise after the club failed to win promotion to [[Football League First Division|Division One]] in [[1987–88 in English football|1987–88]] and had lost [[Stuart McCall]] and [[John Hendrie (Scottish footballer)|John Hendrie]] to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], respectively. He spent a decade as a player at City scoring 56 league goals in 269 appearances, and forged a successful partnership with [[Sean McCarthy (Welsh footballer)|Sean McCarthy]] for four of those seasons. Jewell's most successful spell occurred in [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93]] when he scored 16 league goals to McCarthy's 17 in the first season of new player-manager [[Frank Stapleton]]'s tenure.

Jewell had a brief loan spell at [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] before returning to Bradford. He retired as a player in [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]] when Bradford won promotion from [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] in [[1995–96 in English football|1995–96]] under manager [[Chris Kamara]].

==Managerial career==
===Bradford City===
Jewell started his coaching career long before he retired as a player, joining City's coaching staff during the successful 1995–96 campaign.<ref name="markham"/> The following season City came 21st in [[Football League First Division|Division One]], avoiding relegation with a 3–0 victory on the final day of the season against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. A year later, with 13 points from a possible 15, City were top after five games. However, performances declined from there, and chairman [[Geoffrey Richmond]] sacked Kamara on 6 January 1998, three days after a 2–0 [[FA Cup]] defeat to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].

Richmond turned to Jewell, already Kamara's assistant manager, who then won his first game 2–1 to [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. In his 21 games in charge, Jewell won six games and drew five to guide City to 13th, their highest position since Jewell had joined the club. He was rewarded with a permanent contract when others expected Richmond to recruit a higher-profile replacement.<ref name="markham"/> Richmond wanted to make a promotion challenge, so Jewell broke the club's transfer record twice within the first week of the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99]] season, first with the £1m acquisition of [[Lee Mills]] and then the £1.3m purchase of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] youngster [[Isaiah Rankin]]. He also brought back [[Stuart McCall]] from [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. After a poor start, when City won just one of its first seven games, they picked up momentum and were second behind [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] for most of the latter half of the season. Jewell added [[Lee Sharpe]] on loan and a third £1m signing, [[Dean Windass]], as City held off [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] to finish second. With promotion to the [[Premier League]], Bradford had returned to top-flight football after an absence of 77 years.

Bradford struggled in the Premiership during the [[1999-2000 in English football|1999–2000]] season, but their survival was secured on the last day when, against expectations, they beat Liverpool 1–0 at home, a defeat that cost their opponents a [[UEFA Champions League]] place. Jewell handed in his notice after Richmond called City's 17th-placed Premiership finish "a disappointment". Richmond refused to accept Jewell's resignation. He contended that Jewell had already lined up a job at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] whilst still contracted to City, and placed Jewell on [[Garden leave|gardening leave]]. However, Wednesday worked out a compensation package with City, and Jewell was installed as the new manager of the relegated club.<ref name="leavingbcfc">{{cite book | first1=David |last1=Markham | first2=Lindsay |last2=Sutton | title=The Bradford City Story: The Pain & the Glory | publisher =Breedon Book Publishing Company | date=3 February 2006 | isbn=1-85983-499-X}}</ref>

===Sheffield Wednesday===
Jewell had been hoping to mount a [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] challenge in [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01]] with Wednesday but after enduring a torrid eight months in charge was sacked in February 2001 with the debt-ridden [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] club struggling near the foot of Division One. His highlight was the 2–1 [[League Cup]] victory over local rivals [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and victory over [[Premier League]] club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref>{{cite news

===Wigan Athletic===
In June 2001, Jewell made his return to management with ambitious Division Two club [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. In his second season as manager ([[2002–03 in English football|2002–03]]) the club won the [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] championship and entered the upper half of the English professional football league system for the first time ever. They were near the top of Division One throughout the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]] season but were pipped to a [[playoff]] place on the final day of the season by [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]—who went on to win the playoffs.

On the final day of the [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]] [[Football League Championship|Championship]] season, Jewell's Athletic side clinched promotion to the [[Premier League]] bringing top-flight football to the [[Lancashire]] town for the first time. For the [[2005–06 FA Premier League|2005–06]] season, Jewell's side lost their first game at home to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] via a last-minute winner from [[Hernán Crespo]] but won their first match two games later at home to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. They contested the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] final against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 26 February 2006 but went down 4–0.

On 11 February 2007 during the aftermath of Wigan's defeat at the hands of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], Jewell accused referee [[Phil Dowd]] of failing to award Wigan a penalty and for allowing what appeared to be an offside goal. After the game Jewell was charged by the [[The Football Association|FA]] for improper conduct regarding his verbally insulting the referee. For this offence Jewell was fined [[Pound sterling|£]]2,000 and given a two match touchline ban (suspended for 12 months). A second charge relating to the same referee was brought by [[the Football Association]], heard on 16 May 2007, and was found not proven.<ref name="Jewell hits out at referee Dowd">{{cite news | title = Jewell hits out at referee Dowd | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6352493.stm | work = BBC Sport | date = 12 February 2007 | access-date = 14 May 2007}}</ref><ref name="JEWELL HEARING DATE SET">{{cite news |title=Jewell hearing date set |url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer%2F07%2F04%2F30%2FSOCCER_Wigan.html&TEAMHD=soccer |newspaper=Sporting Life |access-date=14 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314020656/http://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer%2F07%2F04%2F30%2FSOCCER_Wigan.html&TEAMHD=soccer |archive-date=14 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/Disciplinary/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/Jewellchargenotproved.htm Verdict] in the Paul Jewell FA disciplinary case: TheFA.com website.</ref>

On the final day of the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] season, Jewell steered Wigan safe from relegation after a win against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] at [[Bramall Lane]] on 13 May 2007. A day later, Jewell resigned as Wigan manager for health reasons.<ref name="Jewell resigns as Wigan manager">One reason for Jewell's resignation from Wigan was because he was under a lot of stress.{{cite news | title = Jewell resigns as Wigan manager | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wigan_athletic/6653185.stm | work = BBC Sport | date = 14 May 2007 | access-date = 14 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=466601&CPID=8&clid=111&lid=2&title=Jewell+steps+down+at+Wigan&channel=football_home&|title=Jewell steps down at Wigan|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=14 May 2007|access-date=14 May 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516041908/http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=466601&CPID=8&clid=111&lid=2&title=Jewell+steps+down+at+Wigan&channel=football_home&|archive-date=16 May 2007}}</ref>

===Derby County===
After leaving Wigan, Jewell was linked with various vacant managerial positions at the start of the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08]] season. He was linked twice to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]];<ref>[http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=132385&command=displayContent&sourceNode=132378&contentPK=18251781&folderPk=77460&pNodeId=132401 JEWELL TIPPED FOR CITY JOB]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Leicester Mercury 30 August 2007.

In the 2011 summer transfer window, Jewell signed a number of experienced players, with former [[England national football team|England]] international [[Lee Bowyer]] and experienced striker [[Nathan Ellington]] joining on free transfers, as well as strikers [[Michael Chopra]] and [[Jay Emmanuel-Thomas]] signing for six figure fees. Ipswich started the 2011–12 season with a 3–0 away win against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/14351931.stm|title=Bristol City 0 - 3 Ipswich Town |date=6 August 2011|work=BBC Sport|access-date=7 February 2023}}</ref> although the team then went on to lose the next three league games, including heavy defeats against Southampton and Peterborough United. An upturn in form followed with Ipswich winning five of their next eight league matches. Following this upturn in form saw Jewell's Ipswich lose seven games in a row, dropped Ipswich from 6th to 21st place. Ipswich next traveled to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] where, in front of the Sky cameras, they won 5–3, coming from 2–0 down at half time.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/16015685.stm|title=Barnsley 3 - 5 Ipswich Town |date=10 December 2011|work=BBC Sport|access-date=7 February 2023}}</ref> In the following match, Jewell celebrated his 550th game as a manager as Ipswich won 1–0 against his former club Derby County at [[Portman Road]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/16123477.stm|title=Ipswich Town 1 - 0 Derby County |date=17 December 2011|work=BBC Sport|access-date=7 February 2023}}</ref> Ipswich's inconsistent form continued into 2012, a 1–1 draw against Leicester City on boxing day started a six game win less run which was ended on 31st January as Ipswich defeated West Ham United 5–1 at Portman Road.

Ipswich also exited the FA Cup at the third round stage and the League Cup in the first round, failing to progress in either competition.
