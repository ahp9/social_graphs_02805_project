'''Terence McDermott''' (born 8 December 1951) is an English former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[midfielder]]. Nicknamed '''"Terry Mac"''',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/announcements/263646-terry-mac-s-guide-to-the-class-of-77|title=Terry Mac's guide to the class of '77|publisher=Liverpool F.C.|first=Steve|last=Hunter|date=25 May 2017|access-date=11 February 2024}}</ref> he is best known as a member of the [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] team of the 1970s and early 1980s, where he won three [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]] and five [[Football League First Division|First Division]] titles. Either side of his time at [[Anfield]], he played for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], with his second stint seeing him reunite with former Liverpool teammate [[Kevin Keegan]]. Internationally, he was capped 25 times for [[England national football team|England]], and was part of the [[UEFA Euro 1980]] and the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] squads.

McDermott has had an extensive coaching career, returning to Newcastle to be Keegan's assistant manager, and would be kept on following [[Kenny Dalglish]]'s appointment as manager. He joined [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in 1999 to be [[John Barnes]]' assistant. McDermott returned to Newcastle again to be one of [[Graeme Souness]]' assistants and remained with the club until 2008, which included a short reunion with Keegan. He then became [[Lee Clark (footballer)|Lee Clark]]'s assistant at [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] and [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].

==Playing career==

===Early career===
McDermott joined [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as a youngster in 1969. He made a total of 90 appearances and eight goals before joining [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 1973. Manager [[Joe Harvey (footballer)|Joe Harvey]] gave McDermott his Newcastle debut on 17 March 1973, at [[Old Trafford]] against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. He came off the bench but could not do anything to prevent Newcastle losing 2–1.

McDermott reached the [[1974 FA Cup final|FA Cup final]] in [[1973–74 in English football|1974]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. However, Newcastle lost the match 3–0.

===Liverpool===
[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] boss [[Bob Paisley]], in his first season in charge after replacing [[Bill Shankly]], brought McDermott to Merseyside in November 1974. McDermott made his Liverpool debut on 16 November, as did [[Phil Neal]], in a [[Merseyside derby]] against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at [[Goodison Park]]. Neither side could break the deadlock with both sides sharing the points. McDermott's first goal came in a 1–1 league draw with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] at [[Turf Moor]] on 8 March 1975.

For the next two years, McDermott struggled to get into the team or hold down a place once given his chance. Liverpool won the [[Football League First Division|League championship]] and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in the [[1975–76 in English football|1975–76 season]] but McDermott did not play in enough matches to pick up a League medal, although he was in the squad which won in Europe. Speculation mounted that he would move on in the summer of 1976, but instead he stayed at [[Anfield]] and became an integral part of the [[1976–77 in English football|following season]]'s triumphs.

McDermott was a fixture in the 1977 side that retained the title. Meanwhile, his goal against Everton in the semi-final of the [[FA Cup]], a turn and chip from the edge of the penalty area, was voted the "[[BBC Goal of the Season|Goal of the Season]]" by the [[BBC]].<ref>Motson (2010), p. 91.</ref> That game finished 2–2, with Liverpool winning the replay. A subsequent success in a [[1976–77 European Cup#Semi-finals|European Cup semi-final]] meant that Liverpool had reached the finals of both the FA Cup and European Cup, which were scheduled to be played respectively at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] and at Rome's [[Stadio Olimpico]] within four days of each other in May 1977. However, Liverpool were defeated in the [[1977 FA Cup final|FA Cup final]] by Manchester United, which ended their "treble" dream.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1977.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015033325/http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1977.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 October 2011|title=Manchester United 2 Liverpool 1|website=FA Cup Finals|access-date=26 June 2020}}</ref> There was joy for McDermott four days later, though, when he opened the scoring in the [[1977 European Cup final|European Cup final]] against [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] as Liverpool won 3–1.<ref name="kelly">{{harvtxt|Kelly|1988|p=125}}</ref>

On 6 December 1977, he scored a [[hat-trick]] in the second leg of Liverpool's victory over Hamburg in the [[1977 UEFA Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup Final]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/news/y=2012/m=9/news=prolific-predators-droughts-and-drubbing-1695220.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022160446/http://www.fifa.com/news/y=2012/m=9/news=prolific-predators-droughts-and-drubbing-1695220.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 October 2015|title=Prolific predators, droughts and a drubbing|date=5 September 2012|work=FIFA.com|access-date=14 October 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Liverpool reached their first [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final in [[1978 Football League Cup final|1978]] and this occasion was to prove memorable for McDermott for the wrong reasons. The first game at Wembley against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] ended goalless, but McDermott had a goal disallowed after the officials decided that [[Kenny Dalglish]] was in an [[Offside (association football)|offside]] position when McDermott struck his shot. In the replay at [[Old Trafford]], after Forest had opened the scoring with a hotly disputed penalty, McDermott scored what he thought was the equaliser with a well-struck drive, only for the officials to deny him again, claiming he had controlled the pass with his arm. Forest held on to win 1–0 and McDermott offered to swear on oath in an after-match interview that he had trapped the ball legally with his chest.

Consolation at missing out on the League Cup was found at the end of the [[1977–78 in English football|season]] when McDermott featured in the Liverpool team which retained the [[1978 European Cup final|European Cup]] thanks to a 1–0 win over [[Club Brugge]] at Wembley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/timeline/1970-1995/wembley-glory-as-reds-beat-bruges |title=Wembley glory as Reds beat Bruges |publisher=Liverpool F.C |access-date=24 April 2011 }}</ref>

The [[1978–79 in English football|following season]], McDermott scored one of Liverpool's most memorable goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thisisanfield.com/2016/08/liverpool-7-0-tottenham-1978-anfields-greatest-goal-paisleys-reds-destroy-spurs/|title=Liverpool 7-0 Tottenham (1978) – Anfield's greatest goal as Paisley's Reds destroy Spurs|website=This Is Anfield|date=16 August 2016|access-date=26 June 2020}}</ref> It came at Anfield in a League match against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 2 September 1978. Liverpool were defending a corner which was cleared from their own penalty area to striker [[David Johnson (footballer, born 1951)|David Johnson]], who hit a long pass to the sprinting winger [[Steve Heighway]] on the left flank as McDermott started to chase forward. Within just a few seconds, the ball was in the Spurs net as Heighway raced down the line and crossed the ball, without stopping to control it, for McDermott to head home after a 70-yard run. This was the final goal in a 7–0 win.

By the end of that season, McDermott and Liverpool were champions again and they retained the title in [[1979–80 in English football|1980]], with McDermott being voted the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] and the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] - the first player to win both awards in the same season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lfconline.co.uk/news/tmnw/the_8_liverpool_players_that_have_won_the_pfa_players_player_of_the_year_award_930876/index.shtml|title=The 8 Liverpool Players That Have Won The PFA Players Player Of The Year Award|website=LFC Online|access-date=26 June 2020}}</ref> He scored another memorable goal against Tottenham that season, this time in the FA Cup at [[White Hart Lane]], when he took a misplaced pass from [[Osvaldo Ardiles]] on the right hand corner of the penalty area, flicked the ball into the air and hit a lob-volley into the far corner of the goal.

In [[1981 Football League Cup final|1981]], McDermott featured as Liverpool beat [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] after a replay to win the League Cup for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shea |first=Julian |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/4753743.stm |title=BBC SPORT &#124; Football &#124; FA Cup &#124; FA Cup flashback |publisher=BBC News |date=10 May 2006 |access-date=21 January 2011}}</ref> Later that season, he appeared in the team that defeated [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] in the [[1981 European Cup final|European Cup final]].<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/647 |title=Liverpool keep it in the family |work=The Guardian |date=27 May 1981 |access-date=17 September 2011 |first=David |last=Lacey }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=1908/81: Paisley in a class of his own|date=27 May 1981 |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0089-0e6a09dbb4da-9dc4666bbc2c-1000/|access-date=22 June 2020|publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)}}</ref> A further League title and League Cup followed in [[1981–82 in English football|1982]] but his place in the side was becoming less assured.

===Later career===
McDermott returned to Newcastle United in September 1982. At Newcastle, he featured alongside his former Liverpool teammate [[Kevin Keegan]], and youngsters [[Chris Waddle]] and [[Peter Beardsley]], as Newcastle won promotion back to the top flight of [[English football]] in 1984.<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Powter |title=Newcastle United F.C. The 25 Year Record |year=1995 |publisher=Soccer Books Publishing Ltd |isbn=0-947808-54-X}}</ref> McDermott left Newcastle in January 1985 and moved abroad to play with [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] in Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.the42.ie/how-a-liverpool-legend-ended-up-in-the-league-of-ireland-3357643-Apr2017/ |title='Where's Cork?' How a Liverpool legend ended up in the League of Ireland |date=26 April 2017 |work=The 42 |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref>

From 1985 to 1987, McDermott played for the Cypriot club [[APOEL FC|APOEL]], alongside [[Ian Moores]], where he won the [[Cypriot First Division|Cypriot Championship]] and the [[Cypriot Super Cup]].

==International career==
On 7 September 1977, [[Ron Greenwood]] gave McDermott his debut for [[England national football team|England]] in a 0–0 friendly draw with [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. He opened his goalscoring account on 10 September 1980 during a [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifier at Wembley against [[Norway national football team|Norway]]. McDermott scored twice, including a penalty, as England won 4–0.

McDermott was selected for the England squad which travelled to the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 European Championships]] in Italy. He played in two of the group games. McDermott was also picked for the England squad for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] in Spain but did not play, despite having featured in every qualifying game. He never played for England again and only featured as a substitute in one match for Liverpool the following season.

In his England career, he had been capped 25 times at senior level, and scored three goals.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamPlyrsBios/PlayersMc/BioMcDermottT.html|title=England Players - Terry McDermott|website=englandfootballonline.com|access-date=11 February 2024}}</ref>

==Coaching career==
When [[Kevin Keegan]] became manager of Newcastle on 5 February 1992, he recruited McDermott as his first team coach. Together, the two masterminded a return to the top of the English game for Newcastle, which included a close run to the [[Premier League|League]] title in [[1995–96 FA Premier League|1996]], eventually won by Manchester United. After Keegan resigned, McDermott stayed at Newcastle for a further season under [[Kenny Dalglish]]. He left the club when Dalglish resigned and his successor [[Ruud Gullit]] decided to bring in his own coach.

When [[John Barnes]] was appointed as head coach of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] on 8 June 1999, he appointed McDermott as assistant head coach alongside [[Eric Black]], before they were all sacked following the [[Scottish Cup]] defeat by [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] in February 2000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/637415.stm |title=Barnes forced out |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=10 February 2000 |access-date=22 August 2021}}</ref>

In 2005, McDermott returned to Newcastle after he was recruited by manager [[Graeme Souness]] to work as a coach. After the sacking of Souness in February 2006, McDermott stayed on under managers [[Glenn Roeder]], [[Sam Allardyce]] and Keegan once again. When Keegan quit in September 2008, McDermott also left, along with [[Adam Sadler]].<ref name="Hughton handed Magpies reins">{{cite news| title = Hughton handed Magpies reins| url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_4117052,00.html| publisher = skysports.com| date = 8 September 2008| access-date = 8 September 2008}}</ref>

On 19 December 2008, McDermott was named assistant manager of [[Football League One|League One]] side [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], effectively becoming [[Lee Clark (footballer)|Lee Clark]]'s right-hand man.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/19122008/1/mcdermott-new-town-assistant.html |title=McDermott New Town Assistant |publisher=[[EuroSport]] – [[Yahoo!]] |date=19 December 2008 |access-date=19 December 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Following the sacking of Clark in February 2012, McDermott was also sacked.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17042572|title=Huddersfield Town sack manager Lee Clark|publisher=BBC|date=15 February 2012}}</ref> In June 2012, he joined [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] as Clark's assistant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfc.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10412~2823589,00.html |title=Clark confirmed as Blues boss |publisher=Birmingham City F.C |date=26 June 2012 |access-date=26 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629104944/http://www.bcfc.com/page/News/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10412~2823589%2C00.html |archive-date=29 June 2012  }}</ref> On 17 February 2014, it was widely reported that he and first-team coach [[Derek Fazackerley]] had left Birmingham;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/26228918 |title=Birmingham City: McDermott & Fazackerley future in doubt |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 February 2014 |access-date=18 February 2014}}</ref> this was later confirmed by the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/28/terry-mcdermott-derek-fazackerley-birmingham |title=McDermott and Fazackerley leave Birmingham City by mutual consent |work=The Guardian|date=28 February 2014 }}</ref>
