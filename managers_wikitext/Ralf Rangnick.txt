'''Ralf Dietrich Rangnick''' ({{IPA|de|ʁalf ˈdiːtʁɪç ˈʁaŋnɪk|lang}}; born 29 June 1958) is a German professional [[Association football|football]] coach, executive, and former player who is currently the head coach of the [[Austria national football team|Austria national team]].

Rangnick began his coaching career in 1983, succeeding his career as a player, at age 25. In 1997, he was hired by former club [[SSV Ulm 1846|Ulm 1846]], with whom he won the [[Regionalliga Süd (1994–2012)|Regionalliga Süd]] in his debut season. Rangnick was then appointed by [[Bundesliga]] club [[VfB Stuttgart]], winning the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in 2000, but was dismissed in 2001. He subsequently joined [[Hannover 96]], winning the [[2. Bundesliga]], but was dismissed in 2004. After a brief period with [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], Rangnick joined [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|TSG Hoffenheim]] in 2006, and achieved successive promotions to the Bundesliga. He departed the club in 2011 and returned to Schalke 04, where he won the [[2010–11 DFB-Pokal|2011 DFB-Pokal]] and reached the semi-finals of the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League#Semi-finals|UEFA Champions League]]. He later served as head coach at [[RB Leipzig]] across two periods between 2015 and 2019.

Rangnick joined [[Red Bull GmbH#Football|Red Bull]] as [[director of football]] in 2012, helping oversee their expansion into European football, emphasising the recruitment of unproven players and developing [[youth system]]s with a worldwide scouting base and an attacking on-pitch philosophy across their clubs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Implementing a radical strategy at Red Bull's football teams |url=https://www.ft.com/content/51719760-b6a0-4f3f-81ba-970b299f8e53 |access-date=20 September 2020 |work=ft.com |publisher=Financial Times|date=20 September 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Ralf Rangnick: The catalyst for RB Leipzig's success|url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/who-is-ralf-rangnick-rb-leipzig-coach-sporting-director-red-bull-franchise-5099|access-date=8 March 2020|website=bundesliga.com |publisher=Bundesliga|date=8 March 2020}}</ref> As a result, Red Bull clubs rose in market value from €120&nbsp;million to €1.2&nbsp;billion during his tenure.<ref name="The New York Times">{{cite news |title=The Oracle Is Speaking Again.

==Coaching career==
Rangnick was one of the first coaches to publicise football tactics, notably during a ZDF SportsStudio TV broadcast in December 1998. As a result, Rangnick became known as the "professor"; a title initially used to jeer him, which then grew to be used to show respect.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdptfWFOLkQ |title=Ralf Rangnick Sportstudio 1998 Viererkette |work=ZDF Sportstudio, tactics board |date=19 December 1998 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title="Fußballprofessor" Ralf Rangnick: Karriere, Erfolge, Vereine – alle Infos zum ehemaligen Hoffenheim-Trainer |url=https://www.heidelberg24.de/sport/tsg-1899-hoffenheim/ralf-rangnick-karriere-leben-erfolge-vereine-tsg-hoffenheim-red-bull-leipzig-frau-stiftung-13639021.html |access-date=12 April 2020|work=www.heidelberg24.de |publisher=Heidelberg24|date=12 April 2020}}</ref>

===Early career===

In 1988, he became the head coach at SC Korb, remaining for two seasons before returning to [[VfB Stuttgart]] for four seasons to manage the Under 19 team. In 1991, he won the U-19 Bundesliga (German: A-Junioren Bundesliga), the highest honor in German U-19 football. Rangnick then returned to first team management in 1995 with two seasons as head coach at [[SSV Reutlingen 05|Reutlingen 05]].<ref name=rangnickjobs>{{cite web|title=Ralf Rangnick|url=https://www.kicker.de/ralf-rangnick/trainer|publisher=kicker|access-date=1 February 2013|language=de}}</ref> He took the club to a fourth-place finish in his first season.<ref name="1995–96 season">{{cite web|title=Regionalliga Süd (1994–2000) – Spieltag / Tabelle|url=https://www.kicker.de/rl-sued-1994-2000/spieltag/1995-96/34/0|website=[[Kicker (magazine)|Kicker]]|publisher=kicker|access-date=4 January 2017|language=de}}</ref> They began the following campaign strong, with the club in the midst of the promotion push by Christmas.

During the winter break of his second season, he signed a deal to move to top flight VfB Stuttgart for the next season. This was supposed to remain secret until the end of the season, but in February it was leaked out into public knowledge.
