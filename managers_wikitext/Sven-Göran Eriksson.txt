'''Sven-Göran Eriksson''' ({{IPA|sv|svɛnˈjœ̂ːran ˈêːrɪkˌsɔn|-|sv-Sven-Göran_Eriksson.ogg}}; 5 February 1948 – 26 August 2024) was a Swedish [[association football|football]] player and [[Coach (sport)|manager]]. After a playing career as a [[right-back]], Eriksson went on to experience major success in club management between 1977 and 2001, winning 18 trophies with a variety of league clubs in Sweden, Portugal, and Italy. In European competition, he won the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in [[1982 UEFA Cup final|1982]], the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1999 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final|1999]], the last edition of the tournament before its abolition, the [[UEFA Super Cup]] in [[1999 UEFA Super Cup|1999]], and reached the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] final in [[1990 European Cup final|1990]].

Eriksson later managed the national teams of [[England national football team|England]], [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], the [[Philippines national football team|Philippines]] and the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]], as well as [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in England. Eriksson coached in ten countries: Sweden, Portugal, Italy, England, Mexico, Ivory Coast, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, China, and the Philippines.

==Early life==
Sven-Göran Eriksson was born on 5 February 1948<ref name=soccerway>{{cite web | title=Sven-Göran Eriksson | website=Soccerway | url=https://au.soccerway.com/coaches/sven-goran-eriksson/130176/#bd | access-date=11 January 2024}}</ref> in [[Sunne, Sweden|Sunne]]<ref name=BDFutbol/> and raised in [[Torsby]], both in [[Värmland]], Sweden. His father, also named Sven (born 1929), was a bus conductor whilst his mother, Ulla (1926–2011), worked in a textile store.<ref>{{harvnb|Eriksson|Lovgren|2013|p=9}}</ref> He was nicknamed "Svennis" after his younger brother Lars-Erik's attempt to pronounce his name; Eriksson went on to become known, and is generally referred to in Sweden [[mononym]]ously, by this nickname.<ref>{{harvnb|Eriksson|Lovgren|2013|p=15}}</ref><ref name="When Saturdays Comes">{{cite web|title=The Tord Way|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/3093/29/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617061017/http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/3093/29/|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 June 2010|publisher=When Saturday Comes|access-date=29 June 2009}}</ref>

==Playing career==
Eriksson made his debut for [[Swedish football Division 4]] team Torsby IF at the age of 16.<ref>{{harvnb|Eriksson|Lovgren|2013|p=17}}</ref> He switched clubs to SK Sifhälla after moving to [[Säffle]] to study economics.<ref>{{harvnb|Eriksson|Lovgren|2013|p=20}}</ref> In 1972, he joined [[Swedish football Division 2]] team [[KB Karlskoga FF|KB Karlskoga]], where he also worked as a physical education teacher in [[Örebro]].<ref name=invertingpyramid>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Jonathan|date=2009|title=Inverting the Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics|publisher=Orion Books |isbn=978-1-4091-0204-5 |pages=299–301}}</ref>

Eriksson was heavily influenced by Karlskoga's player-manager, [[Tord Grip]], who favoured the English style of play that [[Bob Houghton]] and [[Roy Hodgson]] had brought to the country.<ref name=invertingpyramid/> Eriksson retired from playing in 1975 at the age of 27, after giving up on his dream of playing professional football; he summed up his brief playing career by saying: "I was looked upon as a distinctly average defender, but someone who rarely made mistakes".<ref>{{harvnb|Eriksson|Lovgren|2013|p=23}}</ref>

==Managerial career==

===Degerfors IF===
Having retired as a player, Eriksson received an offer to become Tord Grip's assistant at [[Degerfors IF]].<ref name=invertingpyramid/><ref>{{cite book|last=Lovejoy|first=Joe|title=Sven: The Final Reckoning |year=2004|publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=0-00-714069-X}}p78</ref> A year later, Grip was appointed assistant manager of the [[Sweden men's national football team|Sweden national team]], and Eriksson became Degerfors' manager. His stint as manager lasted from 1 January 1977 to 31 December 1978.<ref name=degerforsjob>{{cite web|title=Degerfors IF .:. Coaches from A-Z|url=https://www.worldfootball.net/teams/te458/degerfors-if/all-managers/|publisher=World Football|access-date=13 February 2013}}</ref> He led the team to the playoffs in 1977 and 1978, winning the latter and promotion to Swedish Football Division 2.<ref name=invertingpyramid/>

===IFK Göteborg===
Eriksson's success with assistant manager Tom Chadney by his side attracted the attention of much larger clubs, and Eriksson was appointed manager of [[IFK Göteborg]] on 1 January 1979.<ref name=goteborgjob>{{cite web|title=IFK Göteborg .:. Coaches from A-Z|url=https://www.worldfootball.net/teams/te1022/ifk-goeteborg/all-managers/|publisher=World Football|access-date=13 February 2013}}</ref> The move was such a surprise that many of the players had never even heard of him.<ref name=invertingpyramid/>

IFK finished second in [[1978 Allsvenskan|the Allsvenskan]] and won the [[Svenska Cupen]] for the first time in the club's history, defeating [[Åtvidabergs FF]] 6–1 in the final.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablesz/zwedcuphist.html |title=Svenska Cupen |work=RSSSF |accessdate=26 August 2024}}</ref>  Although results had improved, the team's style did not make him popular. He put results ahead of flair, emphasised tactical awareness and work rate, and he reined in the team's old cavalier style.<ref name=invertingpyramid/>

As a consequence, the average attendance fell by 3,000 to 13,320.<ref name=invertingpyramid/> Like Grip, he was influenced by Houghton and Hodgson and played a 4–4–2 with zonal marking and heavy pressing.<ref name=invertingpyramid/> IFK finished third in the [[1980 Allsvenskan|1980 season]] and second again in [[1981 Allsvenskan|1981]]. The following season, they won the [[treble (association football)|treble]]. The team won the [[1982 Allsvenskan|League]] and subsequent playoff, the Svenska Cupen, defeating [[Östers IF]] 3–2 in the final.<ref>[http://www.ifkgoteborg.se/mobil/Nyheter/Nyhet/?v=5744]{{Dead link|date=December 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

Eriksson's international breakthrough came during the spring of 1982, when he led IFK to the first ever [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] for a Swedish club, defeating [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] in the quarter-finals and [[1. FC Kaiserslautern|Kaiserslautern]] in the semi-finals. In the [[1982 UEFA Cup final|final]] they played [[Hamburger SV]] over two legs.<ref name=ue /> In the first leg at home, IFK managed to score a late deciding goal, and took a 1–0 score with them to the away fixture. In Hamburg, they won 3–0 and thus won the [[1981–82 UEFA Cup]] by an aggregate score of 4–0.<ref name=ue>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=1981/matches/all/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115041214/http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=1981/matches/all/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 January 2012|title=1981–82 Matches|publisher=UEFA}}</ref>

===Benfica===
Eriksson's European success led to him being recruited by Portuguese club [[S.L.

Eriksson led the Portuguese side to the [[1990 European Cup final|final]] of the [[1989–90 European Cup]] (losing to [[AC Milan|Milan]] 1–0) in 1990, and another Primeira Divisão title in [[1990–91 Primeira Divisão|1991]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sven-Goran Eriksson factfile |author= |work=the Guardian |date= 9 January 2001|access-date=26 August 2024 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/jan/09/newsstory.sport9}}</ref>

Coaches from A-Z|url=https://www.worldfootball.net/teams/te1609/sampdoria/all-managers/|publisher=World Football|access-date=13 February 2013}}</ref> where he managed to win another [[1993–94 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] in 1994. In contrast to his predecessor, [[Vujadin Boškov]], he introduced a defensive system which was based on zonal marking rather than man-marking.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1992/08/30/buso-jugovic-la-samp-si-sveglia.html |title=BUSO E JUGOVIC LA SAMP SI SVEGLIA |work=La Repubblica |language=it |last1=Massinissa |first1=Gianni |date=30 August 1992 |access-date=26 October 2019}}</ref> He left in June 1997.<ref name=sampdoriajob/>

This was the first time that England had lost to these opponents since 1972, and the first time in [[Belfast]] since 1927.<ref>{{cite news |last=McCarra |first=Kevin |title=England are humiliated |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/sep/08/match.sport3 |access-date=17 July 2024 |work=The Guardian |date=8 September 2005}}</ref> Although it was England's first-ever defeat in a World Cup or European Championship qualifying match under Eriksson, it brought his position under pressure and he was criticised, both by some fans and by commentators from the [[BBC Sport|BBC]], for his alleged lack of charisma and tactical awareness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2005/i/sezioni/sport/calcio/eriks/eriks/eriks.html|title=Insulti e accuse a Eriksson "Cacciate via quello stupido"|trans-title=Insults and accusations towards Eriksson "Chase that idiot out"|author=Emilio Marrese|website=La Repubblcia|date=9 September 2005|language=it}}</ref> 

In January 2006, Eriksson was recorded saying he would be willing to leave England to manage [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] if England won the World Cup, after being duped into believing that a wealthy Arab would buy the club, and wanted him as manager. The wealthy "Arab" was in fact the "Fake Sheikh" [[Mazher Mahmood]], an undercover ''[[News of the World]]'' reporter. On 23 January, The FA announced that Eriksson would leave his job after the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], and it was thought that the ''News of the World'' allegations played a part in this decision.<ref name=englandsacking>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4641682.stm|title=Eriksson to quit after World Cup|work=BBC Sport|access-date=7 July 2007|date=23 January 2006}}</ref>

England finished top of Group B at the finals, beating [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]], before a 2–2 draw with Sweden, although the English press considered their performances far from satisfactory.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5084934.stm|title=England stumble on|work=BBC Sport|access-date=7 July 2007|date=15 June 2006|first=Phil|last=McNulty}}</ref> After defeating [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] by a single Beckham free kick in the last 16, England were again eliminated on penalties by Portugal in the quarter-finals.<ref name=mcnulty>{{cite news |last=McNulty |first=Phil |title=Sven's sorry exit |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5139274.stm |access-date=17 July 2024 |work=BBC Sport |date=2 July 2006}}</ref>

BBC Sport pundit [[Phil McNulty]] wrote a scathing review of Eriksson's period in charge, writing that he was unable to change games after England went behind, refused to drop Beckham and could not combine [[Frank Lampard]] and [[Steven Gerrard]] in midfield. McNulty added that Eriksson had chosen [[Theo Walcott]] for the 2006 World Cup without watching him play, and never fielded the Arsenal player, who had been chosen ahead of  [[Jermain Defoe]]. Reflecting that Eriksson had taken over £20 million in salary, McNulty wrote "he will be remembered as a failure and a mighty pricey one at that".<ref name=mcnulty/>

Eriksson improved England's [[FIFA World Rankings]] place from seventeenth place in January 2001 to fifth in July 2006, reaching fourth during the 2006 World Cup, and was rated in 2007 by The FA as England's second most successful manager after [[Alf Ramsey]].

On 11 February 2009, Eriksson was put under further pressure as his side lost 2–0 to the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]. Calls for him to quit or be sacked were heard from the fans while English club [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] were rumoured to be interested in making him their new manager.

==Style of management==
Considered to be one of the greatest managers of all time,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2019/06/14/sven-goran-eriksson-former-england-lazio-managers-all-time-best-xi |title=Sven-Goran Eriksson: The Former England & Lazio Manager's All-Time Best XI |publisher=Sports Illustrated |language=en-us |date=14 June 2019 |access-date=11 June 2024 }}</ref> tactically, Eriksson was initially inspired by the style of his former teammate and manager [[Tord Grip]] early into his coaching career, who was in turn influenced by that of English managers Bob Houghton and Roy Hodgson, who introduced an innovative 4–4–2 formation into Swedish football, which made use of zonal marking and heavy pressing. While Eriksson's style was successful at IFK Göteborg, he also drew criticism from the fans for being overly pragmatic as a coach, with a focus on getting results over playing with flair, and placing a particular emphasis on the tactical awareness and work-rate of his teams.<ref name=invertingpyramid/><ref name="Svezia in cima all'Europa">{{cite web |url=https://www.mondosportivo.it/2013/11/06/cera-europa-il-goteborg-che-porto-la-svezia-cima-alleuropa/ |title=C'era in Europa: il Goteborg che portò la Svezia in cima all'Europa |publisher=mondosportivo.it |language=it |date=6 November 2013 |access-date=11 June 2024 }}</ref><ref name="4–4–2-England">{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/05/euro-2012-roy-hodgson-england-tactics |title=The Question: Does 4–4–2 work for England? |work=The Guardian |date=5 June 2012 |access-date=20 June 2012 |archive-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516175440/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/05/euro-2012-roy-hodgson-england-tactics |url-status=live}}</ref>

During his time at Lazio, he also used a fluid 4–5–1 formation at times, in particular during the 1999–2000 season, which could become a 4–2–3–1, a 4–3–3, a 4–1–4–1, or a 4–4–2 throughout the course of a match. The team's gameplay was primarily based on creating a numerical advantage in the opposing half rather than controlling the ball, and through looking to attack and score as quickly as possible, while minimising risk. During the opening of matches, the team often played a vertical passing game, making use of long balls out from the back in an attempt to stretch their opponents, and create spaces for the team's more creative players to exploit. If this was done successfully, throughout the course of the match, the team would then play a series of many quick short passes in a more organised manner to build attacks. Eriksson also utilised the flanks offensively. He also placed significant importance on the physical and mental qualities of his players. Defensively, his team still made use of pressing further up the pitch, and the team's formation would transform into an organised and compact 4–1–4–1 with little distance between the lines. At times, the team's defensive set-up made them vulnerable to counter-attacks or one-twos if their opponents broke through the first line, however, which allowed teams to play through them on occasion. In the first third of the pitch, Lazio would drop deeper to defend. While Eriksson used a zonal marking system in Sweden, at Lazio, he instead used a strategy which resembled the ''[[zona mista]]'', which was a cross between zonal marking and man-to-man marking systems.<ref name="Svezia in cima all'Europa"/><ref name="Come giocava la Lazio">{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimouomo.com/come-giocava-la-lazio-dello-scudetto/ |title=Come giocava la Lazio dello scudetto |publisher=L'Ultimo Uomo |language=it-IT |date=11 January 2019 |access-date=11 June 2024 }}</ref> Eriksson often rotated his players at Lazio.

On the flanks, he often alternated [[Pavel Nedvěd]], [[Roberto Mancini]], or [[Alen Bokšić]] on the left, and one of [[Sérgio Conceição]], [[Attilio Lombardo]] or [[Dejan Stanković]] on the right. All the team's midfielders were given the freedom to switch positions, to help give the team a numerical advantage in midfield when in possession, except for the deepest defensive midfielder, and the right winger; the latter was expected to push up the flank, take on opponents in one on one situations, and provide crosses into the box. The left winger, depending on the team selection, would often drift into the centre, either to support the midfield or the main striker, or make runs off the ball to get on the end of passes; he would also drop back into midfield to assist the team defensively off the ball, and cover for the full-backs.<ref name="Come giocava la Lazio"/><ref name="Eriksson spiega come giocava"/> Eriksson was also praised for using [[Juan Sebastián Verón]] in a deeper playmaking role in midfield at Lazio behind the forwards, rather than in the more advanced role he had played at [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]], which had a positive impact on his performances.<ref name="Come giocava la Lazio"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2000/maggio/17/stile_Eriksson_conquista_tutti_ga_0_0005177802.shtml |title=Lo stile Eriksson conquista tutti |work=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=it |last1=Piccioni |first1=Valerio |last2=Nicita |first2=Maurizio |date=17 May 2000 |access-date=11 June 2024 }}</ref> The team were also known for their effectiveness from set-pieces.<ref name="Come giocava la Lazio"/> Eriksson initially fielded two strikers – [[Marcelo Salas]] and [[Simone Inzaghi]] – before abandoning this system early into the 1999–2000 season, alternating one of them up-front as a lone centre-forward; Inzaghi would provide depth to the team with his runs, or get onto the end of passes and score, while Salas would look to get onto the end of crosses and long balls, or drop deep to link-up with the midfield and hold up the ball.<ref name="Come giocava la Lazio"/>

During his time as England's manager, however, Eriksson did come under criticism from pundits and the public for fielding [[Paul Scholes]] out of position, seemingly as a left midfielder, at Euro 2004, rather than in the centre, in order to accommodate [[Frank Lampard]] and Steven Gerrard in midfield; Eriksson defended this decision, however, stating that other players were not as adept in that role, and that he wanted to field his four strongest midfielders. He elaborated that Scholes was also given the freedom to move into the centre to help the midfield and receive the ball, something which Scholes himself confirmed, likening it to a role he had also played successfully under his Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-paul-scholes-gerrard-24171652 |title=Sven-Goran Eriksson clarifies left wing call on Man United icon Paul Scholes |work=Manchester Evening News |last1=Smith |first1=George |language=en |date=8 June 2022 |access-date=11 June 2024 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11966866/paul-scholes-myth-england-career-not-wasted-by-sven-goran-eriksson |title=Paul Scholes' myth: England career not wasted by Sven Goran Eriksson |work=Sky Sports |last1=Bate |first1=Adam |date=4 April 2020 |access-date=11 June 2024 }}</ref> 

In addition to his success and tactical prowess, Eriksson was also known for his positive leadership style as a manager, which also influenced [[Carlo Ancelotti]]'s coaching style during their time together at Roma in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.ph/football/story/_/id/37933346/soccer-coaching-tree-modern-game-roots-go-cruyff |title=Soccer's coaching tree: Modern game's roots go beyond Cruyff |work=ESPN.com |language=en |date=29 June 2023 |access-date=11 June 2024 }}</ref> His coaching style at Lazio influenced his former Lazio players Simone Inzaghi, Diego Simeone, Roberto Mancini, and Matías Almeyda, who also went on to pursue coaching careers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.novantesimo.com/limportanza-di-essere-allenati-da-sven-goran-eriksson/ |title=Sven-Göran Eriksson e i suoi 'figli': da Inzaghi a Simeone |publisher=novantesimo.com |last1=Attanasio |first1=Christian |language=it |date=15 May 2020 |access-date=11 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418232801/https://www.novantesimo.com/limportanza-di-essere-allenati-da-sven-goran-eriksson/ |archive-date=18 April 2021 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
