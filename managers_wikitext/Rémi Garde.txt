'''Rémi Marie François Garde''' ({{IPA|fr|ʁemi ɡaʁd}}, born 3 April 1966) is a  French former professional [[association football|footballer]]. He was most recently the head coach of [[Montreal Impact (2012–2020)|Montreal Impact]] in [[Major League Soccer]].

He played as a [[defender (association football)|defender]] and [[defensive midfielder]], spending most of his career with his first club [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], with whom he won the [[1988–89 French Division 2]]. In 1993, he moved to [[RC Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], reaching the [[Coupe de France]] final and winning the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in his second season. He joined [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1996, where he won the [[1997–98 FA Premier League]] before retiring through injury a year later. Garde was [[Cap (sport)|capped]] by the [[France national football team|France national team]], featuring in their squad at [[UEFA Euro 1992]].<ref name=Eurosport>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/remi-garde_prs211738/person.shtml|title=Remi Garde|website=Eurosport.com}}</ref>

Upon retirement as a player, he worked as a coach and assistant manager at Lyon, before taking the managerial position there in 2011. He won the Coupe de France and [[Trophée des Champions]] the following year, and left in 2014 for personal reasons. He was hired by [[Aston Villa]] in November 2015, and left five months later. He was hired by Montreal Impact in [[Major League Soccer]] in November 2017, and was sacked in August 2019.

==Club career==
Born in [[L'Arbresle]], Rhône,<ref name="lequipe"/> Garde started his playing career at nearby [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in 1982, helping the club achieve promotion to [[Ligue 1]] in 1989.<ref name=7things/> Playing as a [[defensive midfielder]] or [[sweeper (association football)|sweeper]], he became club [[Captain (association football)|captain]]. Garde left Lyon in 1993 to join [[RC Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], where he spent three seasons and reached a [[Coupe de France]] [[1994–95 Coupe de France#Final|final]] in [[1995 Coupe de France Final|1995]]. In the summer, the team won the [[1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup]], defeating Austria's [[Admira Wacker]] in the final.<ref name=fra/>

He moved to England in August 1996, joining [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] after compatriot [[Arsène Wenger]] recommended him to the club; Wenger was not Arsenal's manager at this stage, as he was seeing out his contract at [[Nagoya Grampus]]. Garde joined on the same day as [[Patrick Vieira]],<ref name=7things/> though unlike Vieira, the 30-year-old Garde was intended to be more of an experienced cover player rather than a future first-team regular.<ref name=7things/>

Garde became known for his tidy and reliable performances as backup for Vieira or [[Emmanuel Petit]]; he played a total of 45 matches over three seasons for Arsenal, and was a member of the [[Double (association football)|Double]]-winning side of [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]],<ref name=7things/> making ten league appearances that season meaning he only narrowly qualified for a [[Premier League]] winners' medal. He also made one appearance during Arsenal's [[FA Cup]] run, which came in the quarter-final replay at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref name=7things/> The game went to a penalty shootout and despite Garde missing his kick, Arsenal prevailed.<ref>{{cite news |title=West Ham 1 Arsenal 1 (aet, 3-4 on penalties)|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/article/165/7770613/west-ham-1-arsenal-1-aet-3-4-on-penalties|publisher=Sporting Life |access-date=12 November 2013}}</ref> He was however not part of the squad as they won the [[1998 FA Cup Final]] against [[Newcastle United]] at [[Wembley Stadium]].

With age and a persistent knee injury limiting his appearances, Garde retired from professional football in June 1999, just after he had narrowly missed out on a second successive double with the club, who had finished second in the league and lost the [[1998–99 FA Cup|FA Cup]] [[1998–99 FA Cup#Semi-finals|semi-final]] to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].

==International career==
Garde made his debut for [[France national football team|France]] at the 1990 Kuwait Tournament at the [[Al-Sadaqua Walsalam Stadium]] in [[Kuwait City]]. His first appearance came against [[Kuwait national football team|the hosts]] in a 1–0 win on 21 January. He won six caps for his country, and was a member of the [[UEFA Euro 1992 squads#France|French squad]] at [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 92]] but did not play at all in the competition, in which the French were eliminated at the group stage in Sweden.<ref name=7things>{{cite web | url=http://www.eurosport.co.uk/football/seven-things-you-might-not-know-about-prospective-aston-villa-boss-remi-garde_sto4975335/story.shtml | title=Seven things you might not know about prospective Aston Villa boss Remi Garde | date=2 November 2015 | publisher=Eurosport | access-date=3 November 2015}}</ref>

After a period working as a pundit on [[Television in France|French television]], he rejoined his old club Lyon as a coach in 2003, and helped the club to win Ligue 1 titles in [[2003–04 Ligue 1|2003–04]] and [[2004–05 Ligue 1|2004–05]].<ref name=7things/> After the departure of [[Paul Le Guen]] as manager in the summer of 2005, Garde became assistant to his replacement [[Gérard Houllier]].<ref name=7things/> In May 2007, with his contract due to expire, Garde was linked to a return to Arsenal as [[director of football]], a new role created to replace that of the recently departed [[vice-chairman]] [[David Dein]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Article/Wenger-en-froid-avec-ses-ex/707854|title = Wenger en froid avec ses ex}}</ref>

In 2010, he worked as the director of the [[Centre Tola Vologe]], Lyon's training complex. On 22 June 2011, he was appointed as Lyon's new manager to replace [[Claude Puel]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11806/7000101/lyon-turn-to-garde |title=Lyon turn to Garde |publisher=Sky Sports |date=22 June 2011 |access-date=30 October 2015}}</ref>

===Aston Villa===
On 2 November 2015, Garde agreed a three-and-a-half-year deal to become the manager of [[Premier League]] side [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] who were bottom of the table.<ref name="Remi Garde: Aston Villa confirm ex-Lyon boss as manager">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34704734 |title=Remi Garde: Aston Villa confirm ex-Lyon boss as manager |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 November 2015 |access-date=14 January 2016}}</ref> Six days later, in Garde's first match in charge, his new team drew 0–0 with league leaders [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/08/aston-villa-manchester-city-remi-garde-premier-league-report|title= Aston Villa frustrate Manchester City as Rémi Garde makes instant impact|date=8 November 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|access-date=10 November 2015}}</ref>

Garde put a strong emphasis on discipline at Villa. He dropped midfielder [[Jack Grealish]] from the first team after he went partying following a 4–0 loss at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and warned the team not to party excessively over the [[Christmas]] period.<ref>{{cite news|title=Aston Villa boss Remi Garde: Christmas not a party time for us|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/aston-villa/story/2738995/remi-garde-christmas-not-party-time-for-aston-villa|access-date=30 December 2015|publisher=ESPN FC|date=4 December 2015}}</ref> On 29 March 2016, with Villa still bottom of the league, Garde left the club by mutual consent.<ref>{{cite news|title=Club statement: Rémi Garde|url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~5455200,00.html|access-date=29 March 2016|publisher=Aston Villa F.C.|date=29 March 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330164710/http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10265~5455200%2C00.html|archive-date=30 March 2016}}</ref>
