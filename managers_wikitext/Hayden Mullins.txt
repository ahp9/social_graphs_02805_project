'''Hayden Ian Mullins''' (born 27 March 1979) is an English former professional [[Association football|footballer]] and current [[Manager (association football)|manager]]. He played primarily as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]], but he also played as a [[Defender (association football)#Sweeper (libero)|sweeper]] and at [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right-back]]. He is the U21 Head Coach at [[Fulham F.C. Academy|Fulham]].

Mullins began his career with [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in 1996, and signed his first professional contract with the club in 1998. He quickly established himself in the first team, and made 257 senior appearances for Palace in five seasons. In October 2003, he switched to First Division side [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], initially on a short-term loan, which quickly turned into a permanent transfer. He remained at the club for five and a half years, making 213 appearances, before joining [[Premier League]] side [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in January 2009. He made 129 appearances for Portsmouth, but the club's financial difficulties meant that he joined Championship side [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] on loan in March 2012. At the end of the [[2011–12 Portsmouth F.C. season|2011–12 season]], Mullins left Portsmouth, and joined [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on a free transfer. After two years, during which he also spent time on loan at [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], Birmingham confirmed he would be released when his contract expired at the end of the [[2013–14 Birmingham City F.C. season|2013–14 season]].<!-- which is on 30 June for Football League contracts -->

Mullins made three appearances for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] squad in 1999. After retiring, he became under-23 manager of Watford in 2016, and was twice their [[interim manager]].

==Playing career==
===Crystal Palace===

He took a lot of time with us on the training pitch. He taught us a lot about shape and formation, he's very detailed in that respect. He's very good man on man, he made me feel totally comfortable he didn't pressure me into it at all."<ref name="On the spot" />

Financial difficulties meant that Crystal Palace were unable to make new signings for the [[1999–2000 Crystal Palace F.C. season|1999–2000 season]] and relied on youngsters such as Mullins and [[Clinton Morrison]] and veterans such as [[Andy Linighan]] as they successfully battled against relegation from the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Coppell pulls off Palace miracle |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 June 2000 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/791049.stm |access-date=8 September 2007}}</ref> Mullins made 49 league and cup appearances in that season and a further 51 appearances in the [[2000–01 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2000–01 season]] as Palace reached the [[2000–01 Football League Cup#Semi-finals|semi-final]] of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]], but narrowly escaped relegation.<ref name=cpfc/><ref>{{cite news |title=Red-hot Liverpool steam through |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 January 2001 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/1134428.stm |access-date=5 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Palace survive at Stockport |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 May 2001 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/1311009.stm |access-date=5 September 2012}}</ref> He was transfer listed in October 2000, due to what manager [[Alan Smith (football manager)|Alan Smith]] described as a "bad attitude", but was taken off the list and was offered and signed a new four-year contract two months later as his relationship with Smith improved.<ref>{{cite news |first=Leo |last=Spall |title=Palace gem Mullins regains his sparkle |work=Evening Standard |date=19 December 2000 |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/palace-gem-mullins-regains-his-sparkle-6357298.html |access-date=17 October 2013}}</ref> Smith said of him in January 2001, "He's a really good footballer which means I can play him in any position.

An offer of £600,000 from Birmingham City in January 2003 was rejected as "derisory". With one year remaining on his existing contract, Mullins turned down the offer of a new contract in May. His agent said, "It is no secret that Hayden believes he will not be able to fulfil his true potential at Palace. If the club wishes to get some financial reward for their role in his up bringing, then they need to sell him this summer."<ref name=contract>{{cite news |title =Mullins on his way out |work=Croydon Guardian |date=28 May 2003 |url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/sport/301073.mullins_on_his_way_out/ |access-date=17 October 2013}}</ref> The following October, he joined [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref name=whufc>{{cite news |title=Pardew makes Mullins swoop |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 October 2003 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/3204589.stm |access-date=8 September 2007}}</ref> Mullins made over 250 league and cup appearances for Palace, scoring 20 goals.<ref name=cpfc/>

===West Ham United===
[[File:Hayden mullins.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Mullins playing for West Ham United in November 2006]]

[He] can play in various positions and give us cover in a number of those [...] I think ultimately he is a central midfield player for us and I think his energy will be important; he will have to battle in the midfield. He is someone we are going to look to when we are up against it, to win the battle and give the room to [other players] to play. He is very much a destroyer and I think we are desperate for one of those."<ref name=whufc />

Mullins made 34 league and cup appearances in his [[2003–04 West Ham United F.C. season|first season]] for West Ham, helping them to the [[2004 Football League First Division play-off final|First Division play-off final]] in May 2004, where they were beaten by a single goal to nil by Mullins' former club Crystal Palace.<ref name=sb0304/><ref>{{cite news |title=Crystal Palace 1–0 West Ham |publisher =BBC Sport |date=29 May 2004 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/3750773.stm |access-date=8 September 2007}}</ref> The [[2004–05 West Ham United F.C. season|following season]], Mullins made 45 league and cup appearances as West Ham again reached the [[2005 Football League Championship play-off final|play-off final]], this time beating [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] 1–0 to win promotion to the [[Premier League]].<ref name=sb0405/><ref>{{cite news |title=West Ham 1–0 Preston |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 May 2005 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/4573799.stm |access-date=8 September 2007}}</ref>

West Ham exceeded expectations in the [[2005–06 West Ham United F.C. season|2005–06 season]], finishing in a mid-table position and reaching the [[2006 FA Cup final|FA Cup final]], which was won by Liverpool 3–1 on penalties.<ref>{{cite web |first=Stuart |last=Mawhinney |title=Reds in seventh heaven |publisher=The Football Association |date=13 May 2006 |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/2009/FACF06_MatchReport |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110606081833/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/2009/FACF06_MatchReport |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 June 2011 }}</ref> Mullins, having made 42 appearances in that season, was suspended for the final along with Liverpool's [[Luis García (footballer, born 1978)|Luis García]], after the pair had been sent off in a league fixture a few weeks earlier and an appeal against his dismissal was rejected by [[the Football Association]].<ref name=sb0506/><ref name=xfinal>{{cite news |title=Mullins & Garcia out of Cup final |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 April 2006 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/4949444.stm |access-date=8 September 2007}}</ref> Pardew said, "I feel very aggrieved and very upset because Hayden has had a fantastic season.
