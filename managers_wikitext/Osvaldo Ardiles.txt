'''Osvaldo César Ardiles''' (born 3 August 1952), more commonly known as '''Ossie Ardiles''',<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/feb/13/1 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Ossie Ardiles | first=Nicky | last=Bandini | date=13 February 2009 | access-date=20 May 2010}}</ref> is an Argentine [[Association football|football]] [[coach (sport)|manager]], [[pundit]] and former player.

A competitive and skilled [[midfielder]], Ardiles became a cult hero in England, along with [[Glenn Hoddle]] and compatriot [[Ricardo Villa]], as a player for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. He left England for a period on loan as a result of the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]] in 1982, thus missing most of the 1982–83 English season. He won the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] as part of the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]].

After retirement, Ardiles began his management career in England, coaching [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], before returning to Tottenham to become the first [[Premier League]] manager from Argentina.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/premier-league/2015-2016/the-rise-and-fall-of-british-or-irish-managers-in-the-premier-league_sto4938537/story.shtml|title=The rise and fall of British or Irish managers in the Premier League|date=5 October 2015|work=Eurosport}}</ref> As manager of ''Spurs'' in the mid-1990s, he played several matches utilizing a formation that had five forwards,{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} a formation that had not been used in English football since the 1900s.

During his career, Ardiles has also coached in Mexico, Croatia, Japan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Israel, Paraguay and his native Argentina. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], he is a pundit for [[RTÉ Sport]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/soccer/2010/0601/1224271637051.html | newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] | title=Ardiles joins Bill and the Boys | date=1 June 2010 | access-date=1 June 2010}}</ref>

==Club career==
Ardiles was born in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]],<ref name=BDFutbol/> and played for [[Instituto Atlético Central Córdoba|Instituto de Córdoba]] from a young age.<ref>{{harvnb|Ardiles|2009|p=8}}</ref> As a youngster, Ardiles played football in the streets and was given the nickname ''Pitón'' (python) by his brother because of his snake-like [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skills.<ref name="FourFourTwo">{{Cite news | last = Allen | first = Matt | title = Ossie Ardiles | periodical = FourFourTwo; One-on-One | publisher = [[Haymarket Group]] | pages=12–16 |date=April 2008 }}</ref> He was named as ''[[El Gráfico (Argentina)|El Gráfico]]''{{'}}s best player of the interior in 1974, and abandoned his law degree studies in order to play professional football.<ref>{{harvnb|Ardiles|2009|p=13}}</ref>

He also played for [[Club Atlético Belgrano]] and [[Club Atlético Huracán|Huracán]]. After the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] he moved to England to play for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] where he spent ten seasons.

He helped Tottenham win the [[FA Cup]] in his third season there ([[1980–81 in English football|1980–81]]), and collaborated with pop duo [[Chas & Dave]] as well as the rest of the Tottenham players for a song, "[[Ossie's Dream (Spurs Are On Their Way To Wembley)|Ossie's Dream]]". He played a big part in another FA Cup triumph the following year, but did not play in the final because it had already been arranged with Spurs’ management that he would leave early to join up with [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]'s [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] squad.

In the wake of the [[Falklands War]] between Britain and Argentina it became difficult for him to return to White Hart Lane and he went on loan to [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] in France. After one season in Paris, he returned to Tottenham, helping the club to win the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in 1984 (coming on as a substitute in the second leg of the [[1984 UEFA Cup Final|final]]). In the autumn of 1987, he was caretaker coach under caretaker manager [[Doug Livermore]] of Tottenham between the resignation of [[David Pleat]] and the appointment of [[Terry Venables]].<ref>''Note:'' Ardiles asserts in his autobiography that he was caretaker manager between Pleat and Venables. This is incorrect. See [[List of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. managers]] and references there.</ref> Ardiles left Spurs in 1988.
He then played for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], before being appointed as manager of Swindon Town in July 1989. He played part of the [[1989 American Soccer League]] season with the [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (1988–94)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]].

On 7 February 2008, Ardiles, along with his fellow countryman [[Ricardo Villa]], was inducted into the Tottenham Hotspur Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/articles/halloffame080108.html |title=Hall of Fame|publisher=Tottenhamhotspur.com |access-date=29 June 2010}}</ref>

==International career==
Ardiles was called up to the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] senior team by manager [[César Luis Menotti]] in 1975. He was a member of the World Cup winning squad in 1978.<ref>{{harvnb|Ardiles|2009|p=6}}</ref> At the 1982 World Cup he wore the [[Squad number (association football)|number 1 shirt]], as Argentina's policy at the time was to number their players alphabetically by surname, with an exception made so [[Diego Maradona]] could wear his preferred number 10.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/storie/12-08-2017/88-buffon-44gatti-1-ardiles-storia-numeri-pazzi/centrocampista-numero-1.shtml|title=L'88 di Buffon, il "44Gatti" e l'1 di Ardiles: storia dei numeri pazzi|newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=it|first=Martina|last=Mazzaro|date=13 August 2017|access-date=23 August 2017}}</ref>

== Management career ==
[[File:Oswaldo Ardiles.jpg|thumb|170px|Ardiles in 2006]]
In July 1989, Ardiles moved into football management with second division [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] when [[Lou Macari]] resigned to join [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] in July 1989. He wowed fans by replacing the long ball style which had been so successful with a new "Samba style", which saw the Town playing attacking football. Part of this change was the new "diamond formation" which Ardiles implemented: a [[Formation (association football)#4–4–2|4–4–2]] style with left-sided, right-sided, attacking and defensive midfielders.

Ten months after he had joined, Ardiles led Swindon to their highest ever league position, finishing fourth in the second division. After beating Blackburn in the first leg of the play-off semi-final, the fans paid tribute with a tickertape reception in the second leg. Swindon went on to win promotion to the top flight for the first time in their history—beating [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the Play-off final—only to have the promotion taken from them ten days later, when the Football League demoted them for irregular payments to players.

The following season, Ardiles was told to sell players to keep the club alive and [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] hero [[Alan McLoughlin]] was the first big-money departure. With Swindon rocked by their pre-season troubles, their form deserted them. By the end of February, relegation threatened, and when [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] offered Ardiles the chance to become their new boss, he accepted, becoming the club's first foreign manager. But his time on Tyneside was not a success and he lasted 12 months in the job before being sacked, with the Magpies bottom of the second division, though they achieved safety under his successor [[Kevin Keegan]].

In June 1992, Ardiles replaced [[Bobby Gould]] as manager of [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], who had just missed out on the third division playoffs in 1991–92. At the end of the 1992–93 season, Ardiles guided Albion to victory over [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in the Division Two playoff final. Shortly afterwards he walked out of the Hawthorns to return his former club Tottenham as manager, but his management spell was nowhere near as successful as his spell as a player. Tottenham finished 15th in the Premiership and despite the expensive acquisition of [[Jürgen Klinsmann]] and [[Ilie Dumitrescu]] in the 1994 close season, Ardiles was sacked in October 1994 with Tottenham languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League. They had just been punished for financial irregularities committed during the late 1980s: with a 1-year [[FA Cup]] ban, £600,000 fine and 12 league points deducted. The punishment was later amended to a £1.5million fine and six points deducted but the FA Cup ban and points deduction were later quashed.

Ardiles became coach of [[J. League Division 1]] side [[Yokohama F. Marinos]] in January 2000, but was sacked in June 2001, following a poor start to the season.<ref>{{cite news | title = Ardiles axed as Yokohama coach | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1366135.stm | work = BBC Sport | date = 2 June 2001| access-date = 19 January 2008}}</ref> From 2003 to 2005 he coached [[Tokyo Verdy]], with whom he won the [[2004 Emperor's Cup]], In July 2005 Ardiles was fired after a nine-game winless streak.<ref>{{cite news | title = Ardiles sacked by Japanese side | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4695923.stm | work = BBC Sport | date = 19 July 2005 | access-date = 19 January 2008}}</ref> In mid-2006, he moved to Israel to coach [[Beitar Jerusalem F.C.|Beitar Jerusalem]], though he quit after only a few months in charge on 18 October 2006, due to severe differences of opinion with the club's board of directors. After a short break he was appointed [[Club Atlético Huracán]] manager, in his native Argentina, in September 2007; he steered the club to 7th in the table before resigning at the end of the [[2007–08 in Argentine football|Apertura 2007]].

He joined Paraguayan club [[Cerro Porteño]] in May 2008<ref>[http://www.geofutbol.com/2008/04/29/osvaldo-ardiles-dirigira-a-cerro-porteno/ Osvaldo Ardiles will lead to Cerro Porteño] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203161124/http://www.geofutbol.com/2008/04/29/osvaldo-ardiles-dirigira-a-cerro-porteno/ |date=3 December 2008 }}</ref> but was sacked in August of the same year after a string of poor results and was replaced by [[Pedro Troglio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1700/paraguay/2008/08/12/816095/cerro-porteno-fire-ossie-ardiles|title=Cerro Porteno Fire Ossie Ardiles {{!}} Goal.com|website=www.goal.com|language=en|access-date=11 December 2018}}</ref>

Ardiles played Carlos Rey in the 1981 [[World War II]] film ''[[Escape to Victory]]''.

==Personal life==
He married fellow Argentine Silvia Navarro in December 1973.<ref>{{harvnb|Ardiles|2009|p=12}}</ref> Ardiles' cousin, José, was shot down and killed while piloting an [[IAI Dagger]], the [[Israel|Israeli]] version of the [[Dassault Mirage 5|Mirage 5]], by [[Sea Harrier]] XZ455 on 1 May 1982 during one of the first air engagements of the [[Falklands War]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Domeneghetti |first1=Roger |title=Everybody Wants To Rule The World: Britain, Sport and the 1980s |date=4 May 2023 |publisher=[[Yellow Jersey Press]] |isbn=9781787290594 |page=226}}</ref>
