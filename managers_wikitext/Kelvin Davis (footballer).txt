==Club career==
===Early career===
Davis was born in [[Bedford]], Bedfordshire and started his career as a trainee with [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], turning professional in July 1994. He joined [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] on loan in September 1994 as cover for the injured [[Ashley Bayes]], making his debut in the 3–3 draw at home to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] on 17 September.<ref>{{cite book|title=The definitive Torquay United F.C.|author=Leigh Edwards|date=March 1997|publisher=The Association of Football Statisticians|page=73|isbn=1-899468-09-9}}</ref> He also played in the 2–1 defeat at home to [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] the following week before returning to Luton. He had a further loan spell, with [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] in August 1997. He joined [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in July 1999 for a fee of £600,000.

===Ipswich Town===
Davis joined [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] on a free transfer in July 2003,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/3105929.stm|title=Ipswich land Davis|date=29 July 2003|access-date=4 January 2009 | work=BBC Sport}}</ref> He quickly became the first-choice goalkeeper at Ipswich, making 45 appearances during his first season at the club. He kept his place in the team the following season. His form during the season earned him a place of the [[PFA Team of the Year (2000s)#Championship|2004–05 PFA Championship Team of the Year]],<ref name="0405PFA"/> whilst also helping steer Ipswich to third in the table.<ref name="KD04">{{soccerbase season|1957|2004|access-date=19 June 2020}}</ref>

===Sunderland===
Davis joined [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in June 2005 for a fee of £1.25&nbsp;million,<ref name="bbc0605">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/4586385.stm|title=Davis completes Sunderland move|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=14 June 2005|access-date=4 January 2009}}</ref> and played in most of their [[Premier League]] games in the [[2005–06 FA Premier League|2005–06]] season, as Sunderland were relegated.

===Southampton===
In an attempt to rebuild his career after his difficult spell at Sunderland, Davis joined [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in July 2006 for a fee reported to be around £2 million. He linked up with former goalkeeping coach [[Malcolm Webster (footballer)|Malcolm Webster]], who coached him during his spell at Ipswich. At Southampton, he was first choice goalkeeper for most of the [[The Football League 2006–07|2006–07]] season until a three-match ban relegated him to the bench where he remained after the return of [[Bartosz Białkowski]]. He was suspended for three games after kicking out at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]'s striker [[Jon Parkin]] on 10 March 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/southampton/6456223.stm|title=Davis fails to overturn FA charge|publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 March 2007|access-date=4 January 2009}}</ref>

His form for Saints in the first half of the 2008–09 season was impressive, despite the club's poor form. Southampton fans voted Davis player of the month three times in the first five months of the season on the club's official website.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
