'''Steven Peter Davis''' (born 26 July 1965) is an English [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former professional [[association football|footballer]] who is currently a trainer scout for [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].

As a defender, he played over 100 league games at each of three clubs: [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]], [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. After managing [[Cheshire]]-based non-league teams [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]] and [[Nantwich Town F.C.|Nantwich Town]], he was appointed assistant manager at Crewe Alexandra in 2009. Two years later, in November 2011, he was appointed Crewe manager, winning a Wembley play-off final in 2012 and the [[EFL Trophy]] in 2013. He left Crewe in January 2017 (at which date he was the fourth longest serving manager in the top four divisions of [[English football league system|English football]]) and then head coach at [[National League (division)|National League]] club [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] for just over four months to November 2017. He later joined Wolves as under-18s coach. In October 2022 he became interim manager of Wolves' first team ahead of [[Julen Lopetegui]] taking charge from 14 November 2022.

==Club career==
Born in [[Birmingham]], Davis started his career with [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] as an apprentice<ref name=Hugman2000-01/> in 1982 but never made a senior appearance. However, he played more than 140 matches for both [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] and [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], making his Crewe debut at the age of 18, and captaining the team aged 19. He was also a key figure in the time he was at Burnley. He then played over 100 matches for [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] in Division 1, including 24 appearances in the season in which they were promoted to the Premier League.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=1962&season_id=126 |title=Games played by Steve Davis in 1996/1997 |publisher=Soccerbase |access-date=29 October 2018}}</ref> He had loan spells at [[York City F.C.|York City]] and [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], eventually being signed by Division 1 outfit, Oxford United in 1998.

The final years of his playing career saw him in Cheshire with [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]], and with [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]] and [[Nantwich Town F.C.|Nantwich Town]] – where he was player-manager of both clubs.

Davis was [[Cap (sport)|capped]] by the [[England national under-18 football team|England national youth team]].<ref name=Hugman2000-01/>

==Management career==

===Nantwich Town===
However, his managerial career at Nantwich Town was the most successful time in the club's long history, converting a club that had never achieved anything above the North West Counties League to one that was challenging for a Conference spot. He led Nantwich to two promotions in successive seasons<ref>{{Cite book|last=CHATWIN, MICHAEL.|title=ULTIMATE BOOK OF NANTWICH TOWN FOOTBALL CLUB.|date=2020|publisher=EMPIRE|isbn=978-0-9563068-2-1|location=[S.l.]|oclc=1199329275}}</ref> and a [[FA Vase]] victory, just missing out on promotion to the [[National League North|Conference North]] at the end of the 2008–09 season. His abilities attracted the attention of [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]], where he had spent four seasons as a player. On 17 May 2009, it was announced that he would become assistant manager to [[Gudjon Thordarson]] at Crewe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crewechronicle.co.uk/crewe-alex-fc/crewe-alex-fc-news/2009/06/17/steve-davis-will-start-work-at-crewe-alex-on-monday-96135-23904635/|title=Davis Becomes Alex Assistant|date=17 June 2009|newspaper=Crewe Chronicle|access-date=16 June 2009}}</ref>

===Crewe Alexandra===
Davis remained as Thordarson's assistant through the Icelandic's short lived tenure at Gresty Road before the former Stoke City manager was relieved of his role in October 2009. Taking up the vacant manager's role was [[Dario Gradi]], now in his third stint as Crewe manager kept Davis as his assistant manager. Gradi remained in the managerial position at the club until the autumn of 2011 his position was starting to become questioned by the Crewe fans, this was only galvanised further by a 3–0 home defeat to [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] which left the club near the relegation zone.<ref name="JB14Pg22">Hornbrook (2014), p. 22</ref> Although Gradi was still manager of the club, Davis took charge of the next match against [[Oldham Athletic F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in the [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophy]] after the Crewe manager could not attend after feeling unwell.<ref name="JB14Pg23">Hornbrook (2014), p. 23</ref> Although Crewe lost the match 3–1, Davis was appointed the new Crewe manager a couple of days later with Gradi moving to his former role as Technical Director – a role he took following the appointment of Steve Holland as first team coach back in the summer of 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dario Gradi steps down as Crewe Alexandra manager |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/15675372 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 November 2011|access-date=9 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crewealex.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10414~2511452,00.html/|title=Davis To Take Over As First Team Manager|date=10 November 2011|publisher=Crewe Alexandra F.C|access-date=10 November 2011}}</ref>

Promoting coach Neil Baker as his assistant manager,<ref name="JB14Pg30">Hornbrook (2014), p. 30</ref> Davis' first match, officially, as Crewe manager was a home [[FA Cup]] tie to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]]. Although the railwaymen lost the tie 4–1,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/15604783.stm | publisher=BBC Sport | title=Crewe 1–4 Colchester | date=12 November 2011}}</ref> Davis' brief for the remainder season was specific: keep Crewe in the football league.<ref name="JB14Pg30" /> Davis was successful in his target keeping Crewe in the football league and, in a run that saw the club go 16 matches unbeaten, the English manager helped Crewe qualify for the League Two play-offs. Following a 3–2 win over two legs with [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] and a 2–0 win over [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] at Wembley, Davis' team were promoted to League One.<ref name="Cheltenham 0–2 Crewe">{{cite news |first=Emlyn |last=Begley |title=Cheltenham 0–2 Crewe |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18135731 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 May 2012 |access-date=10 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329130851/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18135731 |archive-date=29 March 2014 }}</ref>

Davis had lost two key figures in that season's promotion campaign in the summer with [[Nick Powell]] completing a three million pound transfer to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and captain [[Ashley Westwood (footballer, born 1990)|Ashley Westwood]] for an undisclosed fee to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] but they were replaced by a number of summer signings such as forward [[Mathias Pogba]], defender [[Mark Ellis (footballer, born 1988)|Mark Ellis]] and midfielder [[Abdul Osman]]. Davis successfully secured safety in League One in his first season and also guided his team to a second Wembley appearance this time in the final of the Football League Trophy against Southend. The Railwaymen won the tie 2–0 with goals from [[Luke Murphy (English footballer)|Luke Murphy]] and [[Max Clayton]].<ref name="Crewe 2–0 Southend">{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Osborne |title=Crewe 2–0 Southend |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21986344 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 April 2013 |access-date=10 January 2016}}</ref>

As with the previous summer, Davis lost a key member of his midfield this time in the form of Luke Murphy who left the club for Championship club [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in 2013 for a million pounds. Despite a brief period linking him with the vacant [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] managerial position,<ref name=Wolves>{{cite news|title=Steve Davis: Crewe boss favourite for Wolves job|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22453159|access-date=7 June 2013|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 May 2013}}</ref> Davis remained at the Alex. The 2013–14 season was less successful than Davis' previous seasons, compacted even more after seven first team players were held by [[Devon and Cornwall Police]] for an alleged sexual assault during the team's pre-season training in [[Redruth]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Seven Crewe Alexandra footballers held over sex attack claims|publisher=BBC News|date=7 July 2013|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-23214468|access-date=20 April 2015}}</ref> The players were cleared of all charges in November,<ref>{{cite news|title=No charge for Crewe Alexandra rape suspect footballers|publisher=BBC News|date=22 November 2013|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-25055485|access-date=20 April 2015}}</ref> a few months into the new campaign. Davis described the decision as a "noose being removed from our necks" citing the case as one of the reasons for the team's poor start to the campaign.<ref>{{cite news|first=Belinda|last=Ryan |title=Alex boss speaks out after rape allegation against players is dismissed|url=http://www.crewechronicle.co.uk/news/crewe-south-cheshire-news/crewe-alexandra-boss-speaks-out-6345457|newspaper=Crewe Chronicle|access-date=20 April 2015}}</ref> Further to the sex assault allegations, Davis was also having attitude issues with summer signing [[Anthony Grant (English footballer)|Anthony Grant]] and former [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] youngster [[Brad Inman (footballer)|Brad Inman]] – listing the pair on loan and isolating them from the rest of the squad in training labelling the pair as a "disruption."<ref name=InmanGrantBBC>{{cite news|title=Brad Inman and Anthony Grant available for loan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25089401|access-date=20 April 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=InmanGrantMorse>{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Morse|title=Grant and Inman labelled a 'disruption'|url=http://www.crewechronicle.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/grant-inman-labelled-disruption-manager-6335532|access-date=20 April 2015|newspaper=Crewe Chronicle|date=23 November 2013}}</ref> The pair were later reinstated to the squad and first team duties following an improvement in their attitudes and helped Crewe avoid relegation on the last day of the season with a 2–1 victory over local rivals [[Preston North End]].

The [[2014–15 Crewe Alexandra F.C. season|2014–15 season]] was no better in terms of Crewe's performance. The team lost 10 of their first 12 matches, and eventually finished in 20th position – remaining in League One despite losing the final match of the season, against [[Bradford City F.C.|Bradford City]], because of results in fixtures elsewhere.

The following season started in a similar pattern, with the team winning just two of their first 15 league matches, and crashing out of the FA Cup in the first round, defeated at Gresty Road by non-league [[Eastleigh F.C.|Eastleigh]],<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34685303 Crewe 0–1 Eastleigh], BBC Sport, 7 November 2015.

===Leyton Orient===
On 10 July 2017, Davis was appointed as head coach of newly relegated [[National League (division)|National League]] club [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] on a two-year contract.<ref>{{cite news |title=Leyton Orient: Steve Davis named new head coach on two-year deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40558673 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 July 2017 |access-date=10 July 2017}}</ref> After the club won just five of their 19 league matches, he was sacked on 14 November 2017.<ref name="BBC-14Nov2017">{{cite news|title=Steve Davis: Leyton Orient sack head coach with club 19th in National League|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41981411|access-date=14 November 2017|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 November 2017}}</ref>

After the success for the under-18s squad, and brief caretaker stint for Wolves' first team, the club appointed Davis as Player Pathways Manager to help link the academy players with the first team players. This had proven successful during his time as caretaker manager, with [[Joe Hodge]], [[Hugo Bueno (footballer, born 2002)|Hugo Bueno]] and [[Dexter Lembikisa]] given more first team experience and regular game time. Davis's former assistant manager at under-18s level, James McPike took over as caretaker manager, until a permanent replacement was found.<ref>{{cite news |title=Davis appointed as pathways manager |url=https://www.wolves.co.uk/news/club/20221223-davis-appointed-as-pathways-manager/ |access-date=25 February 2023 |work=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. |date=23 December 2022}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Davis's son [[Harry Davis (footballer, born 1991)|Harry]] was at Crewe Alexandra but now plays for [[AFC Fylde]], and is also a centre-back. He made his professional debut at the end of the 2009–10 season, playing for Crewe against Bradford City.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.crewechronicle.co.uk/crewe-alex-fc/crewe-alex-fc-news/2010/05/12/crewe-alex-family-ties-no-issue-for-debut-boy-harry-davis-96135-26424146/|title=Crewe Alex: Family ties no issue for debut boy Harry Davis|last=Morse|first=Peter|date=12 May 2010|newspaper=Crewe Chronicle|access-date=15 August 2010}}</ref>
