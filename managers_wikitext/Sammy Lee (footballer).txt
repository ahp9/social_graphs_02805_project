'''Samuel Lee''' (born 7 February 1959) is an English professional [[Association football|football]] [[Coach (sport)|coach]] and former [[Association football|footballer]].

Lee played most of his career for hometown club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] during the 1970s and 1980s as a [[midfielder]], and also represented [[England national football team|England]] fourteen times. He also had playing spells at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].

After retiring as a player, Lee joined the coaching staff at Liverpool before joining [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]]'s [[England national football team|England]] set-up in 2001. He became assistant manager to [[Sam Allardyce]] at Bolton Wanderers in 2005, and their manager in 2007. He was then appointed assistant manager to [[Rafael Benítez]] at Liverpool in 2008 before returning to Bolton Wanderers in 2012 as head of academy coaching and development. Lee was appointed assistant coach at Southampton under [[Ronald Koeman]] in 2014 before joining Sam Allardyce's England staff two years later. Lee followed Allardyce to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2017. Lee re-joined Allardyce again at West Brom in December 2020 as an assistant.

==Playing career==
{{BLP sources| section |date = April 2024}}
Born in [[Liverpool]],<ref name="PFA 365"/> Lee rose through the ranks at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] after joining on an apprenticeship in September 1975, making his first team debut on 8 April 1978, as a 6th minute [[substitute (football)|substitute]] for [[David Johnson (footballer born 1951)|David Johnson]]. [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] at [[Anfield]] were the opponents, as Lee managed to find the net in the 56th minute of the 3–2 victory. A year earlier, he had been put in the squad for a [[1976–77 European Cup|European Cup semi-final]] against [[FC Zürich]] and, although he didn't play, manager [[Bob Paisley]] said he would have had no qualms about using him if required.

Lee became a regular from 1980 onwards and, although small in stature, he established a reputation as a sharp-passing and strong-running midfield player who could also hit a decent shot. In the [[1981 Football League Cup Final|1981 League Cup final]], Lee was at the centre of a controversial incident which left opponents [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] feeling slightly cheated. Lee had ventured forwards in an attack and ended up flat out on the turf following a challenge. The West Ham defence pushed out of their area to leave Lee in an [[Offside (association football)|offside]] position but when Liverpool full back [[Alan Kennedy]] scored with a follow-up shot, the goal stood. West Ham did equalise but Liverpool won the replay with Lee in the side.

In [[1980–81 European Cup|that year]]'s European Cup semi-final against [[Bayern Munich]], Lee was unusually asked to do a man-marking job on [[Paul Breitner]], the strong and skilful [[West Germany|West German]] [[West Germany national football team|international]]. Lee did the marking job to perfection and Liverpool went through to the final against [[Real Madrid]], which they won 1–0 with Lee again in the side.

Lee got his first [[Football League First Division|League title]] medal in 1982 and also helped Liverpool retain the League Cup; the same applied in 1983 and 1984, the latter of which was also the year of [[1984 European Cup Final|their fourth European Cup triumph]] – Lee played in every game en route to the final and scored a clinching goal in the first leg of the semi-final at [[Anfield]] against [[FC Dinamo București|Dinamo București]].

[[Bobby Robson]] gave Lee the first of his 14 [[England national football team|England]] caps during this period, where he again scored on his debut in the 3–0 [[1984 UEFA European Championship]] qualifier victory over [[Greece national football team|Greece]], on 17 November 1982.

Injuries took their toll in 1985 and Lee struggled to regain his previous form. With [[Jan Mølby]] in the side, there was no longer a place for him at Liverpool. He left during August 1986, joining [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. Spells at [[CA Osasuna]] (where he reunited with former Liverpool teammate [[Michael Robinson (footballer)|Michael Robinson]]), [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] followed before he retired from playing.

==Coaching career==
Lee's former Liverpool [[Captain (association football)|captain]], [[Graeme Souness]], invited Lee to join his Anfield coaching staff in 1993. He did so with relish and gained respect to the extent that both [[Roy Evans]] and [[Gérard Houllier]] kept him on the payroll after Souness left, gaining promotion from [[Liverpool F.C. reserves|reserve team]] coach to the first team, under Houllier.

Lee became a part-time coach under [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] with England in 2001,<ref>{{cite news

===Bolton Wanderers===
Lee went to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in September 2005, as assistant to [[Sam Allardyce]]. He was offered the role of manager of the [[England national under-21 football team|England U21s]] in July 2006, but turned the move down and also left the senior England set-up.<ref>{{cite news |title = Lee leaves England coaching team|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/5255978.stm|publisher = BBC News|date=8 August 2006|access-date=30 April 2007}}</ref> He was given the affectionate nickname of "Little Sam" in contrast to Allardyce who was known as "Big Sam" by the Bolton Fans.

Allardyce left Bolton in April 2007 and Lee was confirmed as his replacement shortly afterwards.<ref name="bwfc">{{cite web|title=Club statement |url=http://www.bwfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~1145252,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730064916/http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~1145252,00.html|archive-date=30 July 2012|publisher=Bolton Wanderers F.C. official website|date=17 October 2007|access-date=17 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Lee appointed manager of Bolton|url =https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/bolton_wanderers/6606553.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=30 April 2007|access-date=30 April 2007}}</ref> After only winning one league game from eleven matches, he was sacked in October 2007, becoming the second Premier League manager to be sacked in that season.<ref name="bwfc"/> He was known for regularly citing the 'positives' in post-match interviews despite numerous defeats.

In November 2008, upon his return to the [[Reebok Stadium]] for the first time since his departure, Lee stated that he bore no animosity towards the hierarchy at Bolton or their supporters, the Wanderers crowd responded by giving him a round of applause in appreciation of his spells as player and assistant manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7711320.stm|title=Bolton 0–2 Liverpool |date=15 November 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=18 August 2009|first=Phil|last=McNulty}}</ref>
