'''Stuart Pearce''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (born 24 April 1962) is an English professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Association football|player]], who was most recently a first-team coach for [[Premier League]] club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. He was nicknamed "'''Psycho'''" for his unforgiving style of play.

As a player, Pearce played as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] and appeared for [[Wealdstone F.C.|Wealdstone]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in a career that spanned twenty-two years. He is best known for his twelve-year spell at Forest, where he regularly captained the team and became the club's most capped international, making 76 of his 78 appearances for [[England national football team|England]] while with the club and captaining the national side on nine occasions. In 2016, he briefly came out of retirement, signing a one-match deal with Longford, from [[Longford, Gloucestershire|a town in Gloucestershire]], a team dubbed "the worst in Great Britain", in order to support the grassroots game.<ref name=Longford/>

Pearce's managerial career began at Nottingham Forest in a caretaker role, from December 1996 to May 1997. In November 2000, he was assistant coach to [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] in Taylor's only match in charge of England. Following his retirement in 2002, he remained with Manchester City as a coach under [[Kevin Keegan]]. In 2005, he was named caretaker manager and was given the job permanently that summer. In 2007, he was named caretaker manager of the [[England national under-21 football team|England national under-21 team]], guiding them to the semi-finals of the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2007 UEFA Under-21 Championship]]. After being dismissed by City in May 2007, he was given the England U21 job permanently a month later. Under Pearce, the team finished as runners-up in the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2009 UEFA Under-21 Championship]], but failed to make it out of the group stage in the [[2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2013 UEFA Under-21 Championship]]. In addition, Pearce was an assistant coach under [[Fabio Capello]], managed the [[Great Britain men's Olympic football team|Great Britain Olympic football team]] at the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]],<ref>{{cite web|title=FA appoints Team GB Head Coaches|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/NewsAndFeatures/2011/Pearce-Powell-London-2012.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005001024/http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/NewsAndFeatures/2011/Pearce-Powell-London-2012.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 October 2018|publisher=The FA|date=20 October 2011|access-date=9 February 2012}}</ref> and was caretaker manager of England for one game in February 2012. In 2013, he left the U21s, as his contract was not extended by [[the Football Association]]. He returned to Nottingham Forest as manager in July 2014, and initially began the season well, but after a run of poor form, he was dismissed in February 2015. He has since coached at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and at West Ham United.

==Early life==
Born in [[Shepherd's Bush]], London, Pearce is the youngest of four children. He has two brothers, Dennis and Ray, and a sister, Pamela. Dennis was once a member of the far-right [[British National Party]] and was third on the BNP list for [[London (European Parliament constituency)|London]] for the [[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2009 European Parliament election]].<ref name=pearcegu2012>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/feb/27/stuart-pearce-england-caretaker-manager | title=Stuart Pearce a man of contradictions – a country squire with a twist | work=The Guardian | date=27 February 2012 | access-date=10 March 2016 | author=Taylor, Louise}}</ref> Ray was formerly a referee, and in September 1986, was a linesman in a [[1986–87 Football League Cup|League Cup]] match involving his brother.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/24/was-stuart-pearces-brother-the-linesman-for-a-game-that-he-played-in|title=Was Stuart Pearce's brother the linesman for a game that he played in?|work=The Guardian|date=24 May 2017|accessdate=12 December 2021}}</ref> Pearce first attended [[Fryent Primary School]] in [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]], North West London, before attending [[Claremont High School (Kenton)|Claremont High School]] in [[Kenton, London|Kenton]].

==Club career==

===Early career===
Pearce failed a trial at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and then rejected an offer from [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], instead settling into a career in the [[non-league football|non-league]] game with his local side, [[Wealdstone F.C.|Wealdstone]], while training and working as an [[electrician]]. For almost five years, he was the first-choice full-back for the team, then amongst the biggest names of non-league football in the [[National League (English football)|Alliance Premier League]].

===Coventry City===
In 1983, Wealdstone received an unexpected offer of £30,000 (then a very large sum for a semi-professional player) for Pearce from top-flight club [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. ''Sky Blues'' manager [[Bobby Gould]] had been to watch Wealdstone and was impressed by Pearce's determination and combative attitude. Pearce agreed to the step-up in clubs reluctantly&nbsp;– making his professional debut for Coventry immediately. He established himself as an uncompromising left-back who played in a hard but fair manner.

===Nottingham Forest===
Two years later in 1985, Pearce was brought to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] by manager [[Brian Clough]] in a combined deal which also saw Coventry centre-back [[Ian Butterworth]] move to Forest. Despite the transfer, Pearce was still unsure of his prospects in the professional game and even advertised his services as an electrician in Forest's match-day programme.

Pearce spent twelve years at Forest, with the majority of the time as club captain. During his playing career, he won two [[Football League Cup|League Cups]] and the [[Full Members Cup]], while also scoring from a [[Direct free kick|free-kick]] in the [[1991 FA Cup Final|1991 FA Cup final]], when Forest were beaten by [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. In his time at the [[City Ground]], Pearce was one of the Forest players who had to cope with the horrors of the [[Hillsborough disaster]] during the opening minutes of their FA Cup semi-final against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. Pearce played in the rescheduled match at [[Old Trafford]], which Liverpool won 3–1. He helped Forest finish third in the league that year, and also contributed to their victories in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and Full Members Cup. He helped them retain the League Cup a year later and in 1991 the club reached the [[FA Cup]] final. Despite giving Forest an early lead in the final against Tottenham, Pearce ended up on the losing side as Spurs came back to win 2–1. He missed out on a [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] appearance the following season as Forest lost 1–0 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1992 Football League Cup Final|1992 League Cup final]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=42765|title=Sporting Heroes|work= Sporting-Heroes.net|publisher=George Herringshaw}}</ref>

In 1993, Forest were relegated from the Premier League and [[Brian Clough]] resigned after 18 years as manager, but Pearce opted to stay at the [[City Ground]] and captained Forest to an instant return to the top flight as Division One runners-up. In 1994, Pearce was accused of directing a racial slur at [[Paul Ince]] during a Nottingham Forest–Manchester United match. It was alleged Pearce called Ince an "arrogant black cunt".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9073139/FA-expecting-backlash-from-anti-racism-campaigners-after-naming-Stuart-Pearce-as-caretaker-manager.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9073139/FA-expecting-backlash-from-anti-racism-campaigners-after-naming-Stuart-Pearce-as-caretaker-manager.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |work=The Daily Telegraph | title=FA expecting backlash from anti-racism campaigners after naming Stuart Pearce as caretaker manager | date=9 February 2012 | location=London | first=Henry | last=Winter}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Pearce stated he apologised at the time to Ince and later in 2012 said of the racial slur: "It wasn't right or appropriate at the time, or at any time."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/stuart-pearce-regrets-racial-abuse-of-paul-ince-7422606.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220525/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/stuart-pearce-regrets-racial-abuse-of-paul-ince-7422606.html |archive-date=25 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Ben | last=Rumsby | date=23 February 2012|access-date=11 February 2015|title=Stuart Pearce regrets racial abuse of Paul Ince }}</ref> Pearce helped Forest finish third in the Premier League in 1995 and reach the [[UEFA Cup]] quarter-finals in 1996.

In [[1996–97 in English football|1996–97 season]], Forest struggled in the league and manager [[Frank Clark (footballer)|Frank Clark]] resigned in December, which saw 34-year-old Pearce appointed [[caretaker manager|caretaker]] [[player-manager]] of Forest in December 1996. His first match in charge was at home to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the league. He admitted in an interview with ''[[Match of the Day]]'' that, in his first attempt at picking a starting XI, he did not realise until it was pointed out to him by his wife that he had omitted [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Mark Crossley]]. Forest, however, won the match 2–1, coming from behind after an [[Ian Wright]] goal with two goals from [[Alfie Haaland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbot.com/fa/results/ukprem97.htm|title=UK Premier League 1996-1997 |work=Soccerbot}}</ref> Despite winning [[FA Premier League Manager of the Month|Manager of the Month award]] in January 1997, he would later share the caretaker role with [[Dave Bassett]], and Forest were relegated, finishing in bottom place.

Pearce opted to leave the club on a free transfer at the end of the [[1996–97 in English football|1996–97 season]] after 12 years at the City Ground.

===Later career===
Pearce joined [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] along with fellow veterans [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] and [[Ian Rush]] in the 1997–98 season under [[Kenny Dalglish]], and played in the [[1998 FA Cup Final|1998 FA Cup final]], though again he emerged on the defeated side. He scored once during his spell at Newcastle, in a [[UEFA Champions League]] tie against [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-champions-league-newcastle-finish-campaign-in-the-right-vein-1288179.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220525/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-champions-league-newcastle-finish-campaign-in-the-right-vein-1288179.html |archive-date=25 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Newcastle finish campaign in the right vein|publisher=ESI Media|work=The Independent|date=10 December 1997 |access-date=3 November 2009| first=Simon| last=Turnbull}}</ref> Eventually, Pearce was isolated, along with other players including Barnes and [[Rob Lee]], after [[Ruud Gullit]] succeeded Dalglish. A number of players were treated coldly by Gullit, and Pearce along with Barnes and Lee were made to train with the reserves despite cumulatively having over 150 England caps between them. As result Pearce didn't make any first team appearances for Newcastle after December 1998.<ref>{{Soccerbase season|6210|1998|name=Stuart Pearce|access-date=24 June 2024}}</ref> Both Pearce and Barnes assert in their autobiographies Gullit felt threatened by the senior players in the squad, and they felt they were being sidelined to prevent them challenging him for the manager's position should it arise. Pearce claims also that he once kicked Gullit up in the air during a training session, and a number of other players sniggered at this due to Gullit's poor relationship with them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Psycho: The Autobiography |author=Stuart Pearce|id={{ASIN|0747264821|country=uk}} }}</ref>

Pearce went on to play for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], a year after falling out of favour with Gullit. He made his debut on 7 August 1999 in a 1–0 home win against Tottenham Hotspur. His first goal came on 21 October 2000 in a 2–1 home defeat to Arsenal. He made 50 appearances in all competitions, scoring three goals and in 2001 he was named [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|Hammer of the Year]].<ref name=Hoty>{{cite web|title=Stuart Pearce|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&ham=734&united=Stuart_Pearce|work=WestHamStats.info|access-date=18 May 2013}}</ref>

In the summer of 2001, he was [[Kevin Keegan]]'s first signing for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for what would be the final season in his career. He [[Captain (association football)|captained]] the club to the First Division championship and scored direct from a free-kick on his debut, against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. In the final game of his career, against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], he had the chance to reach 100 career goals.<ref>{{cite news| title = Retiring Pearce hunts ton| url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/1939915.stm|publisher=BBC Sport| date = 19 April 2002| access-date =24 February 2008}}</ref> He took a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] for City four minutes into [[injury time]], but missed it along with the chance to reach his target.<ref>{{cite news| title = Pearce left red-faced| url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/1935818.stm|publisher=BBC Sport| date = 21 April 2002| access-date =24 February 2008}}</ref>

===Amateur football===
On 28 January 2016, at the age of 53 and more than thirteen years after retiring, Pearce signed as a player for non-league side Longford, a club from [[Longford, Gloucestershire]]. The club was dubbed as "the worst in the UK" as they lost all their games at that date with a single goal scored and 179 conceded and lying at the bottom of the [[Gloucestershire Northern Senior League]] Division Two, the [[English football league system|13th tier of English football]].<ref name=Longford>{{cite news | title = England legend Stuart Pearce signs for Longford AFC | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-35428976 |publisher=BBC News | date = 28 January 2016 | access-date =28 January 2016}}</ref> On 12 March, Pearce made his debut for Longford as a second-half substitute in a 1–0 loss against Wotton Rovers.<ref>{{cite news | title = Stuart Pearce makes Longford AFC debut as sub | url =  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35794620 |publisher=BBC News | date = 12 March 2016 | access-date = 12 March 2016}}</ref>

==Style of play==
Throughout his career, Pearce was given the nickname of "Psycho" for his unforgiving style of play. This was initially a tag afforded to him only by Forest fans, though later it was adopted by England supporters as well. Of the nickname, Pearce later commented:

{{cquote|The Psycho nickname was just a bit of fun. In the 80s everyone was called Psycho or [[Rambo (franchise)|Rambo]]. It doesn't represent what I'm like away from football. You've got to be a bit more cute than that. If you're an idiot and try to live up to your nickname, you won't last very long. I'd like to think there's a little more about me than that. A lot of journalists were pigeonholing me as a lunatic who shouldn't represent England because I'd get sent off all the time. But in 78 games for England I've been booked five times and never been sent off. I've only been sent off three times playing for my club, which in this day and age is quite an achievement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/aug/28/artsfeatures.biography|title=Twenty years of hurt|work=The Guardian|first=Stephen|last=Moss|date=28 August 2000|accessdate=12 December 2021}}</ref>}}

[[Roy Keane]], who played with Pearce from 1990 to 1993, is quoted as saying that Pearce was "a man amongst boys" at Forest.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coller|first=Mark|title=These Forest Men|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vk0sCQAAQBAJ|isbn=978-1291347333|page=283|date=5 August 2013|publisher=Lulu.com }}</ref> Former England teammate [[Matt Le Tissier]] has since described him as his scariest opponent in his autobiography, ''Taking Le Tiss''.

Pearce was also well known for his prowess from [[Set piece (football)|set pieces]], being a designated [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]]-taker for club and country. As a specialist at [[free kick (association football)|direct free kicks]], renowned for his powerful left foot, Pearce scored from several of the free kicks that he took, famously including the first goal in the [[1991 FA Cup Final|1991 FA Cup final]] against Tottenham.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://thesetpieces.com/latest-posts/90s-heroes-stuart-pearce/ | title='90s Heroes: Stuart Pearce | date=9 November 2016 }}</ref> He was also a notable attacking threat going forward and a good crosser of the ball.

==International career==
Pearce made his debut for [[England national football team|England]] against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in a 1–1 friendly draw at Wembley on 19 May 1987 at age 25.<ref name="eol">{{Englandstats|ref=y|access-date=4 April 2014}}</ref> Replacing [[Kenny Sansom]] as the first choice left-back for his country, injury prevented him from playing in the [[UEFA Euro 1988|1988 UEFA European Championship]]. Following the tournament, he was consistently picked as left-back and scored his first England goal in his 21st senior appearance for England on 25 April 1990, scoring in a 4–2 friendly win over [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] at Wembley.<ref name=eol/>

Pearce played at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], setting up a goal for [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]] in the quarter-final win against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] and operating as a more attacking left-back than normal as England deployed a sweeper system.<ref name="wcy">{{cite web | url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1990/qf_cmr_v_eng.html| title=World Cup 1990| publisher=www.planetworldcup.com | access-date=4 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/cmpwc/CmpWC1990Squad.html | title=England in Italy 1990 | publisher=www.englandfootballonline.com | access-date=4 April 2014}}</ref> England progressed to the semi-finals, and Pearce was one of two players (the other being [[Chris Waddle]]) to miss a penalty in the [[penalty shootout (football)|shoot-out]] against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] after the match had ended in a 1–1 draw. Pearce left the field in tears.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jun/27/stuart-pearce-england-germany-under-21s | title=Stuart Pearce unfazed by challenge of familiar foes Germany in U21 final | work=The Guardian | date=28 June 2009 | access-date=4 April 2014 | author=Hytner, David}}</ref>

The following summer, on 8 June 1991, Pearce scored his second England goal in a 2–0 win over [[New Zealand men's national football team|New Zealand]] during the England side's tour of Oceania. This game was his 40th appearance for England.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/|title=Football photographic encyclopedia, footballer, world cup, champions league, football championship, olympic games & hero images by sporting-heroes.net|website=www.sporting-heroes.net}}</ref>

The [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] games had been England's first competitive matches since the end of the World Cup qualifiers nearly three years earlier. They had not been required to qualify for the tournament due to being hosts. All of the matches played between November 1993 and June 1996 had been friendlies, including the clash with [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] on 15 November 1995 in which Pearce scored the last of his five goals for England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfc.com/Profiles/php/PlayerProfileByName.php|title=Player Profile<!-- Bot generated title -->|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716164734/http://www.englandfc.com/Profiles/php/PlayerProfileByName.php|archive-date=16 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> When [[Terry Venables]] became England coach later in 1994, Pearce lost his place to [[Graeme Le Saux]], but then regained it after Le Saux suffered a broken leg in December 1995. Pearce stayed in the side into Euro 96, scoring a penalty in a quarter-final shoot-out against [[Spain national football team|Spain]], which England won. His impassioned reaction following his successful penalty in front of the celebrating Wembley crowd became one of the images of the tournament.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/10/remembering-euro-96-gazzas-goal-three-lions-and-penalties-england | title=Remembering Euro 96: Gazza's goal, Three Lions ... and penalties | work=The Guardian | date=10 May 2020 | access-date=26 August 2020 | author=Simon Burnton}}</ref> He also scored in the semi-final shoot-out against Germany, but Germany again won after [[Gareth Southgate]] missed his spot-kick.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.uefa.com/under21/news/0254-0d7da3b618cb-de0b71254a0e-1000--stuart-pearce/ | title=Stuart Pearce | work=[[UEFA]] | access-date=4 April 2014}}</ref>

Pearce was not selected for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] by new coach [[Glenn Hoddle]], but the appointment of [[Kevin Keegan]] as Hoddle's replacement and Pearce's form for West Ham prompted a recall for the 37-year-old for two qualifying games for [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]]. Pearce's broken leg later put paid to further international chances and he ended his international career in 1999 with 78 caps, which for a time put him in the all-time top ten for England appearances. Pearce's last appearance for England was in a goalless draw in [[Poland national football team|Poland]] on 8 September 1999 in the [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]] qualifiers. At 37 years and 137 days, he was the third-oldest outfield player ever to appear for England (only [[Stanley Matthews]] and [[Leslie Compton]], plus five goalkeepers, have been older).

During his one match tenure, [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] appointed Pearce as [[Assistant coach|assistant manager]]. England played, and lost to, [[Italy national football team|Italy]] away in [[Turin]].

==Coaching career==

===Manchester City===
[[File:Manchester City-Liverpool--Pearce and Benitez.jpg|thumb|right|181px|Stuart Pearce managing [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] against [[Rafael Benítez]]'s [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 2007.]]

After ending his playing career with Manchester City, he remained at the club as a coach under manager Kevin Keegan. In March 2005, less than three years after retiring, he was appointed caretaker of City after Keegan left the club.<ref>{{cite news| title = Keegan ends his reign at Man City| url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/4338665.stm|publisher=BBC Sport| date = 11 March 2005| access-date =24 February 2008}}</ref> His first win was against Liverpool, on 9 April 2005, as [[Kiki Musampa]] scored the goal in injury time with a firm volley past [[Scott Carson]]. After a successful run of form, which put the club close to UEFA Cup qualification, Pearce was given the job on a permanent basis.<ref>{{cite news| title = Man City unveil Pearce as manager| url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/4503717.stm|publisher=BBC Sport| date = 12 May 2005| access-date =24 February 2008}}</ref> However, they missed the opportunity to reach Europe on the final game of the season by drawing 1–1 with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. [[Robbie Fowler]] missed a penalty in the last minute which, if it had gone in, would have given City a UEFA Cup place.

Despite a successful start to the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06 season]], City finished 15th in the Premier League due to losing nine of the last ten games. They were also eliminated from the League Cup by [[Football League One|League One]] side [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]. Pearce developed the reputation as being unusually fair and honest by refusing to criticise referees for mistakes they may have made.<ref name="OKref">[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchestercity/s/229/229965_pearce_backs_ref_over_penalty_claim.html Manchester Evening News&nbsp;– Pearce backs ref over penalty claim] Accessed 21 December 2006 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200408172636/http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchestercity/s/229/229965_pearce_backs_ref_over_penalty_claim.html |date=8 April 2020 }}</ref> He was also touted as a potential successor for England manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]].<ref>{{cite news| title = Butcher backs Pearce for England| url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4836044.stm|publisher=BBC Sport| date = 23 March 2006| access-date =23 February 2008}}</ref>

Pearce failed to bring about an improvement in the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07 season]] which saw City come close to relegation.<ref>{{cite news| title = Hughes defends under-fire Pearce| url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/6441009.stm|publisher=BBC Sport| date = 12 March 2007| access-date =23 February 2008}}</ref> The club were again eliminated from the League Cup by a League One team, this time by [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].

Under his guidance, England reached the semi-finals of the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2007 UEFA Under-21 Championships]] but were eliminated on penalties by the hosts, the [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|Netherlands]].

In June 2009, Pearce guided the under-21s to the final of the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2009 UEFA Under-21 Championship]], where they lost 4–0 to [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8122457.stm|title=Germany U21 4–0 England U21 |date=29 June 2009|publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=29 June 2009 | first=David | last=McIntyre}}</ref> He was also manager of the U21 team which reached the [[2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2013 UEFA Under-21 Championship]] in Israel, where they were eliminated after losing all their group matches.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22830053 | title=Stuart Pearce critical of England Under-21 players following exit | publisher=BBC Sport | date=8 June 2013 | access-date=9 June 2013}}</ref> On 19 June 2013, it was announced by [[The Football Association|the FA]] that his contract would not be extended.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22956762 | title= Stuart Pearce: England Under-21 boss to leave role | publisher=BBC Sport | date=19 June 2013 | access-date=19 June 2013}}</ref>
