'''Thomas Frank''' ({{IPA|da|ˈtsʰʌmæs ˈfʁɑŋk}}; born 9 October 1973) is a Danish professional [[association football|football]] [[Manager (association football)|manager]] who is the head coach of [[Premier League]] club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].

After 18 years in youth coaching, which included spells as manager of multiple [[Denmark national football team|Danish national youth team]]s, Frank became a senior manager with [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] in 2013. After his departure in 2016, he moved to English club [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] as assistant head coach, and was promoted into the role of head coach in October 2018. At the end of the [[2020–21 Brentford F.C. season|2020–21]] season, Frank became only the second Brentford head coach or manager to achieve promotion to the top-flight of English football. 

Over the following four seasons, Frank guided Brentford into becoming a mainstay in the Premier League, on a limited budget. In June 2025, Frank departed from Brentford after seven years at the club to join Tottenham Hotspur.
