'''Alan Thomas Curtis''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MBE}} (born 16 April 1954) is a former [[Wales national football team|Wales]] international [[Association football|footballer]], who played as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]]; he is currently the honorary club president of [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47951905 |title=Swansea City: Alan Curtis retires from coaching and becomes club president |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 April 2019 |access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>

He began his career with [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in 1972, and spent the next seven years with the "Swans", winning promotion out of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1977–78 and out of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in 1978–79. He was then sold on to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], but struggled in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and was sold back to Swansea in 1980. He helped Swansea to win promotion out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1980–81, but a period of decline for the club followed and he moved on to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in November 1983. He played on loan at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] towards the end of the 1985–86 season, before he joined [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in the summer. He helped the "Bluebirds" to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1987–88 and to also win the [[1987–88 Welsh Cup]]. He made another return to Swansea during the 1989–90 campaign, and later ended his career with [[Barry Town F.C.|Barry Town]], winning the [[Welsh Cup]] in 1994.

During his career he also represented Wales, scoring six goals in 35 international games. After retiring as a player he spent many years on the backroom staff at Swansea City, and has had several spells as a caretaker-manager.

==Club career==

===Swansea City===
He was born in [[Pentre]], [[Rhondda]] on 16 April 1954 to Tydfil and Albert Curtis, a factory worker and coal miner respectively.<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|Johnson|Sprake|2009|p=14}}</ref> His uncle, [[Roy Paul]], was a [[Wales national football team|Wales]] international footballer.<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|Johnson|Sprake|2009|p=17}}</ref> He had an unsuccessful trial at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as a 13-year-old.<ref name="page 41">{{harvnb|Curtis|Johnson|Sprake|2009|p=41}}</ref> He represented Rhondda Schools, where he was spotted by [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and offered a trial.<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|Johnson|Sprake|2009|p=28}}</ref> He chose to remain at his local [[Grammar school]] and pass his [[A-level]]s before going to [[Vetch Field]] for a trial in 1972, by which time he had already won a [[Wales national under-18 football team|Wales under-18]] cap.<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|Johnson|Sprake|2009|p=29}}</ref>

Manager [[Roy Bentley]] handed him his debut in [[the Football League]] in a 3–1 defeat to [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] at [[Roots Hall]] in August 1972.<ref name="page 41"/> Though he did not have an extended run in the first team he did end the [[1972–73 Football League|1972–73]] campaign with 14 appearances to his name. The team performed poorly, and a change of manager from Bentley to [[Harry Gregg]] could not prevent City being relegated out of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|Johnson|Sprake|2009|p=47}}</ref>

Despite being retained by Gregg, Curtis had to work as a builder's apprentice during the summer of 1973 to supplement his low income.<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|Johnson|Sprake|2009|p=51}}</ref> Despite the arrival of [[John Charles]] as a coach and [[Herbie Way]]'s promotion to player-coach, Gregg continued the physical style of football favoured by Bentley that did not suit Curtis well.<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|Johnson|Sprake|2009|p=52}}</ref> Regardless of being ill-suited to this approach Curtis established himself as a first-team regular and made 40 appearances in the [[1973–74 Football League|1973–74]] season.<ref name="page 55">{{harvnb|Curtis|Johnson|Sprake|2009|p=55}}</ref> Gregg left Swansea midway through the [[1974–75 Football League|1974–75]] campaign, and new manager [[Harry Griffiths (footballer, born 1931)|Harry Griffiths]] insisted on playing a pass-and-move style of football.<ref name="page 55"/> Initial results were poor, and the club had to apply for re-election after finishing 22nd at the end of the campaign.

Griffiths switched Curtis from his usual outside-left to a centre-forward position during the [[1975–76 Football League|1975–76]] campaign, and the move worked out so well that he remained a striker for the remainder of his career.<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|Johnson|Sprake|2009|p=57}}</ref> He claimed nine goals in 43 games, as Swansea improved to an 11th-place finish. He scored 17 goals in 53 appearances during the [[1976–77 Football League|1976–77]] campaign, but Swansea missed out on promotion after finishing one point behind [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] despite boasting the highest goals tally in the Football League.<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|Johnson|Sprake|2009|p=61}}</ref>

A disappointing start to the [[1977–78 Football League|1977–78]] season cost Griffiths his job, and new appointment [[John Toshack]] managed to take the club to promotion, with Curtis claiming 34 goals in 46 games to become the division's top-scorer that season. On 12 November, Curtis scored a hat-trick during a home win over [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]].<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|Johnson|Sprake|2009|p=62}}</ref> He also claimed a hat-trick in an 8–0 victory over [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]].<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|Johnson|Sprake|2009|p=64}}</ref>

===Leeds United===
After scoring just six goals in 35 matches for Leeds he was released in 1980. While he showed promise when he played, injuries kept him sidelined too often and he was let go by Allan Clarke.

===Return to Swansea===
He moved back to Swansea City and helped them gain promotion to the First Division in [[1980–81 Football League|1980–81]]. He scored in the [[South Wales derby]] on 27 December 1980, in a 3–3 draw with [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] at [[Ninian Park]].

He scored on the opening day of the [[1981–82 Football League|1981–82]] season, as Swansea beat his former club Leeds 5–1.<ref>{{harvnb|Curtis|Johnson|Sprake|2009|p=13}}</ref> The season was a highly successful one for both player and club, as he scored ten goals in 45 appearances to help Swansea to a sixth place league finish.

Swansea had a fine first season in the top-flight finishing in 6th position but back to back relegations saw the club slide back down into the Third Division.

===Southampton===
Curtis joined [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in November 1983 and he spent three seasons at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]] scoring seven goals in 67 appearances. Towards the end of the [[1985–86 Stoke City F.C. season|1985–86]] season Curtis joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on loan playing in three Second Division matches for the Potters.<ref name="Stoke City Modern Era">{{cite book|last=Lowe|first=Simon|title=Stoke City The Modern Era - A Complete Record|year=2000|publisher=Desert Island Books|isbn=1-874287-39-2}}</ref>

===Cardiff City===
He then joined [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] where he spent four seasons helping the club gain promotion in [[1987–88 Football League|1987–88]]. He scored a goal in the 2–0 win over [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] in the [[1987–88 Welsh Cup]] final at [[Vetch Field]].<ref>{{cite web|title=18 May 1988 at the Vetch Field, Swansea|url=http://wfda.co.uk/welshcup_final_detail.php?id=101|website=wfda.co.uk/|access-date=8 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208202404/http://wfda.co.uk/welshcup_final_detail.php?id=101|archive-date=8 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Third spell at Swansea===
He ended his Football League career with a return to Swansea.

===Barry Town===
However, he would experience further playing success in 1994, winning the [[Welsh Cup]] with [[Barry Town F.C.|Barry Town]] at the old [[Cardiff Arms Park|National Stadium]], aged 40.

==International career==
Curtis won one cap for the [[Wales national under-18 football team|Wales under-18]], [[Wales national under-21 football team|under-21]] and [[Wales national under-23 football team|under-23]] teams. He went on to score six goals in 35 international matches for the [[Wales national football team|Wales]] senior team from 1976 to 1987.

==Coaching and managerial career==
Curtis worked in most backroom staff roles at [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], as well as being a part of [[Brian Flynn (footballer)|Brian Flynn]]'s [[Wales national under-21 football team|Wales under-21]] coaching set up.<ref>{{cite news|title=Swansea manager Michael Laudrup adds Alan Curtis to his coaching staff|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/06/swansea-michael-laudrup-alan-curtis|work=The Guardian|access-date=6 March 2013|location=London|date=6 July 2012}}</ref>

He was appointed Swansea's first-team coach by new manager [[Michael Laudrup]] in July 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Alan Curtis in Michael Laudrup's Swansea City backroom team|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18729770|access-date=8 February 2015|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=6 July 2012}}</ref>

Curtis continued his role as first-team coach under manager [[Garry Monk]]. On 9 December 2015, following the dismissal of Monk, he became caretaker manager on a game-by-game basis as the club searched for a new manager. However, on 7 January 2016, it was confirmed that Curtis would continue as manager until the end of the season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Swansea City: Alan Curtis to take charge until end of the season|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35218974|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=7 January 2016|date=7 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Curtis to manage Swans for rest of season as Alan maintains managerial duties for duration of campaign|url=http://www.swanseacity.com/news/article/alan-curtis-swansea-city-premier-league-caretaker-manager-2889097.aspx|publisher=Swansea City AFC|access-date=18 January 2016|date=7 January 2016}}</ref> Despite this, on 18 January, [[Francesco Guidolin]] was brought in as head coach, with Curtis returning to a coaching role at the club.<ref>{{cite web|title=Francesco Guidolin: Swansea City name Italian as new head coach|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/18/swansea-city-appoint-francesco-guidolin-head-coach|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 January 2016|access-date=19 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Pritchard|first1=Dafydd|title=Curtis happy as Guidolin takes reins|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35348848|website=BBC Sport|date= 19 January 2016 |access-date=19 January 2016}}</ref>

Guidolin was sacked on 3 October 2016 and, after a short period with [[Bob Bradley]] in charge, Curtis again served as caretaker-manager before the arrival of [[Paul Clement (football manager)|Paul Clement]] in January 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/30/swansea-stay-up-or-struggle-warning-alan-curtis-caretaker-football |title=Swansea must stay up or face struggle to get back, says Alan Curtis |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=27 January 2017|date=30 December 2016}}</ref>

Curtis became Swansea's first Loan Player Manager in January 2017; he monitored the progress of players out on loan.<ref>{{cite web |title=New role for Swans legend Curtis |url=http://www.swanseacity.com/news/article/2016-17/swansea-city-legend-alan-curtis-loan-player-manager-3505806.aspx |publisher=Swansea City AFC |access-date=6 January 2017|date=6 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38537931 |title=Alan Curtis: Swansea City name club legend as loan player manager |publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=27 January 2017|date=6 January 2017}}</ref>

Curtis was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the [[2021 New Year Honours]] for services to Welsh football.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=63218|supp=y|page=N17|date=31 December 2020}}</ref>
