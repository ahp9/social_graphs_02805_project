Klopp spent most of his playing career at [[1. FSV Mainz 05|Mainz 05]]. He was initially deployed as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]], but was later moved to [[Defender (association football)|defence]]. Upon retiring in 2001, Klopp became the club's manager, and secured [[Bundesliga]] promotion in [[2003–04 2. Bundesliga|2004]]. After suffering relegation in the [[2006–07 Bundesliga|2006–07 season]] and unable to achieve promotion, Klopp resigned in 2008 as the club's longest-serving manager. He then became manager of [[Borussia Dortmund]], guiding them to the Bundesliga title in [[2010–11 Bundesliga|2010–11]], before winning Dortmund's first-ever [[Double (association football)|domestic double]] during a record-breaking season.{{refn|group=note|Klopp's Dortmund scored a then-record number of points and wins in a Bundesliga season in 2011–12; both records were subsequently broken by [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in the 2012–13 season.}} Klopp also guided Dortmund to a runner-up finish in the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League]] before leaving in 2015 as their longest-serving manager.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Borussia Dortmund {{!}} 2012/13 {{!}} Season review |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/0000256992.jsp |access-date=20 June 2024 |website=bundesliga.com - the official Bundesliga website |language=en }}{{Dead link|date=September 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Klopp was appointed manager of Liverpool in 2015. He guided the club to [[UEFA Champions League]] finals in [[2018 UEFA Champions League final|2018]] and [[2022 UEFA Champions League final|2022]], and won the trophy in [[2019 UEFA Champions League final|2019]] to secure his first – and Liverpool's sixth – title in the competition. Klopp's side finished second in the [[2018–19 Premier League]], registering 97 points; the then third-highest total in the history of the English top division, and the most by a team without winning the title. The following season, Klopp won the [[2019 UEFA Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup]] and Liverpool's first [[2019 FIFA Club World Cup|FIFA Club World Cup]], before delivering Liverpool's first [[2019–20 Premier League|Premier League]] title, amassing a club record 99 points and breaking a number of top-flight records. These achievements won him back-to-back [[The Best FIFA Football Coach|FIFA Coach of the Year]] awards in 2019 and 2020. Klopp won a cup double of the [[EFL Cup]] and [[FA Cup]] in [[2021–22 Liverpool F.C. season|2022]]. He won another EFL Cup in [[2023–24 Liverpool F.C. season|2024]], departing that same year.

Klopp is a notable proponent of ''[[Gegenpressing]]'', whereby the team, after losing possession, immediately attempts to win back possession, rather than falling back to regroup. He has described his sides as playing "[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]" football, in reference to their pressing and high attacking output. Klopp has cited his main influences as Italian coach [[Arrigo Sacchi]], and former Mainz coach [[Wolfgang Frank]]. The importance of emotion is something Klopp has underlined throughout his managerial career, and he has gained both admiration and notoriety for his enthusiastic [[touchline]] celebrations.

==Manager profile==
===Tactics===
Klopp is a notable proponent of ''Gegenpressing'', a tactic in which the team immediately attempts to win back possession after losing the ball, rather than falling back to regroup.<ref>{{cite web |date=26 October 2015 |first=Barry |last=Glendenning |title=Football transfer rumours: Pep Guardiola to manage Chelsea? |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/26/football-transfer-rumours-pep-guardiola-to-manage-chelsea |access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jurgen Klopp's tactics: What Dortmund tells us about Liverpool |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/15117/10027207/jurgen-klopp8217s-tactics-what-dortmund-tells-us-about-liverpool |website=Sky Sports |access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref> Klopp has stated that a well-executed counter-pressing system can be more effective than any playmaker when it comes to creating chances.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wright |first1=Nick |title=How the pressing game is powering the Premier League's top clubs |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/10611288/how-the-pressing-game-is-powering-the-premier-leagues-top-clubs |website=Sky Sports |access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref> Commenting on his pressing tactics, Klopp said that "The best moment to win the ball is immediately after your team just lost it. The opponent is still looking for orientation where to pass the ball. He will have taken his eyes off the game to make his tackle or interception and he will have expended energy. Both make him vulnerable".<ref name="The Guardian">{{cite web |last1=Wilson |first1=Jonathan |title=Jürgen Klopp Jürgen Klopp's Liverpool and the importance of 'gegenpressing' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/oct/16/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-gegenpressing-borussia-dortmund |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 October 2015 |access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref> The tactic requires great amounts of speed, organisation and stamina, with the idea of regaining possession of the ball as far up the pitch as possible to counter possible counter-attacks.<ref name="gegenpress">{{cite web |last1=Díaz |first1=Rehaan |title=What makes Liverpool's gegenpressing so good? |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/what-makes-liverpool-gegenpressing-so-good |website=Sportskeeda |date=5 April 2018 |access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref> It also requires high levels of discipline: The team must be compact to close down spaces for the opponent to thread passes through, and must learn when to stop pressing to avoid exhaustion and protect from long balls passed into the space behind the pressing defence.<ref name="The Guardian"/> Despite Klopp's pressing tactics resulting in a high attacking output, his Liverpool side was criticised at times for its inability to control games and tendency to concede goals as well as score them.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGuire |first1=Sam |title=Analysing Liverpool's approach to controlling games and how it can be improved |url=https://www.thisisanfield.com/2018/02/jurgen-klopps-current-approach-controlling-games-right-liverpool/ |website=This is Anfield |date=7 February 2018 |access-date=30 December 2018}}</ref> However, Klopp developed his tactics to incorporate more possession based football and more defensive and midfield organisation,<ref>{{cite news |title=Liverpool's 17-game unbeaten run a result of improved control, says Klopp |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/english-soccer/liverpool-s-17-game-unbeaten-run-a-result-of-improved-control-says-klopp-1.3725304 |access-date=30 December 2018 |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=9 December 2018}}</ref> as well as overseeing the transfers of Alisson Becker, Virgil Van Dijk, Naby Keïta and Fabinho ahead of the 2018–19 season which saw Liverpool achieve their best league start in the club's history, and equal the all-time record for the fewest goals conceded at the mid-point of a top-flight season, conceding just 7 goals and keeping 12 clean sheets.<ref name="Planet Football"/>

One of Klopp's main influences is Italian coach [[Arrigo Sacchi]], whose ideas about the closing down of space in defence and the use of zones and reference points inspired the basis of Klopp's counter-pressing tactics, as well as [[Wolfgang Frank]], his former coach during his time as a player for Mainz from 1995 to 1997 and then 1998 to 2000. Klopp himself said "I've never met Sacchi, but I learned everything I am as a coach from him and my former coach [Frank], who took it from Sacchi".<ref name="gegenpress" />

The importance of emotion is something Klopp has underlined throughout his managerial career, saying "Tactical things are so important, you cannot win without tactical things, but the emotion makes the difference".<ref name="gegenpress" /> He believes that the players should embrace their emotions, describing how "[football is] the only sport where emotion has this big of an influence".<ref name="emotion">{{cite news |last1=Carroll |first1=James |title=Jürgen Klopp: How positive emotion can help us today |url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/330284-jurgen-klopp-liverpool-manchester-united |access-date=28 December 2018 |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |date=16 December 2018}}</ref> Ahead of the Merseyside derby in 2016, Klopp said "The best football is always about expression of emotion".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hamouda |first1=Omar |title=Liverpool players must be prepared to "hurt" themselves in derby clash with Everton – Jurgen Klopp |url=http://www.squawka.com/en/news/liverpool-players-must-be-prepared-to-hurt-themselves-in-derby-clash-with-everton-jurgen-klopp/648517#0s3XEp9XquvkjCk2.97 |access-date=29 December 2018 |website=Squawka |date=19 April 2016}}</ref>

In his first two full seasons at Liverpool, Klopp almost exclusively employed a [[Formation (association football)#4–3–3|4–3–3]] formation, using a front three of wingers Mohamed Salah and [[Sadio Mané]] surrounding [[Forward (association football)#False 9|false-9]] Roberto Firmino, supported by [[Philippe Coutinho]] in midfield.
