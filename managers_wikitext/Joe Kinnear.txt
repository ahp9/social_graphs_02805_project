'''Joseph Patrick Kinnear''' (27 December 1946 – 7 April 2024) was an Irish professional [[Association football|football]] manager and player. As a  [[defender (association football)|defender]], Kinnear spent the majority of his career spanning ten seasons with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and one with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]. With Tottenham he won the [[FA Cup]], the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] twice, the [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]], and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. After Spurs, Kinnear played for Brighton for the 1975–76 season. Having been born in [[Dublin]], Kinnear played and was [[cap (sport)|cap]]ped 26 times for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]]. After his playing career, he managed [[India men's national football team|India]], [[Nepal national football team|Nepal]], [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]], [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].

==Early life==
Kinnear moved to England at the age of eight. His father died when Kinnear was young and his mother brought up five children on a [[Council house|council]] estate in [[Watford]].<ref name="Guardian1">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/dec/28/newcastleunited-premierleague | title=Kinnear: A man you can swear by | work=The Guardian | date=28 December 2008 | access-date=24 June 2013 | first=Jon|last=Henderson | archive-date=17 April 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230417113652/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/dec/28/newcastleunited-premierleague | url-status=live }}</ref> Kinnear captained his school and the Hertfordshire team and was noticed by [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City]].{{sfn|Goodwin|1992|pp=219–220}}

===Wimbledon===
Kinnear briefly took charge of Doncaster after Mackay's departure in 1989, but was replaced by [[Billy Bremner]] after a consortium completed their takeover of the club.<ref name=football/> Kinnear was appointed reserve team manager of [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] later that year before being appointed manager at the club following [[Peter Withe]]'s dismissal in January 1992.

[[1994–95 FA Premier League|The next season]] Kinnear continued to defy the odds and Wimbledon finished 9th in the league.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.premierleague.com/match/1376| title=Matchweek 37| work=Premier League| access-date=19 August 2020| archive-date=27 November 2020| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127235229/https://www.premierleague.com/match/1376| url-status=live}}</ref>

It was reported that Kinnear turned down the chance to replace [[Jack Charlton]] as manager of the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]] in 1996 because the [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]] did not offer him enough money.<ref>{{cite web | title=Kinnear turned down Ireland interview | work=Irish Examiner | date=17 January 2003 | url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/soccer/arid-30084656.html | access-date=8 April 2024 | archive-date=8 April 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240408071847/https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/soccer/arid-30084656.html | url-status=live }}</ref> Kinnear then guided Wimbledon to semi-finals in both of the major domestic cup competitions in 1997 as well as finishing 8th in the [[1996–97 FA Premier League|Premier League]].<ref name=AFCW/> When Wimbledon were taken over by new Norwegian owners after the end of that season, it was widely reported that Kinnear would be axed as manager in favour of Norwegian coach [[Åge Hareide]], but no change happened and Kinnear remained as manager for a further two seasons.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/doubts-over-the-future-of-kinnear-1255716.html?CMP=ILC-refresh | title=Doubts over the future of Kinnear | work=The Independent | first=Alan | last=Nixon | date=13 June 1997 | access-date=22 August 2017 | archive-date=13 September 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913093227/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/doubts-over-the-future-of-kinnear-1255716.html?CMP=ILC-refresh | url-status=live }}</ref>

Kinnear continued in his role as Wimbledon until he suffered a heart attack before a league game against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in March 1999. He stood down in June of that year and was replaced at Wimbledon by [[Egil Olsen]].<ref name=football/><ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jun/03/newsstory.sport4 |title = Wimbledon set for Scandinavian invasion |work = The Guardian |date = 3 June 1999 |access-date = 27 October 2008 |first = Jon |last = Brodkin |archive-date = 7 May 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140507215303/http://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jun/03/newsstory.sport4 |url-status = live }}</ref> Wimbledon were relegated from the Premier League [[1999–2000 FA Premier League|the following season]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.premierleague.com/match/3277| title=Matchweek 37| work=Premier League| access-date=19 August 2020| archive-date=2 January 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210102090538/https://www.premierleague.com/match/3277| url-status=live}}</ref>

===Luton Town===
Before returning to football management with [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], Kinnear was a front runner to replace [[Martin O'Neill]] at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]],<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jun/01/newsstory.sport11 |title = What now for Leicester? |work = The Guardian |date = 1 June 2000 |access-date = 10 October 2008 |first = Sean |last = Ingle |archive-date = 9 May 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140509013922/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jun/01/newsstory.sport11 |url-status = live }}</ref> and also considered taking over the struggling [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].<ref name="guardian_swfc">{{Cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/mar/17/newsstory.sport1 |title = Kinnear back where he belongs |work = The Guardian |date = 17 March 2001 |access-date = 10 October 2008 |first = Roy |last = Collins |archive-date = 13 April 2023 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230413233710/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/mar/17/newsstory.sport1 |url-status = live }}</ref> Instead, Kinnear would be briefly involved as [[director of football]] at [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] during the [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01 season]].<ref name="guardian_luton">{{Cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/feb/08/newsstory.sport4 |title = Firefighter Kinnear makes Luton his latest rescue mission |work = The Guardian |date = 8 February 2001 |access-date = 10 October 2008|first = Ian |last = Prior |archive-date = 9 May 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140509224724/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/feb/08/newsstory.sport4 |url-status = live }}</ref> In January 2001, he resigned, reportedly because of poor health.<ref name="guardian_luton" /> Kinnear's lack of input at Oxford was seen as the real reason behind his move away.<ref name="guardian_swfc" /> Just a few weeks later he was handed a similar role at Luton Town,<ref name="guardian_luton" /> who were battling against relegation from what was then the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], as were Oxford. On arrival, Kinnear demoted then-manager [[Lil Fuccillo]] and appointed himself manager of the team.

He could not save the club from relegation, despite purchasing striker [[Steve Howard]] for £50,000 on transfer deadline day. In the summer of 2001, Kinnear released the majority of the relegated squad, and brought in a number of his own men over the course of the season, including future captains [[Kevin Nicholls]] and [[Chris Coyne]], along with winger [[Jean-Louis Valois]]. The team stormed to promotion under Kinnear's guidance, finishing runners-up to [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] in the Hatters' first promotion in 20 years.<ref>{{cite web | last=Simmonds | first=Mike | title=Tributes flood in as former Luton, Newcastle and Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear dies | work=Luton Today | date=7 April 2024 | url=https://www.lutontoday.co.uk/sport/football/luton-town/tributes-flood-in-as-former-luton-newcastle-and-wimbledon-manager-joe-kinnear-dies-4582401 | access-date=8 April 2024 | archive-date=7 April 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240407211006/https://www.lutontoday.co.uk/sport/football/luton-town/tributes-flood-in-as-former-luton-newcastle-and-wimbledon-manager-joe-kinnear-dies-4582401 | url-status=live }}</ref>

The next season was disappointing for the Hatters, as they were expected to compete for promotion, but in the end they only managed a 9th-place finish. In May 2003 the club was sold to a consortium, led by [[John Gurney (football chairman)|John Gurney]], which led to Kinnear and his assistant [[Mick Harford]] being sacked in mysterious circumstances, citing a [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] employee's signature on the letters which confirmed the dismissal.<ref name="guardian_luton_sale">{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/mar/19/sport.georginaturner |title = Hatters putting mad spell behind them |work = The Guardian |date = 19 March 2004 |access-date = 10 October 2008 |first = Georgina |last = Turner |archive-date = 13 September 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140913002034/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/mar/19/sport.georginaturner |url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/jun/10/newsstory.sport8 |title = Luton directors quit as far-fetched merger is mooted |work = The Guardian |date = 10 June 2003 |access-date = 27 October 2008 |first = Michael |last = Walker |archive-date = 1 December 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161201224228/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/jun/10/newsstory.sport8 |url-status = live }}</ref>
