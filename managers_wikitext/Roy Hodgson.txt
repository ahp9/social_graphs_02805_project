==Playing career==
Hodgson was a moderately successful youth player with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], but was never able to break into the first team.<ref name=Palace/> After leaving Crystal Palace he played [[non-League football|non-league football]] for several years with [[Tonbridge Angels F.C.|Tonbridge]] and [[Ebbsfleet United F.C.|Gravesend & Northfleet]].<ref name="nonleague">{{cite news|url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/8250464.Former_Carshalton_boss_named_new_Liverpool_manager/|title=Former Carshalton player and Croydon-born Roy Hodgson named as new Liverpool manager|date=1 July 2010|work=Croydon Guardian|access-date=1 July 2010|archive-date=9 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009142438/http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/8250464.Former_Carshalton_boss_named_new_Liverpool_manager/|url-status=live}}</ref> At the age of 23, he completed training to gain his full coaching badge.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rudd|first=Alyson|title=Roy Hodgson hoping to play trump card on Sir Alex Ferguson|newspaper=[[The Times]]|language=en|url=https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/roy-hodgson-hoping-to-play-trump-card-on-sir-alex-ferguson-pw6nl6jpcvt|access-date=2021-03-29|issn=0140-0460|archive-date=24 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224204826/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/roy-hodgson-hoping-to-play-trump-card-on-sir-alex-ferguson-pw6nl6jpcvt|url-status=live}}</ref> He then joined [[Maidstone United F.C. (1897)|Maidstone United]], where he played and also served as assistant manager to Bob Houghton.<ref name="croydon" />

==Transition to coaching via teacher training==
Hodgson completed a teacher training course in 1972 at Avery Hill College, part of what is now the [[University of Greenwich]], where he was awarded a [[Certificate in Education]] with emphasis on physical education. Hodgson said of the experience: "When I went to the college it was mainly due to the obsession I had with football and I thought if they take me on and teach me to teach other people physical education, it will be the closest I might get to following my dream of working professionally in the game".<ref name="univ">{{cite web |title=Roy Hodgson CBE |url=https://alumni.gre.ac.uk/yourstories/roy-hodgson/ |publisher=University of Greenwich |access-date=20 January 2024}}</ref> He subsequently took a teaching job at Alleyn's School in Dulwich but left to briefly play football in South Africa.<ref name="univ"/>

In 1972, after a year at Maidstone, he moved to [[Ashford United F.C.|Ashford Town]],<ref name="nonleague" /> while also working as a [[Physical education|PE]] teacher at [[Alleyn's School]] in south London.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2019/08/roy-hodgson-english-footballs-internationalist |title=Roy Hodgson: English football's internationalist |work=The New Statesman |first=Rohan |last=Banerjee |date=2 August 2019 |access-date=4 January 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/jun/10/profile-roy-hodgson-england-euro2012 |title=Roy Hodgson: great expectations?

==Managerial career==
===Halmstad===
Hodgson started his managerial career in 1976 at [[Allsvenskan]] side [[Halmstads BK|Halmstad]], having been recommended by then-[[Malmö FF|Malmö]] manager [[Bob Houghton]].<ref name="croydon" /> Hodgson spent five years at Halmstad, winning the [[Swedish football champions|league championship]] in 1976 and 1979. His success with Halmstad in 1976 is considered one of the biggest surprises of all time in Swedish football.<ref name="The Man That is Roy Hodgson">{{cite web| url = http://www.fulhamweb.co.uk/news/The-man-that-is-Roy-Hodgson.aspx| title = The man that is Roy Hodgson| publisher = Fulham Web| date = 15 November 2009| access-date = 7 March 2010| archive-date = 17 March 2012| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120317150408/http://www.fulhamweb.co.uk/news/The-man-that-is-Roy-Hodgson.aspx| url-status = live}}</ref> The year before, Halmstad struggled against relegation, surviving on just goal difference and before the 1976 campaign began they were almost universally tipped for relegation. Hodgson himself says that "my greatest achievement would have to be the [[Marriage at Cana|water-into-wine]] job at Halmstad."<ref name="The Man That is Roy Hodgson" />

===Bristol City===
In 1980, Hodgson moved to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] in his native England, where he was assistant manager to Bob Houghton from 1980 to 1982 and manager from January to April 1982. Due to the club's financial problems he was largely unsuccessful and was dismissed after four months in charge.<ref name="Roy'sRoute"/> Commenting later on his time at Bristol City, Hodgson said: "Bristol City was nothing short of a disaster in that we had only been there for a matter of weeks before the banks started to pull the rug from underneath the club. My job when I eventually took over, as caretaker manager, was quite simply to carry on in the aftermath of all the players leaving the club and just fulfilling the fixtures."<ref name=Delighted/>

===Oddevold, Örebro===
In 1982, Hodgson moved back to Sweden to take over [[Swedish football Division 2|second-tier]] side [[IK Oddevold|Oddevold]] part-way through the [[1982 Swedish football Division 2|1982 season]]. Hodgson could not save the club from relegation as they finished eleventh, one point off safety. In 1983, he moved to fellow Division 2 side [[Örebro SK|Örebro]].<ref name="Roy'sRoute"/> In his [[1983 Swedish football Division 2|first season]], Örebro finished third. In his [[1984 Swedish football Division 2|second season]], the club finished first but the missed out on promotion to [[Allsvenskan]] after losing in the play-off to [[Mjällby AIF|Mjällby]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://home.swipnet.se:80/clasglenning/Sweden/2ndlevel/21984.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125140843/http://home.swipnet.se/clasglenning/Sweden/2ndlevel/21984.htm|title=Division 2 (2nd level) 1984|archive-date=25 November 2009|access-date=3 July 2018|last=Glenning|first=Clas|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Malmö===
[[File:Roy Hodgson (1987).jpg|thumb|upright|Hodgson in 1987]]

In 1985, he took over at Malmö, which he led to five consecutive [[Swedish football champions|league championships]], two Swedish championships (at the time the Swedish championship was decided through play-offs) and two [[Svenska Cupen|Swedish Cups]]. His team took part regularly in European competitions: the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]], the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. In the [[1986–87 European Cup Winners' Cup]], they beat [[Apollon Limassol]] in the first round and [[KF Tirana|Tirana]] in the second round, losing to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in the quarter finals. In the [[1987–88 European Cup]], Malmö were eliminated in the first round by [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]]. In the [[1988–89 UEFA Cup]], Malmö beat [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]] in the first round after extra time and lost to the club Hodgson would manage seven years later, [[Inter Milan]], in the second round. Narrowly losing 1–0 at home, they secured a 1–1 draw at the [[San Siro]]. Hodgson's greatest continental achievement at Malmö came the following year in the [[1989–90 European Cup]], knocking Inter out in the first round, [[1989–90 European Cup#First round|winning 1–0 at home and drawing 1–1]] at the San Siro. In the second round, Malmö lost to [[KV Mechelen|Mechelen]].<ref>{{cite news |title=How Hodgson taught English ways to Swedes |url=https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/how-hodgson-taught-english-ways-to-swedes-f33p3xgdkvp |access-date=30 January 2022 |work=The Times |date=14 June 2012 |archive-date=30 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220130201622/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-hodgson-taught-english-ways-to-swedes-f33p3xgdkvp |url-status=live }}</ref> Due to his successful time at Malmö, Hodgson is still highly appreciated by the club's fans who have unofficially named a section of the [[Stadion (Malmö)|Stadion]] "Roy's Hörna" (Roy's Corner).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sport.co.uk/features/why-hodgson-is-the-right-man-to-steady-the-liverpool-ship/1120 |title=Why Hodgson is the right man to steady the Liverpool ship |publisher=Sport.co.uk |date=30 June 2010 |access-date=10 December 2013 |archive-date=24 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104645/http://www.sport.co.uk/features/why-hodgson-is-the-right-man-to-steady-the-liverpool-ship/1120 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Influence on Swedish football===
His early coaching career was closely linked to that of his friend Bob Houghton; they worked together at Maidstone and Bristol City and they both worked in Swedish football at the same time. Houghton moved to Sweden with Malmö in 1974 and two years later installed Hodgson at Halmstad. The pair are credited with transforming football in Sweden<ref name=Lagerbackfaces>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jun/18/worldcup2006.sport3 |title=Lagerback faces familiar foes |work=The Observer |date=17 June 2006 |access-date=20 June 2012 |archive-date=20 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020104908/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jun/18/worldcup2006.sport3 |url-status=live }}</ref> and bringing in [[zonal marking]] for the first time to Swedish football.<ref name=Lagerbackfaces/> Swedish teams at the time were influenced by German football<ref name=invertingpyramid>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Jonathan |date=2009 |title=Inverting the Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics |publisher=Orion Books |isbn=978-1-4091-0204-5 |pages=297–301}}</ref> and used a sweeper with three or five in defence, favouring man-marking.<ref>{{cite web |author=Articles |url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/3081 |title=Roy Hodgson's coaching philosophy and tactics |publisher=LFChistory.net |access-date=20 June 2012 |archive-date=26 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626160342/http://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/3081 |url-status=live }}</ref> The two were known in Sweden as English Roy and English Bob.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9248237/From-Halmstad-to-Wembley-how-Swedish-icon-Roy-Hodgson-ended-up-as-England-manager.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9248237/From-Halmstad-to-Wembley-how-Swedish-icon-Roy-Hodgson-ended-up-as-England-manager.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=From Halmstad to Wembley: how 'Swedish icon' Roy Hodgson ended up as England manager |work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=20 June 2012 |first=Simon |last=Briggs |date=5 May 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Besides zonal marking, the defence pressed hard and maintained a high offside line.<ref name=invertingpyramid/> Their teams counter-attacked with long passes played in behind the opposition's defence.<ref name=invertingpyramid/> Instead of playing with a team that was very spread out from one end of the field to the other, with a libero who stayed in his penalty area and a centre-forward who never tracked back, they set up a system of zonal defence, a back four, players pushing up and getting the ball forward into the final area much more quickly.<ref name=invertingpyramid/><ref name="4–4–2-England">{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/05/euro-2012-roy-hodgson-england-tactics |title=The Question: Does 4–4–2 work for England? |work=The Guardian |date=5 June 2012 |access-date=20 June 2012 |archive-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516175440/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/05/euro-2012-roy-hodgson-england-tactics |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Neuchâtel Xamax===
Malmö offered Hodgson a lifetime contract, but he declined, saying later that "moving to another place seemed exciting. The decision was also financial. Swedish taxes were so high that even if you were being paid reasonable money, after losing 65% in tax there wasn't a lot left."<ref name="The Man That is Roy Hodgson" /> Hodgson moved to Swiss side [[Neuchâtel Xamax FCS|Neuchâtel Xamax]] in July 1990. In his [[1990–91 Nationalliga A|first season]] in charge, Xamax finished third in both the league and the subsequent championship play-off league, qualifying for the [[1991–92 UEFA Cup]]. In the [[1991–92 Nationalliga A|following season]], Xamax finished fifth in the league and then finished second in the championship play-off league, missing out on the title to [[FC Sion|Sion]] by just two points. In Europe, he led Xamax to a 2–0 win on aggregate over [[Floriana F.C.|Floriana]] and then a 5–2 aggregate win over [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. In the third round, Xamax were drawn against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and they won their home tie 1–0 but were eliminated after a 4–0 defeat at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Bernabéu]].<ref name=Delighted/>

===Switzerland===
Hodgson took over as manager of the [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland national team]] from [[Uli Stielike]] on 26 January 1992.<ref name=SwitzerlandRecord>{{cite web |url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablesz/zwit-intres.html |title=Switzerland – International matches since 1905 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |first=Erik |last=Garin |date=29 March 2018 |access-date=13 June 2018 |archive-date=13 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220713205854/https://www.rsssf.org/tablesz/zwit-intres.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Stielike had been the first Swiss coach to have a winning record,<ref name=SwitzerlandRecord/> winning 13 of the 25 games he was in charge of. As Hodgson was succeeding Stielike at the national level, Stielike took over the job Hodgson had just vacated at club level with [[Swiss Super League]] side Neuchâtel Xamax.

Switzerland had not qualified for a major international tournament since the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]]. Hodgson took the ''Schweizer Nati'' to the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], losing only one game during [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA – Group 1)|qualification]], from a group that included [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].<ref>{{cite web |title=World Cup 1994 qualifications |website=[[RSSSF]] |url=https://www.rsssf.org/tables/94qual.html |access-date=30 January 2022 |archive-date=11 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511105448/http://www.rsssf.com/tables/94qual.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The campaign, in which the Swiss came one point behind Italy, resulted in them rising to third in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].<ref name=four>{{cite news |last1=Massarella |first1=Louis |title=What Roy Hodgson learned with Switzerland at USA '94 |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/what-roy-hodgson-learned-switzerland-usa-94 |access-date=30 January 2022 |work=FourFourTwo |date=5 June 2014 |archive-date=30 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220130191409/https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/what-roy-hodgson-learned-switzerland-usa-94 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="The Man That is Roy Hodgson" />

In the finals in the United States, the Swiss finished as runners-up in [[1994 FIFA World Cup Group A|Group A]] alongside [[Romania national football team|Romania]], [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] and the [[United States national men's soccer team|host team]]. They drew 1–1 with the Americans in their opening game in the [[Silverdome|Pontiac Silverdome]]; the first indoor World Cup game was played in extreme heat, and he admitted to not preparing for the conditions.<ref name=four/> The Swiss defeated a strong Romania team 4–1, qualifying for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|Round of 16]], where they lost 3–0 to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] due to changing to an attacking formation after conceding an early goal.<ref name=four/>

The Swiss [[UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying#Group 3|qualified]] for [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]], again losing only one game during qualification to finish top of [[UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying Group 3|Group 3]]. With their place at Euro 1996 assured, Hodgson left immediately after qualification, on 15 November 1995, to join Italian club [[Inter Milan]]. He had in fact been doing both jobs from October of that year.<ref name="Hodgson'sChoice"/>

Part of Hodgson's success with the Swiss was to negotiate with the [[Swiss Super League]] for international players to train with him on Mondays and Tuesdays after playing for their clubs at the weekend, thus creating a club atmosphere in the national team.<ref name=four/>

===Inter Milan===
Before the European Championships, Hodgson joined Italian [[Serie A]] giants Inter Milan, where he worked from 1995 to 1997. With significant investment, he presided over a rebuilding phase. Inter had finished thirteenth and sixth in the seasons before his arrival. After a terrible start to the season that saw the team bottom of Serie A, Hodgson was brought in and guided the club to seventh place in the [[1995–96 Serie A|1995–96 season]], qualifying for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. In an interview with ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' magazine from May 2005, [[Roberto Carlos]] stated that he had difficulties with Hodgson throughout the 1995–96 season, and that his decision to leave Inter at the end of the season was largely due to Hodgson's refusal to field him in his preferred position, as a left-back, rather than in a more advanced position on the wing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/one-on-one/236/article.aspx |title=Roberto Carlos – One-on-One |work=[[FourFourTwo]] |date=31 July 2009 |access-date=1 May 2012 |archive-date=8 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508170209/http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/one-on-one/236/article.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[1996–97 Serie A|1996–97 season]] saw Hodgson leave Inter after guiding them to a third-place finish. He was replaced by [[Luigi Simoni]] whose side finished second in the league in the [[1997–98 Serie A|1997–98 season]] and won the UEFA Cup. In an interview in 2009, Hodgson recalled his time at Inter: "We lacked stars, apart from [[Paul Ince]]. It wasn't the Inter we see today of household names. They weren't the best technically but physically they were like machines. The Premier League is like that now, but back then Italy was far ahead."<ref name="The Man That is Roy Hodgson" />

Hodgson managed to get his Inter team, containing [[Javier Zanetti]], [[Youri Djorkaeff]] and Ince, through to the [[1997 UEFA Cup Final]], where they played [[Schalke 04]]. Given that Inter had a recent history of winning UEFA Cup finals, with victories in both 1991 and 1994, the Italian side started as favourites. It was the last UEFA Cup final to be played over two legs, with each club winning their home leg 1–0. When the German underdogs won the final in Milan on penalties, Inter fans pelted Hodgson with coins and lighters.<ref>[http://tomkinstimes.com/2010/06/does-roy-hodgson-have-the-credentials/ Does Roy Hodgson Have The Credentials?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827001259/http://tomkinstimes.com/2010/06/does-roy-hodgson-have-the-credentials/ |date=27 August 2010 }} ''The Tomkins Times'', 29 June 2010</ref> The final was his last match in charge and he subsequently left to become the manager of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. In the same 2009 interview, Hodgson recalled how club president [[Massimo Moratti]] tried to talk him out of leaving: "I could have stayed. They offered me a new contract, but I had a feeling that they wanted a change. So I allowed my contract at Inter to run out. Even after I agreed to join Blackburn, Moratti did say to me: 'I don't know why you didn't stay here, but if that's what you want to do I won't stand in your way.'"<ref name="thrown">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9242220/England-manager-Roy-Hodgson-had-big-stars-at-Inter-Milan-but-he-handled-everything-thrown-at-him.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9242220/England-manager-Roy-Hodgson-had-big-stars-at-Inter-Milan-but-he-handled-everything-thrown-at-him.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=England manager Roy Hodgson had big stars at Inter Milan but he handled everything thrown at him |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2 May 2012|access-date=18 June 2012 |first=Jonathan |last=Liew}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Speaking about Hodgson's time at Inter, club president Massimo Moratti said: "Roy Hodgson was an important person in the development of Inter Milan to the point we have reached today. He saved us at the right time. When he came we were in trouble and things appeared dark. He didn't panic, he was calm and made us calm. Disaster was averted at the most important time. Everyone at Inter will remember him for that and his contribution. He is considered by us all as an important person in our history. He left an endowment to this club that's important in our history."<ref name="carlos">{{cite web |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Roy-Hodgson-saved-Inter-Milan-and-the-Fulham-boss-is-the-perfect-man-to-turn-Liverpool-around-says-Massimo-Moratti-article448745.html |title=Hodgson has the 'qualities' to ease Anfield troubles |publisher=Mirror Football |date=4 June 2012 |access-date=18 June 2012 |archive-date=12 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712132149/http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Roy-Hodgson-saved-Inter-Milan-and-the-Fulham-boss-is-the-perfect-man-to-turn-Liverpool-around-says-Massimo-Moratti-article448745.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Blackburn Rovers===
Hodgson was one of three targets for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] owner [[Jack Walker]] when [[Ray Harford]] resigned as their manager in October 1996, along with [[Terry Venables]] and [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]]. The following February, with his Inter contract due to expire in July, he agreed to move upon its expiration to join Rovers for three years. As Eriksson had backed out of an agreement to move to the club, Hodgson signed a contract including a six-figure penalty if he did not join when freed by Inter.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rovers get Inter Milan boss Hodgson |url=https://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/6186199.rovers-get-inter-milan-boss-hodgson/ |access-date=30 January 2022 |work=Lancashire Telegraph |date=26 February 1997 |archive-date=30 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220130192702/https://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/6186199.rovers-get-inter-milan-boss-hodgson/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the [[1997–98 FA Premier League|1997–98 season]], his first season in charge, Blackburn finished sixth, qualifying for the UEFA Cup and appearing to be in the ascendancy, especially as they had been outsiders in the title race for more than half of the season and Hodgson had been voted [[Premier League Manager of the Month]] on two occasions, in August and December 1997. However, the team's form collapsed dramatically in the second half of the season and it was only on the last day of the season that they secured a UEFA place.<ref name="guardian_sacking"/>

Hodgson's second season with Blackburn did not match the relative success of the first, due to numerous injuries,<ref name="autogenerated1998">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/219167.stm Hodgson quits as Rovers hit bottom] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220627200821/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/219167.stm |date=27 June 2022 }} BBC Sport, 21 November 1998</ref> dressing room unrest, and the failure to find an adequate replacement for departed central defender [[Colin Hendry]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-blackest-day-for-hodgson-1186464.html | work=The Independent | first=Adam | last=Szreter | title=Football: Blackest day for Hodgson | date=22 November 1998 | access-date=4 December 2017 | archive-date=20 December 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220150656/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-blackest-day-for-hodgson-1186464.html | url-status=live }}</ref> As a result, Blackburn had a poor start to the season.

===Copenhagen, Udinese===
Hodgson moved to Denmark in July 2000 and became manager of Copenhagen, where he proved an instant success, taking a team that had finished seventh and eighth in the two previous seasons to the [[Danish Superliga|Superliga]] championship in the [[2000–01 Danish Superliga|2000–01 season]] – the club's first championship since 1993. His team also won the 2001 [[Danish Supercup]]. In 2001, he left Copenhagen to move to [[Serie A]] side [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]].

Hodgson made half a dozen signings in the January transfer window, the most important proving to be centre half [[Brede Hangeland]], who would go on to become a key player for the club and who Hodgson had managed at Viking.

Players joining Fulham before the [[2009–10 Premier League|2009–10 season]] included right back [[Stephen Kelly (Irish footballer)|Stephen Kelly]] and midfielders [[Bjørn Helge Riise]], [[Damien Duff]] and [[Jonathan Greening]]. Hodgson enjoyed a fantastic run in the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]]. The club's campaign, which started in July 2009 in the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League#Third qualifying round|third qualifying round]], featured impressive performances in the group stage, including defeating [[FC Basel|Basel]] at the hostile [[St. Jakob-Park]] in the final group game to qualify for the knockout stage at the expense of the Swiss club. In the following rounds, Fulham went on to eliminate holders [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] 3–2 on aggregate, Italian runners-up [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] 5–4 on aggregate and German champions [[VfL Wolfsburg|Wolfsburg]] 3–1 on aggregate. The victory against Juventus was especially memorable. Fulham lost 3–1 in [[Turin]] and went 4–1 down on aggregate in the second minute of the second leg at Craven Cottage. However, a goal from Bobby Zamora, a brace from [[Zoltán Gera]] and a late winner from [[Clint Dempsey]] meant that Fulham won the tie 5–4 on aggregate. On 29 April 2010, Hodgson guided Fulham to their first major European final in their 130-year history, winning the home leg 2–1 after a 0–0 away draw to gain a 2–1 aggregate victory over [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg]] in the Europa League semi-final.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8649420.stm|title=Fulham 2–1 Hamburg (agg 2–1)|date=28 April 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Phil|last=McNulty|access-date=11 May 2010|archive-date=1 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501140012/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8649420.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> In [[2010 UEFA Europa League Final|the final]] on 12 May at the [[Volksparkstadion|HSH Nordbank Arena]] in [[Hamburg]], Fulham played Spanish club [[Atlético Madrid]]. The game went to extra time at 1–1 after first-half goals from [[Diego Forlán]] and [[Simon Davies (footballer born 1979)|Simon Davies]]. With a penalty shoot-out looming and just four minutes remaining, Forlán scored again to win the game for Atlético Madrid. In the Premier League, the Europa League commitments showed as their League form became inconsistent. Fulham lost four of their first six games before losing only one of their following 12. Five successive defeats preceded a run of five unbeaten. Three straight defeats were then followed by three unbeaten before their final four games garnered one win and three defeats, meaning the club finished twelfth, just four points off ninth place. The club also enjoyed another good run in the FA Cup, again reaching the quarter-final before losing the replay to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].

Hodgson's first game in charge ended in a 1–1 home draw against West Brom's [[Black Country derby|Black Country rivals]] Wolverhampton Wanderers. Hodgson helped West Brom to five wins and five draws from their twelve remaining games, including an important 2–1 win at [[The Hawthorns]] against Liverpool, a result that some in the media dubbed "Roy's Revenge".<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_bromwich_albion/9444882.stm| title = West Brom boss Roy Hodgson plays down Liverpool revenge| date = 2 April 2011| access-date = 21 June 2011| publisher = BBC Sport| archive-date = 17 March 2023| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230317213413/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_bromwich_albion/9444882.stm| url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url = http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2011/04/03/2423645/roy-hodgson-scores-the-ultimate-revenge-as-liverpools| title = Roy Hodgson scores the ultimate revenge as Liverpool's European hopes begin to fade| date = 3 April 2011| access-date = 21 June 2011| publisher = goal.com| archive-date = 6 April 2011| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110406125136/http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2011/04/03/2423645/roy-hodgson-scores-the-ultimate-revenge-as-liverpools| url-status = live}}</ref> West Brom finished 11th in the final table, their highest league finish for three decades.<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9439626.stm| title = West Brom 2 – 1 Liverpool| date = 2 April 2011| access-date = 2 April 2011| publisher = BBC Sport| archive-date = 25 August 2020| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200825184056/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9439626.stm| url-status = live}}</ref>

Despite having to deal with West Brom's notoriously frugal approach to the transfer market, Hodgson made several signings in the summer of 2011, replacing goalkeeping duo [[Boaz Myhill]] and [[Scott Carson]] with former [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] goalkeeper [[Ben Foster (footballer)|Ben Foster]] on loan from [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and drafting in [[Márton Fülöp]] from [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] on a free transfer. Experience and height was added to the backline in the form of Northern Ireland international [[Gareth McAuley]] on a free transfer and recently relegated [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]'s player of the season [[Billy Jones (footballer born 1987)|Billy Jones]] also arrived to add cover at fullback. Prior to the start of the season, former Hawthorns hero [[Zoltán Gera]] also returned on a free transfer from Fulham and a summer-long chase for [[Shane Long]] was finally ended with the Irish international signing for an undisclosed fee reported to be in the region of £4million. Long joined the club in time to make a scoring début in the season's opener.

Following good performances against Manchester United and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in their opening two fixtures, Hodgson's usual 4–4–2 formation was replaced with a 4–4–1–1 or a 4–3–3 formation.<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/apr/30/roy-hodgson-england-classroom-tracksuit| title = Roy Hodgson's classroom skills as vital to England as tracksuit repute| date = 30 April 2012| access-date = 21 June 2012| work = The Guardian| first = Dominic| last = Fifield| archive-date = 9 March 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160309212350/http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/apr/30/roy-hodgson-england-classroom-tracksuit| url-status = live}}</ref>

Despite his side being continually beset with injuries to key players and the season-long loss of Zoltan Gera to a cruciate ligament injury in only his second start after returning, Hodgson's side always remained well above the relegation zone until the Christmas period when successive 2–1 home defeats to newly promoted duo [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] as well as to bottom club [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] saw them move within three points of 18th-place Bolton Wanderers.

With Hodgson repeatedly stating his ambition for the season was to ensure a third season of Premier League football for West Brom for the first time in almost 30 years, he once again raided Ipswich and Birmingham City for midfielder [[Keith Andrews (footballer)|Keith Andrews]] and full back [[Liam Ridgewell]] respectively in the January transfer window. In February 2012, he led West Brom to three consecutive wins, beating local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers 5–1 at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]]<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16893189| title = Wolves 1 – 5 West Brom| date = 12 February 2012| access-date = 21 June 2012| publisher = BBC Sport| archive-date = 26 January 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160126134512/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16893189| url-status = live}}</ref> and recording successive wins at The Hawthorns for the first time all season, beating [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] 4–0<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17093509| title = West Brom 4 – 0 Sunderland| date = 25 February 2012| access-date = 21 June 2012| publisher = BBC Sport| archive-date = 1 March 2012| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120301094217/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17093509| url-status = live}}</ref> and Chelsea 1–0.<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17163246| title = West Brom 1 – 0 Chelsea| date = 3 March 2012| access-date = 21 June 2012| publisher = BBC Sport| archive-date = 6 March 2012| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120306144223/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17163246| url-status = live}}</ref> West Brom's form in the final third of the season saw them win six, draw three and lose five from a difficult run-in involving games against seven of the top eight teams.

==FA commission==
On 20 October 2013, Hodgson and [[Rio Ferdinand]] were appointed to [[The Football Association]]'s commission to improve the state of the national game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24603866|work=BBC Sport|title=Rio Ferdinand & Roy Hodgson join Football Association commission|access-date=20 October 2013|date=20 October 2013|archive-date=20 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020162211/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24603866|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Style of management==

In a 2012 article for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Jonathan Wilson (writer)|Jonathan Wilson]] described Hodgson's tactical set-up, containing game, and "prosaic" use of the [[4–4–2 formation]] as "simple, unfussy and solid."<ref name="4–4–2-England"/> He expressed the belief that it was the most suitable and effective set-up for England to use at Euro 2012, stating:

{{blockquote|When out of possession, the back four stays perfectly in line, moving forward and back as though one unit, the midfield four (or five) rippling according to where the ball was, one advancing, the other three (or four) forming the blanket of cover behind, maintaining a gap of no more than 15 yards, often less, to the defensive line.<ref name="4–4–2-England"/>}}

Wilson also noted that Hodgson, like his compatriot Bob Houghton, employed a zonal defence while coaching in the Allsvenskan, and that his teams pressed hard and maintained a high back-line, making use of the offside trap. They also utilised counter-attacks that were initiated with long passes played in behind the opposing defensive line.<ref name="4–4–2-England"/> Swedish academic Tomas Peterson believed that the managers "threaded together a number of principles, which could be used in a series of combinations and compositions, and moulded them into an organic totality — an indivisible project about how to play football. Every moment of the match was theorised, and placed as an object-lesson for training-teaching, and was looked at in a totality."<ref name="4–4–2-England"/>

In an article with ''The Blizzard'', Hodgson noted that he and Houghton were attempting to introduce a different style of defending in Swedish football, rather than elements of English football, such as the long-ball game, stating: "Instead of playing with a team that was very spread out from one end of the field to the other, with a libero who stays in his penalty area and a centre-forward who never tracks back, we set up a system of zonal defence, a back four, people pushing up and, of course, getting the ball forward into the final area much more quickly." He also believed that Sven-Göran Eriksson's tactical innovations in the Swedish game were inspired by their own work.<ref name="Hodgson's coaching philosophy and tactics"/><ref name="4–4–2-England"/>
