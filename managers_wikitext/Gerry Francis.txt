'''Gerald Charles James Francis''' (born 6 December 1951) is an English former [[association football|footballer]] and manager.

==Playing career==
Francis made his first team debut for [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in March 1969. He was captain and central midfield player during the 1970s and was a key player in the QPR side, which came close to winning their first-ever league title in 1976. He won 12 [[cap (football)|caps]] for the [[England national football team|England team]] between 1974 and 1976, and was captain for eight of those matches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamPlyrsBios/PlayersF/BioFrancisGCJ.html|title=England Players – Gerry Francis|website=www.englandfootballonline.com|access-date=27 March 2019}}</ref> His International career was limited by a persistent back injury. He left QPR for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in 1979, although he subsequently returned to QPR for a 2nd spell, before a move to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]].<ref name="grecianarchive">{{Cite web |url=http://grecianarchive.exeter.ac.uk/items/show/1576 |title=Francis, Gerry |website=grecianarchive.exeter.ac.uk |language=en |access-date=27 March 2019}}</ref> However this was a time when he suffered injury problems.

===Later career===
In August 1983, he was appointed player-manager of [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] although they endured a difficult season.<ref name="grecianarchive" /> Francis then had further short playing spells at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] before a move to [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] in 1985 yielded 32 league appearances, where he ended his playing career in 1986 prior to a short non-playing stint as player-coach at Wimbledon.

==Management career==

===Bristol Rovers===
Following a spell as defensive coach at Wimbledon he succeeded [[Bobby Gould]] as manager of [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] side [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]].<ref name="grecianarchive" /> In 1990, he guided the Pirates to the Third Division title and thus they won promotion to the Second Division, but a year later he returned to QPR as manager.<ref name="grecianarchive" />

===Queens Park Rangers===
In 1992–93, QPR finished fifth in the inaugural [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] – the highest placed of all the London teams. They finished ninth in 1993–94 and eighth in 1994–95, but in November 1994, Francis left [[Loftus Road]] for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].

During his three years in charge at QPR, Francis fielded a side containing some of the most feared players in the top flight. Arguably the finest player at the club during this time was striker [[Les Ferdinand]], who had joined the club from non-league [[Hayes F.C.|Hayes]] in 1986 but not established himself in the first team until the [[1990–91 in English football|season before Francis arrived]], when he scored eight goals in 18 First Division games. Francis kept faith in Ferdinand, and was rewarded in 1992–93 when the player hit 20 league goals in one season. Ferdinand remained at QPR until his £6million transfer to Newcastle in 1995, by which time he had scored 78 goals in five league campaigns and was one of the most feared strikers in England, being [[England national football team|capped]] for the first time in 1993. In July 1997, while manager of Tottenham Hotspur, Francis signed Ferdinand for £6million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/queens-park-rangers-fc/gerry-francis-6819/league-appearances-for-qpr_a14590/|title=Gerry Francis|website=www.sporting-heroes.net|access-date=25 January 2018}}</ref>

With the resignation of [[Graham Taylor]] as [[England national football team|England national team]] manager in November 1993 following failure to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], Francis was one of the many names linked to the vacancy, but the job went to [[Terry Venables]] instead. In March 1994, ambitious Division One club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] made a lucrative approach for Francis to drop down a division and take charge of the club looking to make the breakthrough to the Premier League, but he rejected the offer and Wolves turned to Graham Taylor instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-peacock-goes-but-francis-stays-mixed-day-at-queens-park-rangers-while-limpar-joins-everton-and-beagrie-hops-to-city-1431375.html|title=Football: Peacock goes but Francis stays: Mixed day at Queen's Park|website=[[Independent.co.uk]] |date=25 March 1994|access-date=25 January 2018}}</ref>

===Tottenham Hotspur===
1994–95 was a 'nearly' season for Tottenham. They finished seventh in the Premier League – two places off a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] place – and lost to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the semi-finals of the [[FA Cup]]. Mid table finishes in the next two seasons were unconvincing and Francis resigned in November 1997 with Spurs battling against relegation from the Premier League. During his time at Tottenham Francis became resented by the fans over his handling of star player [[Darren Anderton]]. It has been argued{{By whom|date=August 2023}} that Francis is largely responsible for Anderton's recurring injuries, placing him in the team without sufficient time to recover, which resulted in Anderton's appearing in only eight games in the 1995–96 season and 17 games in the 1996–97 season.

===Back to QPR===
In September 1998, Gerry Francis was named as QPR manager for the second time. They had slumped since his departure four years earlier and were now [[Football League First Division|Division One]] strugglers. He kept them clear of relegation over the next two seasons before finally resigning in February 2001 with a return to the lower half of the league imminent after more than 30 years. He briefly became Director of Football at QPR before beginning his second spell as manager of Bristol Rovers in June 2001.

===Bristol Rovers again===
Three successive wins at the start of the 2001–02 campaign gave the Pirates hope for promotion back to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]], but injuries soon took their toll on the side's form and Francis resigned just before Christmas. The Pirates continued to slide and missed out on relegation to the [[National League (English football)|Conference]] by just one place. Gerry Francis worked with Graham Muxworthy and [[Ian Holloway]] whilst at Bristol Rovers. Francis has not been in management since.

===Stoke City===
On 4 October 2008, he was offered a position of first team coach at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], however due to the uncertainty over the period of the role he decided to take up an offer from [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] to become their first team coach. He left Stoke at the end of the [[2012–13 Stoke City F.C. season|2012–13]] season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dave Kevan heads list of departures from the Britannia|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Stoke-City-Dave-Kevan-heads-list-departures/story-19078363-detail/story.html#axzz2UTjTvAxa|work=The Sentinel|access-date=27 May 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608115149/http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Stoke-City-Dave-Kevan-heads-list-departures/story-19078363-detail/story.html#axzz2UTjTvAxa|archive-date=8 June 2013}}</ref>

===Crystal Palace===
Francis followed former Stoke manager [[Tony Pulis]] to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] when he became a coach under Pulis at the London club.<ref>[http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-Gerry-Francis-banging-drum-sons-Tony/story-20458989-detail/story.html Stoke City: Gerry Francis banging drum for sons and Tony Pulis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924134645/http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Stoke-City-Gerry-Francis-banging-drum-sons-Tony/story-20458989-detail/story.html |date=24 September 2015 }}</ref> Following Pulis's surprise departure from the club in August 2014 Francis remained in his position in order to assist caretaker manager [[Keith Millen]].<ref>[http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Gerry-Francis-expresses-disappointment-Tony-Pulis/story-22752618-detail/story.html Gerry Francis expresses disappointment at Tony Pulis' departure from Crystal Palace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211613/http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Gerry-Francis-expresses-disappointment-Tony-Pulis/story-22752618-detail/story.html |date=23 September 2015 }}</ref> However, on 28 August 2014, following the appointment of [[Neil Warnock]] as [[Manager (association football)|manager]] it was announced by the club that Francis had left.<ref>{{cite web|title=Francis Moves On |website=cpfc.co.uk |publisher=Crystal Palace F.C. |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/august/francis-moves-on/ |date=28 August 2014 |access-date=25 January 2018}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Francis was a [[Brentford]] supporter as a youth and his father Roy was a professional at the club in the late 1940s and early 1950s.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A–Z of Bees: A Brentford Encyclopaedia |last=Haynes |first=Graham |date=1998 |publisher=Yore |isbn=1874427577 |location=Harefield |page=5 |oclc=39504068}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brentfordfc.com/news/2014/november/a-genuine-brentford-legend-george-francis/|title=A genuine Brentford legend: George Francis – News – Brentford FC|website=www.brentfordfc.com|language=en-gb|access-date=27 March 2019|archive-date=20 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200920203520/https://www.brentfordfc.com/news/2014/november/a-genuine-brentford-legend-george-francis/|url-status=dead}}</ref> His sons Adam and Jake were academy players at Queens Park Rangers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qpr.co.uk/news/archive/where-r-they-now-gerry-francis/|title=WHERE 'R' THEY NOW?
