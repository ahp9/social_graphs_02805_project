'''Howard Wilkinson''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|OBE}} (born 13 November 1943) is an English former [[Association football|footballer]] and manager. Despite having a low-profile playing career, Wilkinson embarked on a successful managerial career. He won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] championship in 1992 with [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], the final season before the creation of the [[Premier League]]. As FA Technical Director he was instrumental in the planning and development of English football's first [[St George's Park National Football Centre|National Football Centre]].<ref name="HowardWilkinson'ssacking">{{cite web

}}</ref> To date, he remains the last English manager to win the top-flight league in England. He later had spells as [[caretaker manager]] of the England senior and U21 teams.

Wilkinson was a founding member of the [[League Managers Association]] and served as its chairman from its formation in 1992 until his retirement in 2024.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.leaguemanagers.com/latest-news/lma-welcomes-martin-oneill-obe-as-new-chair |title=LMA welcomes Martin O'Neill OBE as new Chair |first=Martin | last = O'Neill |date=23 April 2024 |publisher=League Managers Association |access-date=1 November 2025}}</ref>

==Playing career==
Born in the [[Netherthorpe, Sheffield|Netherthorpe]] district of [[Sheffield]], Yorkshire, Wilkinson began his playing career with local team [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], before joining cross-city rivals [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], signing for them on 25 June 1962.

After making just 22 league appearances, he joined [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] on 9 July 1966 where he played over a hundred league matches as a winger. He left the club in 1971.

His final club was [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]]. Whilst there, he won several [[Northern Premier League]] titles. It was at the Pilgrims where he began his managerial career, being appointed [[player manager]] in 1975. He won two more Northern Premier League titles as manager. In December 1976 he was enticed away from Boston to join [[Mossley A.F.C.|Mossley]] as Player-Manager and guided them up the table to finish 9th, being unbeaten in 19 successive games. He played 30 matches for the club, scoring one goal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mossleyweb.com/PlayersAZ/AZW2.htm |title=Whitty to Wynn |website=www.mossleyweb.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725073804/http://www.mossleyweb.com/PlayersAZ/AZW2.htm |archive-date=2008-07-25}}</ref>

He has a degree in education from what is now [[Sheffield Hallam University]], where he graduated from in 1975.

==Managerial career==

===Notts County===
Wilkinson began his full-time coaching career in December 1979<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coachesvoice.com/howard-wilkinson-first-division-leeds-united/|title = A chance to fly|date = 13 January 2019}}</ref> at [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] when he was appointed a coach. He was taken on and tutored by County's manager [[Jimmy Sirrel]]. After Sirrell became the club's general manager in August 1982, Wilkinson became team manager for the [[1982–83 in English football|1982–83]] season and County managed a reasonable return of 52 points, achieving a finish of 15th in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].

===Sheffield Wednesday===
In June 1983, Wilkinson dropped down a division to become manager of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], where he established his reputation as a manager despite never having been a big-name player. Wednesday won promotion from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in his first season and Wilkinson maintained their place in England's top flight for the next four years – with a highest finish of fifth in the [[1985–86 in English football|1985–86]] season.

===Leeds United===
Wilkinson's greatest success as a manager came after moving to Wednesday's [[Yorkshire]] rivals [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in October 1988. He soon drilled discipline into a lacklustre squad and earned the affectionate nickname ''"Sergeant Wilko"'', a play on the old TV character ''[[Sergeant Bilko]]''. The team won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in [[1989–90 in English football|1989–90]] after the signings of [[Gordon Strachan]] who became captain, hardman [[Vinnie Jones]] (who Wilkinson guided to a whole season with only three yellow cards), [[Mel Sterland]], [[Chris Fairclough]] and [[Lee Chapman]]. Following the promotion, Wilkinson immediately offloaded Jones and brought in [[Gary McAllister]] from [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[John Lukic]] was brought back from [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. He also helped players who had come up through the youth team, [[Gary Speed]] and [[David Batty]], to mature to the new level of football.

In Leeds' first season in the First Division they performed very well for a newly promoted team and ended the season fourth in the league. Wilkinson felt further improvement was required on the squad and brought in [[Rod Wallace]], [[Tony Dorigo]] and [[Steve Hodge]] finalising his best squad with [[Eric Cantona]] in February 1992. Leeds won the last championship of the old style [[Football League First Division]] in 1992. As of 2024, Wilkinson is the last English manager to have coached a team to the English league championship title.

However, his subsequent time at Leeds was less successful. Leeds finished 17th in the [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93]] season, which is among the worst performances by a team who were reigning English champions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/nov/26/terrible-title-defences-manchester-city-leeds-chelsea |title=Terrible title defences: from Manchester City in 1938 to Leeds in 1993 |first=Jonathan |last=Wilson |date=26 November 2015 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Leeds improved with consecutive fifth-place finishes in [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94]] and [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95]], the latter earning the club a [[UEFA Cup]] spot. Leeds also reached the final of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[1996 Football League Cup Final|1996]], which they lost 3–0 to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Following a poor start to the [[1996–97 in English football|1996–97]] season, including a 4–0 home defeat to bitter rivals [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], on 9 September 1996, Wilkinson was sacked.

Howard Wilkinson made the decision to sell Cantona to Alex Ferguson's Manchester United on 27 November 1992 for £1.2m. The Frenchman went on to become a linchpin in the side that won four Premier League titles in five seasons.

Wilkinson was instrumental in the opening of Leeds' first modern academy and training facility at Thorp Arch in 1994 known as [[Thorp Arch (training ground)|The Grange]], named after Barcelona's [[La Masia]], translated in English as The Farmhouse.<ref name=wilkinsonthorparch>{{cite web

In December 1999, Wilkinson revealed that Arsenal had made an approach for him during the summer of 1995, when they were searching for a successor to [[George Graham (footballer, born 1944)|George Graham]], who had been sacked for accepting an illegal payment three years earlier. However, the Leeds board rejected Arsenal's approach for him and [[Bruce Rioch]] was appointed instead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/4018/29/ |title=When Saturday Comes - When Saturday Comes |first=Stephanie |last=Pride |access-date=6 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105082546/http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/4018/29/ |archive-date=5 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Shortly after his exit from [[Elland Road]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] chairman [[Francis Lee (footballer)|Francis Lee]] expressed interest in appointing Wilkinson as manager of the [[Maine Road]] club a few months after their relegation from the Premier League. However, when Wilkinson turned down the approach, Lee then turned to [[Frank Clark (footballer)|Frank Clark]], who had resigned as [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] manager.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/clarks-anxiety-leads-to-city-speculation-football-1314758.html |location=London |work=The Independent |date=16 December 1996 |title=Clark's anxiety leads to City speculation: Football}}</ref>

===The Football Association===
Four months after leaving Leeds, in January 1997, Wilkinson was hired by the sport's governing body in England, [[the Football Association]], to act as its Technical Director, overseeing coaching and other training programmes at all levels of the game. Whilst at Leeds, Wilkinson had developed a ten-year plan to create an "English [[La Masia]]" at [[Thorp Arch (training ground)|Thorp Arch]].<ref name=wilkinsonthorparch>{{cite web

}}</ref> In his role with the FA, Wilkinson applied this blueprint on a larger scale to the national game, developing the academy system and persuading the FA to begin the [[St George's Park National Football Centre|National Football Centre]] project. Wilkinson based the plans for the National Football Centre on the French system at [[INF Clairefontaine|Clairefontaine]] which nurtured the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship winners. In 1997 Wilkinson published the Charter for Quality which was the basis for which all English academies were to train future stars.<ref name="HowardWilkinson'ssacking">{{cite web

In his position as Technical Director of the FA, he managed the [[English national football team|England team]] on a caretaker basis in 1999 for a friendly against [[France national football team|France]] following the sacking of [[Glenn Hoddle]]. Following this he acted for a time as the permanent coach of the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 team]], controversially selecting himself to replace Hoddle's choice of manager, [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1953)|Peter Taylor]]. Wilkinson was unsuccessful in this role; despite inheriting a team who were unbeaten and yet to concede a goal, he lost three of his six matches in charge. Wilkinson resigned from the post in June 2001,<ref>{{cite news |date=2001-06-29 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1414169.stm |title=Wilkinson quits as Under-21 coach |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=2007-09-02}}</ref> to be replaced by [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]] (Taylor would end up back in charge three years later). He returned to the role of caretaker of the senior team in October 2000 following the resignation of Hoddle's permanent successor [[Kevin Keegan]], overseeing a 0–0 draw in a [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 9|World Cup]] qualifying match against [[Finland national football team|Finland]].

===Sunderland===
In October 2002, he left his role as FA Technical Director in order to return to club management at relegation threatened [[Premier League]] side [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], with [[Steve Cotterill]] as his assistant.<ref>{{cite news |date=2002-10-10 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/2315749.stm |title=Wilkinson takes Sunderland job |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=2007-09-02}}</ref> However, his time there was a disappointment, being unable to improve the form of a struggling side, and he departed on 10 March 2003.<ref>{{cite news |date=2003-03-10 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2838339.stm |title=Fans' shock at Wilkinson departure |publisher=BBC News |access-date=2007-09-02}}</ref> Sunderland eventually ended the season at the bottom of the Premier League with a then league-history-worst total of 19 points. He won two league games out of a possible twenty with his worst moment being a 3–1 home defeat to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on 1 February 2003 during which Sunderland scored three own goals within seven minutes.<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2694031.stm BBC Sport: Proctor gifts Addicks win]</ref>

At one point during his tenure, he was once asked some very pointed questions by a [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] reporter about a far from perfect performance. Wilkinson is said to have snapped and asked him what qualified him, as a mere reporter, to question professionals in this way. "Forty-three England caps, fifteen as captain" came the reply. The reporter concerned was [[Jimmy Armfield]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-02-12|title=Jimmy Armfield, footballer: England captain and Blackpool star who later shone as a pundit|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jimmy-armfield-england-captain-blackpool-football-radio-5-live-pundit-1966-world-cup-bolton-leeds-manager-a8206286.html|access-date=2021-02-22|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Prentice|first=David|date=2018-01-22|title=Wilkinson: How many caps have you lot won?

===Later career===
Wilkinson briefly returned to management in March 2004, taking charge of Chinese club [[Shanghai Shenhua]] on a short-term contract, but left two months later for personal reasons.<ref>{{cite news |date=2004-05-20 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3731223.stm |title=Wilkinson leaves Shanghai |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=2007-09-22}}</ref> In October 2004, he was temporarily appointed as first team coach of [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], following the departures of manager [[Micky Adams]] and coach [[Alan Cork]].<ref>{{cite news |date=2004-10-12 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/3735504.stm |title=Wilkinson accepts Leicester role |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=2007-09-02}}</ref> Wilkinson returned to Notts County in December 2004 where he became a [[non-executive director]].<ref>{{cite news |date=2004-12-30 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/notts_county/4135371.stm |title=Wilkinson returns to Notts County |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=2007-09-02}}</ref> He held a coaching role as technical director from June 2006 until September 2007 when he left the club altogether.<ref>{{cite news |date=2007-06-13 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/notts_county/5076058.stm |title=Wilkinson handed new Magpies role |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=2007-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=2007-09-10 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/notts_county/6986882.stm |title=Wilkinson and Moore leave County |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=2007-09-22}}</ref>

On 9 January 2009, Wilkinson was confirmed as the new Technical Adviser of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]<ref>{{cite news |date=2009-01-09 |url=http://www.swfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10304~1513303,00.html |title=Wilkinson makes Hillsborough return |publisher=swfc.co.uk |access-date=2009-01-09 |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100203085829/http://www.swfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10304~1513303,00.html |archive-date = 3 February 2010 |url-status     = dead}}</ref> Upon the resignation of [[Lee Strafford]] on 17 May 2010, Wilkinson became the interim chairman of the club.<ref name="YP-Strafford-resigns">{{cite web |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/Sheffield-Wednesday-chairman-Strafford-resigns.6299631.jp |title=Sheffield Wednesday chairman Strafford resigns |work=[[Yorkshire Post]] |date=17 May 2010 |access-date=17 May 2010}}</ref> He confronted fans after they protested against the club following a 1–0 defeat to Southampton. Notably, Wilkinson's primary function in his role was to negotiate the essential investment that Wednesday required to avoid the threat of administration, when a winding up petition was to be presented by [[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]] on 17 November 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_wed/8980290.stm |work=BBC News |title=Long-term is 'crucial' for Owls |date=2010-09-08}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101012031050/http://www.swfc.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10304~2179182%2C00.html "Club statement" swfc.co.uk, Archived 12 October 2010]</ref> This was achieved when [[Milan Mandarić]] was revealed as the new owner of the club. Mandarić, then the owner of [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], sold the club to [[Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha|Vichai]] and [[Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha]], as Football League rules prevented him from being the chairman of two different clubs. Wilkinson stayed on at Wednesday in a non-executive directorial role, until he resigned in early 2011.{{Cn|date=April 2025}}

Wilkinson helped author [[Jilly Cooper]] with research for her 2023 novel ''[[Tackle!]]<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last=Cooke |first=Rachel |date=2023-11-12 |title=Tackle! review – Jilly Cooper takes on the beautiful game |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/12/tackle-jilly-cooper-review-football |access-date=2025-04-22 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>''

== Awards ==
Wilkinson was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2024 New Year Honours]] for services to association football and charity.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=64269|supp=y|page=N16|date=30 December 2023}}</ref>

==Personal life==
