'''Kevin Ian Keen''' (born 25 February 1967) is an English [[Association football|football]] coach and former player. Keen is currently the coach of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] under-18 team.

Keen began his career with [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] before joining [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in 1983. He spent seven seasons with the "Hammers" twice gaining promotion and twice suffering relegation. He left for [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in 1993 before joining [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in October 1994. He helped Stoke reach the play-offs in [[1995–96 Stoke City F.C. season|1995–96]] losing out to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. Stoke then made the move to the [[Britannia Stadium]] but were relegated to Division Two in 1998. He spent two more seasons at Stoke helping the club again reach the play-offs and win the [[Football League Trophy]] in [[2000 Football League Trophy Final|2000]]. He then spent two seasons with [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] during which time he had a spell as caretaker manager.

After three spells as caretaker manager at West Ham, Keen left the club in July 2011 to take up the role of first team coach at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], where he would be reunited with old West Ham colleague [[Steve Clarke]]. He remained in this post until June 2012 leaving on the appointment of new manager [[Brendan Rodgers]]. In July 2012 he was again reunited with Clarke when he was appointed joint assistant head coach at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], and his next job was assistant manager at [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. He managed [[Football League One|League One]] club [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] between December 2015 and April 2016, but left the club after failing to avoid relegation to [[Football League Two|League Two]]. He joined [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]'s coaching staff in July 2016.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Keen is the son of former professional footballer [[Mike Keen]] who played in midfield for [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. He attended the [[John Hampden Grammar School]], High Wycombe and was a member of the High Wycombe U15 team that won the English Schools Trophy in 1981 and won several England schoolboy caps. A year later, Keen became the youngest ever player to appear in a first-team game for [[Isthmian League]] side [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], making his debut at 15 years and 209 days, in September 1982. He played three games for Wycombe before joining [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] as a 16-year-old apprentice.

===West Ham United===
Keen joined West Ham as an apprentice in 1983 and signed professional forms a year later in March 1984. He helped the reserve side to win the Combination League and won 15 England Youth caps. He made his debut as a substitute for [[Geoff Pike]] in a 5–2 home defeat against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in September 1986.<ref name="whustats">{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&ham=375&united=Kevin_Keen | title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics&nbsp;— Kevin Keen | publisher=westhamstats.info | access-date=21 March 2015}}</ref> He made 17 league and cup appearances in the 1986–87 as West Ham finished 15th in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] table.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&ham=1987&united=1st_Division_1986-87 | title=1st Division 1986-87 | publisher=westhamstats.info | access-date=21 March 2015}}</ref> This season saw his first West Ham goal, in a 4–1 home win against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient Orient]] in the 3rd round of the [[FA Cup]] on 31 January 1987.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&ham=3529&united=31_Jan_1987| title=Game played 31 January 1987 | publisher=westhamstats.info | access-date=21 March 2015}}</ref> He made another 25 appearances in the 1987–88 season and 33 appearances in the 1988–89 season as West Ham reached the semi-finals of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and were relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]].<ref name=whustats/> A change of West Ham manager from [[Lou Macari]] to [[Billy Bonds]] saw him become almost ever present in the 1989–90 season, making 57 league and cup appearances and scoring 13 goals, as West Ham finished seventh in the table and again reach the semi-finals of the League Cup. He made 51 appearances in the 1990–91 season helping West Ham to promotion to the First Division and to the semi-finals of the [[FA Cup]], and 39 appearances in 1991–92 as West Ham were relegated once more.<ref name=whustats/> The 1992–93 season saw his best form as he played in every league and cup game, making 56 appearances, as West Ham were promoted.
