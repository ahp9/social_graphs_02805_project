'''Alan Shearer''' (born 13 August 1970) is an English [[Association football|football]] pundit and former professional player who played as a [[striker (association football)|striker]]. Widely regarded as one of the best strikers of all time and one of the greatest players in [[Premier League]] history, he is the league's [[Premier League Top Scorers|record goalscorer]] with 260 goals.<ref name="topflightgoals" group="notes">Whilst Shearer holds the record for goals scored in the Premier League, formed in 1992, the record for goals scored in the top flight in English football is 357, held by [[Jimmy Greaves]]. Shearer has scored 283 top flight goals, including 23 in the [[Football League First Division]]. - {{cite web|title=England - All-Time Topscorers|url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablese/engtops-allt.html|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]|access-date=30 November 2017|archive-date=20 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220720140121/https://www.rsssf.org/tablese/engtops-allt.html|url-status=live}}</ref> He was named [[FWA Footballer of the Year|Football Writers' Association Player of the Year]] in 1994 and won the [[PFA Player of the Year]] award in 1995.

Shearer played his entire career in the top level of English football. He started his career at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 1988 before moving to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in 1992, where he established himself as among the most prolific goalscorers in Europe and won the [[1994–95 FA Premier League|1994–95 Premier League]]. In the summer of 1996, he joined his hometown club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for a then [[World football transfer record|world record]] £15 million, and in his first season won his third consecutive [[Premier League Golden Boot]]. He played in the [[1998 FA Cup Final|1998 FA Cup]] and [[1999 FA Cup Final|1999 FA Cup]] finals, captaining the team in the latter, and eventually became the club's all-time top scorer.<ref name="topflightgoals" group="notes" /> He retired at the end of the [[2005–06 Newcastle United F.C. season|2005–06 season]].

For the [[England national football team|England national team]], Shearer appeared 63 times and scored 30 goals.<ref>{{Englandstats|ref=y|access-date=8 August 2016|archive-date=6 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006204946/http://englandstats.com/players.php?pid=860|url-status=live}}</ref> [[UEFA Euro 1996]] was his biggest success at international football; England reached the semi-finals and Shearer was awarded the [[UEFA European Championship Golden Boot|UEFA Euro Golden Boot]] and was named in the [[UEFA European Championship Team of the Tournament|UEFA Euro Team of the Tournament]]. He went on to captain England at [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000]], then retired from international football.

Since retiring as a player in 2006, Shearer has worked as a television [[pundit]] for the [[BBC]]. In 2009, he briefly left his BBC role to become Newcastle United's manager in the last eight games of their [[2008–09 Newcastle United F.C. season|2008–09 season]], in an unsuccessful attempt to save them from relegation. Shearer is a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE), a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of [[Northumberland]], a [[Freedom of the City|Freeman]] of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and an [[Honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Civil Law]] of [[Northumbria University|Northumbria]] and [[Newcastle University|Newcastle Universities]].

==Early life==
Alan Shearer was born on 13 August 1970 in the [[Gosforth]] area of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]],<ref name="PFA 556">{{cite book|last = Hugman|first = Barry J.|title= The PFA Premier & Football League Players' Records 1946–2005|publisher = Queen Anne Press|year = 2005| page = 556| isbn = 1-85291-665-6 }}</ref> the son of Anne and sheet-metal worker Alan Shearer. His parents were [[working class]]. His father encouraged him to play football in his youth, and Shearer continued with the sport as he progressed through school. He was educated at Gosforth Central Middle School and [[Gosforth High School]]. Growing up, he played on the streets of his hometown and was originally a [[midfield]]er because "it meant [he] could get more involved in the games".<ref name=MIC>{{cite book |title=My Illustrated Career |last=Shearer |first=Alan |year=2007 |publisher=Cassell Illustrated |location=London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/alanshearermyill0000shea/page/18 18–50] |isbn=978-1-84403-586-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/alanshearermyill0000shea/page/18 }}</ref> Shearer captained his school team and helped a Newcastle City Schools team win a seven-a-side tournament at [[St James' Park]], before joining the amateur [[Wallsend Boys Club]] as a teenager. It was while playing for the Wallsend club that he was spotted by [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]'s scout [[Jack Hixon]], which resulted in him spending his summers training with the club's youth team, a time he would later refer to as "the making of me".<ref name=MIC/> Shearer had successful trials for [[Football League First Division|First Division]] clubs [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], before being offered a youth contract with Southampton in April 1986.<ref name="MIC"/>

==Club career==
===1986–1992: Southampton===
Shearer was promoted to the first team after spending two years with the youth squad. He made his professional debut for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 26 March 1988, coming on as a [[substitute (football)|substitute]] in a [[Football League First Division|First Division]] fixture at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]],<ref name =ITN199>{{cite book | author=Duncan Holley & Gary Chalk | title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC | publisher=Hagiology Publishing | year=2003|pages=199–200 | isbn=0-9534474-3-X}}</ref> before prompting national headlines in his full debut at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]] two weeks later. He scored a [[Hat-trick (association football)|hat-trick]], helping the team to a 4–2 victory against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], thus becoming the youngest player – at 17 years, 240 days – to score a hat-trick in the top division, breaking [[Jimmy Greaves]]' 30-year–old record.<ref name =ITN199/> Shearer ended the [[1987–88 in English football|1987–88]] season with three goals in five games, and was rewarded with his first professional contract.<ref name=MIC/>

Despite this auspicious start to his career, Shearer was only eased into the first team gradually and made just ten goalless appearances for the club the [[1988–89 in English football|following season]]. Throughout his career Shearer was recognised for his strength,<ref name=SL>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/nationwide1/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/06/02/17/SOCCER_Southampton_Nightlead.html |title=Lundekvam Relishing Shearer Battle |access-date=15 August 2008 |work=Sporting Life |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604215447/https://www.sportinglife.com/football/nationwide1/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer%2F06%2F02%2F17%2FSOCCER_Southampton_Nightlead.html |archive-date=4 June 2011 }}</ref> which, during his time at Southampton, enabled him to retain the ball and provide opportunities for teammates.<ref name =ITN199/> Playing as a lone striker between wide men, [[Rod Wallace]] and [[Matt Le Tissier]], Shearer scored three goals in 26 appearances in the [[1989–90 in English football|1989–90 season]],<ref name = ITN577>{{cite book | author=Holley & Chalk | title=In That Number | year=2003|page=577 }}</ref> and in [[1990–91 in English football|the next]], four goals in 36 games. His performances in the centre of the ''Saints'' attack were soon recognised by the fans, who voted him their Player of the Year for [[1990–91 in English football|1991]].<ref name=MIC/><ref name = ITN577/>

In the middle of 1991, Shearer was a member of the [[England national under-21 football team|England national under-21 football squad]] in the [[Toulon Tournament]] in [[Toulon]], France. Shearer was the star of the tournament where he scored seven goals in four games.<ref name = ITN577/> It was during the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92 season]] that Shearer rose to national prominence. 13 goals in 41 appearances for the ''Saints'' led to an [[England national football team|England]] call-up;<ref name=NUFC>{{cite web|url=http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Profiles/0,,10278~5962,00.html |title=Profile – Alan Shearer |access-date=24 July 2008 |publisher=Newcastle United F.C |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206025703/http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Profiles/0%2C%2C10278~5962%2C00.html |archive-date=6 February 2008 }}</ref> he scored on his debut,<ref name= farewell>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/euro2000/teams/england/799370.stm|title=Sad Farewell for Shearer|access-date=15 August 2008|work=BBC Sport|date=20 June 2000|archive-date=3 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220203044438/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/euro2000/teams/england/799370.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> and was strongly linked in the press with a summer move to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. A possible move for Shearer was being mentioned in the media during late autumn of 1991, but he rejected talk of a transfer and vowed to see out the season with Southampton, resisting the temptation of a possible transfer to the two clubs who headed the title race for most of the season. Speculation of a transfer to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], who finished the season as FA Cup winners, also came to nothing.<ref name=MIC/>

During the middle of 1992, Southampton's manager, [[Ian Branfoot]], became "the most popular manager in English football", as he took telephone calls from clubs "trying to bargain with players they don't want plus cash". Although Branfoot accepted that a sale was inevitable, he claimed that "whatever happens, we are in the driving seat".<ref name =ITN224>Quoted in {{cite book | author=Holley & Chalk | title=In That Number | year=2003|page=224 }}</ref> In July 1992, Shearer was sold to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for a fee of £3.6 million, with [[David Speedie]] reluctantly moving to The Dell as part of the deal. Despite Branfoot's claim to be "in the driving seat", ''Saints'' failed to include a "sell-on clause" in the contract. Shearer, less than a month off his 22nd birthday, was the most expensive player in British football.<ref>{{cite book | author=Holley & Chalk | title=In That Number | year=2003|page=224 }}</ref> In his four years in the Southampton first team, Shearer made a total of 158 appearances in all competitions, scoring 43 goals.<ref name = ITN577/>

Returning to fitness for the [[1993–94 Blackburn Rovers F.C. season|1993–94 season]], he scored 31 goals from 40 games as Blackburn finished runners-up in the [[1993–94 FA Premier League|Premier League]].<ref name=NUFC/> His performances for the club led to him being named the [[FWA Footballer of the Year|Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]] for that season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballwriters.co.uk/awards/footballer-of-the-year/|title=FWA FOOTBALLER OF THE YEAR AWARD|access-date=25 July 2008|publisher=Football Writers' Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919074938/http://www.footballwriters.co.uk/awards/footballer-of-the-year/|archive-date=19 September 2008}}</ref> On the international scene, England had failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup finals,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1632000/1632224.stm|title=USA 1994|access-date=13 August 2008|work=BBC Sport|date=17 April 2002|archive-date=3 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103205635/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1632000/1632224.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> but Shearer added three more goals to his international tally before embarking on his most successful domestic season as a player to date.<ref name=MIC2/>

{{blockquote|"I know at first hand how fierce the gladiatorial battles are between a striker and defenders.

After a match against Juventus I met Alex Del Piero who like myself could only speak in the most glowing of terms about Shearer. He'd terrorised the Juve defenders when the clubs met in Newcastle. They found him one of the most difficult opponents they had ever faced. The coach Marcello Lippi had been purring about Shearer's performance.
