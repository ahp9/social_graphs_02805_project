'''Anthony Keith Book''' (4 September 1934 – 13 January 2025) was an English [[Association football|football]] player and coach who played as a [[right-back]]. Book spent a large part of his career in [[Non-League football]] with his home town club [[Bath City F.C.|Bath City]] as well as other local sides [[Peasedown Miners Welfare F.C.|Peasedown Miners]] and [[Frome Town FC]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.northdevongazette.co.uk/news/sport/1702417/argyle-icon-tony-book-passes-away.html | title=Argyle icon Tony Book passes away | date=14 January 2025 }}</ref> before entering league football with [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]]. At the age of 31, he joined [[Football League First Division|First Division]] [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], where he became captain. Under Book's [[Captain (association football)|captaincy]], Manchester City won four major trophies, making him the second-most decorated Manchester City captain of all-time. Book had a five-year tenure as Manchester City manager from 1974 to 1979, and subsequently held various coaching roles at the club until 1996. According to Book's former teammate [[Mike Summerbee]], [[George Best]] described Book as his "most difficult opponent".<ref>{{Cite news |date=14 January 2025 |title=Tony Book, Manchester City title winner and 'club legend', dies aged 90 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/14/tony-book-manchester-city-dies-aged-90 |access-date=14 January 2025 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>

==Early life and non-league career==
Book was born in Bath, but at the age of four moved to India when his father, an officer in the [[Somerset Light Infantry]], was posted.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Book|first1= Tony|first2= David |last2=Clayton| title= Maine Man | page=21|publisher=Mainstream publishing |year= 2004 |isbn= 1-84018-812-X}}</ref> During World War II, Book's father served in [[Burma]], and Book lived with his mother and brothers in army quarters in a number of places in [[British India]], including [[Mumbai]] and [[Multan]]. In September 1945, the Book family returned to England. Tony started secondary school in Bath, and gained his first experience in competitive football when he was selected to play for both Bath boys and Somerset boys.<ref name ="Penney">{{cite book | last=Penney|first= Ian |  title=The Legends of Manchester City |  publisher=Breedon Books |  year=2002 |   isbn=1-85983-326-8 }}</ref>

After leaving school at 16, Book became an apprentice [[bricklayer]] and played amateur football as an inside-forward for [[Peasedown Miners Welfare F.C.|Peasedown Miners]], until he was called up for [[national service]] in 1952.<ref>''Maine Man'' 32–33</ref> While playing for his army team Book converted to the [[full-back (association football)|full-back]] position and had a trial with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] courtesy of a recommendation from army teammate [[Frank Blunstone]], but was not taken on.<ref>{{cite book |last= James|first= Gary| title= The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame | page=30|publisher=Hamlyn |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-600-61282-1}}</ref>

After completing his national service, Book returned to his bricklaying job in Bath and started playing for [[Frome Town F.C.|Frome Town]].<ref name="Penney"/> During the 1955–56 season Frome suffered financial difficulties, and sent letters to all their players permitting them to leave if they wished. Book showed his letter to a colleague, who played for [[Bath City F.C.|Bath City]] of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. He in turn informed the Bath chairman, and Book signed for the club in January 1956.<ref name ="MAY">{{cite book | last=Penney|first= Ian |  title=Manchester City: The Mercer-Allison Years |  publisher=Breedon Books |  year=2008 |   isbn=978-1-85983-608-8 }} p29</ref> He spent seven and a half years at Bath, becoming captain in the latter part of his Bath career, and winning the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] title in 1960. In the 1962 close season, [[Malcolm Allison]] became Bath manager, beginning a long association between the two.

==Professional career==
At the close of the [[1962–63 in English football|1962–63 season]], Allison received an offer to coach Canadian team [[Toronto City]] over the summer and took Book with him. Though Allison left after a short time to take up a position at [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], Book stayed three months, in which time he was voted the best full-back in Canada.<ref>{{cite web| title=Tony Book| work=Manchester City Supporters Homepage| url=http://www.uit.no/mancity/players/old/book.html| access-date=10 January 2007| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://archive.today/20120913223116/http://www.uit.no/mancity/players/old/book.html| archive-date=13 September 2012}}</ref>

Upon his return to England, Book was signed for Plymouth by Allison for a fee of £1,500, and Book entered [[the Football League]] for the first time at the age of 30, though Plymouth believed him to be 28&nbsp;– Allison had advised Book to doctor his birth certificate as he thought the Plymouth board would not pay £1,500 for a 30-year-old.<ref>''Maine Man'', p46</ref> After making 81 league appearances, Book followed Malcolm Allison again to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] two years later, this time for a transfer fee of £17,000.<ref name="Heroes">{{cite web | title=Tony Book|work=Football Heroes| url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=3817| access-date=14 August 2007}}</ref> Manager [[Joe Mercer]] was initially reluctant to spend such a fee on a player over 30 years old, but was persuaded after Allison pointed out that Mercer's career had included a successful move at a similar age, when he joined [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] aged 32.<ref name="hof31">''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p30</ref>

Book prospered under the management of Mercer and Allison. He made his Manchester City debut in the opening match of the [[1966–67 in English football|1966–67 season]], a 1–1 draw with [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]],<ref name="Heroes"/> and became a near-permanent fixture in the team. In his first season at the club he missed just one game,<ref name="Clayton">{{cite book |last=Clayton |first=David |title=Everything under the blue moon: the complete book of Manchester City F.C.&nbsp;– and more! |publisher=Mainstream publishing |location=Edinburgh |year=2002 |isbn=1-84018-687-9}} p35</ref> becoming the inaugural winner of the club's ''Player of the Year'' award<ref>{{cite book | editor-first=Julian |editor-last=Baskcomb | title=Manchester City Official Handbook 1995–96 | publisher=Polar| year=1995}}</ref> in a season in which the club consolidated their position following promotion.

In the 1967 close season, Book was named captain following the transfer of previous captain [[Johnny Crossan]] to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], and was henceforth nicknamed ''Skip'' by his teammates. His first season as captain was a very successful one, leading Manchester City to their second [[English football champions|league championship]] while playing every game. An [[Achilles tendon|Achilles]] injury sidelined Book for the first four months of the [[1968–69 in English football|1968–69 season]], but he returned to the team in time for the start of their [[FA Cup]] run. In the week preceding the cup final, Book was named the 1969 [[Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]] Award, sharing the accolade with [[Dave Mackay]].<ref name="Completerecord">{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City&nbsp;– The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2006 |isbn=1-85983-512-0}} p180</ref> The following Saturday Manchester City played [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]] in the [[FA Cup Final 1969|FA Cup final]]. Manchester City won 1–0, and captain Book lifted the trophy. The following season City became the first English team to win a European and domestic trophy in the same season, the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] and the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]. Book retired from playing in 1974,<ref name="Clayton"/> passing the captaincy to [[Colin Bell (footballer, born 1946)|Colin Bell]]. He made 242 football league appearances for the club, and for many years was City's most successful captain in terms of trophies won.

==Management career==
In November 1973, Manchester City manager [[Johnny Hart (English footballer)|Johnny Hart]] resigned due to ill health, and Book took temporary responsibility for first-team affairs, and was named assistant manager when [[Ron Saunders]] became the next permanent manager. At this point Book retired from playing to concentrate on management. Saunders was sacked after less than six months, and Book again took on the caretaker role, and was appointed permanent manager one game later. The first notable victory of Book's management was a 1–0 [[Manchester derby]] win, best known for the back-heel scored by [[Denis Law]].<ref name="hof37">''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p37</ref> Book's first full season as manager resulted in an eighth-place finish, an improvement upon the previous season, when the team finished 14th.<ref name="hof37"/>

In 1976, Book's City side won the [[League Cup]], making him the first person to win the competition as both player and manager.<ref name="mcm" /> City continued their run of form into the following season, enjoying an impressive league campaign where they finished in second place, only a point behind winners [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].<ref name="mcm" /> City were playing entertaining football in the late 1970s and regularly drawing crowds at [[Maine Road]] in excess of 40,000.<ref name="mcm" /> Book remained manager until 1979, when he was replaced by his former mentor Malcolm Allison. In 1981 he was invited by new manager John Bond to look after Youth Development at the club. In 1986 working with another City legend, [[Glyn Pardoe]], they coached a young City side that would win the [[FA Youth Cup]] for the first time that year. He then became a loyal stalwart to the club in several other roles until 1997, including as caretaker manager again in 1993.<ref>[https://www.soccerbase.com/managers/manager.sd?manager_id=1241 Soccerbase: Tony Book's managerial career]</ref> He joined [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in 1997 as Chief Scout under [[Brian Horton]].

==Later life and death==
As of 2008 Book was retired, but still held two honorary positions; he was Honorary President of Manchester City<ref>{{cite web|title=Club Directors and Officials |work=Manchester City official website |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pagegid={F4F3FD8C-326D-49EE-A2E1-B8E9D6A47D3B} |access-date=14 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808012149/http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pagegid=%7BF4F3FD8C-326D-49EE-A2E1-B8E9D6A47D3B%7D |archive-date= 8 August 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Life President of the Manchester City Official Supporters Club.<ref>{{cite web| title=About the OSC| work=Manchester City Official Supporters Club| url=http://www.mcfcosc.com/about| access-date=14 August 2007| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822230459/http://www.mcfcosc.com/about| archive-date=22 August 2007}}</ref> He was inducted into Manchester City's ''Hall of Fame'' in January 2004.<ref>
