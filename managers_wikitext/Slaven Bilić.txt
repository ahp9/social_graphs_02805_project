Bilić, who played as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]], began his career in 1988 with his hometown club [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]], later having successful spells with [[Karlsruher SC]] in Germany, and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in England before retiring from active football in 2001. At the international level, Bilić served as one of [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]'s most consistent defenders during the tenure of coach [[Miroslav Blažević]], earning 44 caps between 1992 and 1999. 

Following his retirement as a player in 2001 at Hajduk Split, Bilić coached the team in the second half of the [[2001–02 Prva HNL|2001–02 season]]. Between 2004 and 2006, he managed the [[Croatia national under-21 football team|Croatia national under-21 team]], before taking over the senior national side.

== Club career ==

=== Early life and Hajduk Split ===
Almost all Hajduk juniors attended local high schools. As there were no classical grammar schools in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], Bilić enrolled in an information, journalism and documentary (INDOK) studies program. All throughout high school, Bilić was a top student in his class and graduated by completing [[Matura]]. His favorite subjects were [[mathematics]] and [[history]]. The year he enrolled in a university program, he already had excellent prospects to build a career as a football player. However, he still decided to attend university and later graduated from the [[:hr:Pravni fakultet u Splitu|law faculty in Split]] where his father acted as dean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/arhiva/s-cetiri-godine-prestao-je-govoriti-ali-mana-je-postala-njegova-pobjeda/3924660/ |title=S četiri godine prestao je govoriti, ali mana je postala njegova pobjeda |date=24 April 2008 |work=[[Jutarnji list]] |language=hr |access-date=9 June 2017}}</ref>

As a Hajduk player, he was on loan for half a year at [[NK Primorac 1929|NK Primorac]], and for 18 months at [[HNK Šibenik]], which, that season, finished fifth in the [[Yugoslav Second League]], barely missing promotion to the top flight<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.index.hr/xmag/clanak/tuzan-trenutak-za-proslavu-80-godina-kluba-hnl-nije-isti-bez-sibenika/653022.aspx |title=Tužan trenutak za proslavu 80 godina kluba: "HNL nije isti bez Šibenika" |date=19 December 2012 |work=[[Index.hr]] |language=hr}}</ref> Bilić, as centre half, scored seven goals in the championship. He also played for the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia national team]], having been called up by [[Petar Nadoveza]] for three matches in which he then scored two goals and was declared man of the match in all three.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vecernji.hr/sport/petar-nadoveza-jos-kao-klinac-slaven-bilic-tocno-je-znao-sto-zeli-1059521 |title=Petar Nadoveza: Bilić je još kao klinac točno znao što želi|date=12 February 2016 |work=[[Večernji list]] |language=hr |access-date=9 June 2017}}</ref>

Bilić was then targeted by other clubs in the league, including [[Dinamo Zagreb]], [[Red Star Belgrade]] and [[FK Partizan|Partizan]]. However, he decided to stay with Hajduk which finished third in the [[1989–90 Yugoslav First League|1989–90]] season and won the [[1990–91 Yugoslav Cup|1990–91]] cup competition. During the first season of the newly founded [[Croatian First Football League|Croatian First League]], Hajduk won both the league and the [[1992 Croatian Football Super Cup|Super Cup]]. The following season, the club also secured its first [[Croatian Football Cup|Croatian Cup]] title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hajduk.hr/povijest/1991-2000 |title=1991–2000 |date=12 February 2016 |publisher=[[HNK Hajduk Split]] |language=hr |access-date=9 June 2017}}</ref>

=== West Ham United ===
In January 1996, [[Harry Redknapp]], manager of [[Premier League]] club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], brought Bilić to the club for a fee of [[Pound sterling|£]]1.3 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=8828 | publisher = soccerbase.com |title=The Internet Soccer Database |access-date=18 February 2007}}</ref> setting the new club record for highest fee paid for an incoming player. Bilić made his debut on 12 February 1996 in a 0–1 away win against London rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. The goal for West Ham came after Bilić's shot had been saved by Tottenham goalkeeper [[Ian Walker (footballer)|Ian Walker]] and the ball then diverted into Tottenham goal by another West Ham debutant, [[Daniel da Cruz Carvalho|Dani]].<ref name="whustats">{{cite web|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&ham=50&united=Slaven_Bilic |title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics&nbsp;– Slaven Bilic |website=www.westhamstats.info |access-date=24 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-dani-buoys-west-ham-on-debut-1318853.html |title=Football: Dani buoys West Ham on debut |work=The Independent |date=13 February 1996 |access-date=24 March 2015 |last=Moore |first=Glenn}}</ref>

He played 13 games in the [[1995–96 West Ham United F.C. season|1995–96 season]] and 41 in the [[1996–97 West Ham United F.C. season|1996–97 season]] in which he scored three goals (two in the [[1996-97 Premier League|Premier League]], against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]], and one in the [[1996–97 Football League Cup|League Cup]], against [[Barnet F.C|Barnet]])<ref name=whustats/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BILIC+GETS+ON+HIS+BIKE+TO+SAVE+HAMMERS.-a061339841 |title=Bilic gets on his bike to save Hammers |website=www.freelibrary.com |access-date=24 March 2015}}</ref> and was voted runner-up, to [[Julian Dicks]], for the [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|Hammer of the Year]] award.<ref name=whustats/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whufc.com.p.preprod.performgroup.com/articles/20080511/green-is-hammer-of-the-year_2236884_1310012 |title=Green is Hammer of the Year |website=www.whufc.com |access-date=24 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402103222/http://www.whufc.com.p.preprod.performgroup.com/articles/20080511/green-is-hammer-of-the-year_2236884_1310012 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In March 1997, [[Joe Royle]] brokered Bilić's £4.5 million move to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], with Bilić requesting to stay with West Ham until the end of the season and help club's efforts to avoid relegation.<ref name="efc">{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2013/09/20/club-connector-slaven-bilic |title=Club Connector:Slaven Bilic |website=www.evertonfc.com |access-date=24 March 2015 |archive-date=16 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916042024/http://www.evertonfc.com/news/2013/09/20/club-connector-slaven-bilic |url-status=dead }}</ref> West Ham finished the season in 14th place, two points outside the relegation zone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&ham=1997&united=Premier_League_1996-97 |title=Premier League 1996–97 |website=www.westhamstas.info |access-date=24 March 2015}}</ref>

=== Everton ===
Bilić first played for Everon in August 1997, with full support of the new manager [[Howard Kendall]]. He initially brought some class to the Toffees' backline, but his season was marred by bookings that saw him miss several games due to suspensions.<ref name=efc/>

After the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], Bilić developed a nagging groin strain, and returned to Croatia for treatment.<ref name=efc/> After missing the first quarter of the season, he was left wondering if he would get back into Everton's first eleven, now managed by [[Walter Smith]]. He did so and showed some good form, but never fully re-established himself due to injuries and suspensions.<ref name=efc/> Subsequently, Everton released Bilić in July 1999.

=== Hajduk Split ===
Two days after being released by Everton, Bilić signed for his home club [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]], where he played briefly before retiring.<ref name=efc/> He led Hajduk as team captain to their first trophy in five years, winning the Croatian Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20000517/sport.htm |title=KUP JE NAŠ! |date=17 July 2000 |work=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]] |language=hr |access-date=9 June 2017}}</ref>

== International career ==
On 5 July 1992, Bilić made his international debut for the [[Croatia national football team]] in a [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] against [[Australia men's national soccer team|Australia]] at the [[Olympic Park Stadium (Melbourne)|Olympic Park Stadium]], where Croatia lost lost 0–1.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/players/slaven-bilic-8055/ |title=Slaven Bilic International matches |date=9 June 2017 |website=11v11|access-date=9 June 2017}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=September 2025}} At the [[UEFA Euro 1996]], he played in all four matches as Croatia secured a respectable spot in the Top 8, losing to [[Germany national football team|Germany]] 1–2 in the quarterfinals.{{Citation needed|date=September 2025}}

At the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], Croatia became the biggest surprise of the tournament. The team only lost two matches, against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the group stage (0–1) and [[France national football team|France]] in the semifinals (1–2). After winning the play-off match against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], Croatia finished the tournament in third place.<ref name="efc" /> Bilić played in all seven matches and was involved in a controversy for the role he played in the dismissal of [[Laurent Blanc]] in the semifinal against France. With Croatia behind, a free-kick was awarded, which saw Bilić marking and holding the French defender. Wanting to rescue himself, Blanc pushed Bilić, making contact with his chin and chest. Bilić fell to the ground clutching his forehead. Bilić later admitted to overacting and going down only after encouraged to do so by teammate [[Igor Štimac]]. Blanc was sent off and missed the World Cup final due to suspension.<ref name=efc/> Bilić never officially apologize, but stated: "I swear, if I could change that moment, so that Blanc could have played in the final, I would."<ref name="The Independent 2006-10-11">{{cite web|first=Sam Wallace |last=Wallace |title=Croatian rocker who wants to roll over Rooney |date=11 October 2006|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/internationals/croatian-rocker-who-wants-to-roll-over-rooney-419478.html |newspaper=The Independent|publisher=Independent News & Media|access-date=15 January 2016 |location=London}}</ref>

== Managerial career ==

=== Early days ===
In, 2001, as a shareholder of his hometown club, [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]], he agreed to temporarily manage the team until the club could find a replacement manager. He stated that the adrenaline rush he experienced during this period inspired him, and reportedly sought and received guidance from [[Arsène Wenger]] and [[Marcello Lippi]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jun/01/croatiafootballteam.euro2008groupb |title=Fire in Bilic burns bright |publisher=Guardian |date=1 June 2008 |access-date=26 January 2010 |location=London |first=Jamie |last=Jackson}}</ref>

=== Croatia ===
Bilić was appointed head coach of the [[Croatia national football team|senior national team]] on 25 July 2006, succeeding [[Zlatko Kranjčar]] after the unsuccessful [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. His assistants included former teammates [[Aljoša Asanović]], [[Robert Prosinečki]], [[Nikola Jurčević]], and [[Marjan Mrmić]]. One of his first actions was the promotion of three players from the under-21 squad: [[Eduardo da Silva|Eduardo]], [[Luka Modrić]], and [[Vedran Ćorluka]], all of whom eventually built impressive careers. The team's first official game under Bilić was the 2–0 win in an away friendly match against [[Italy national football team|Italy]], while Bilić's first competitive game was the goalless draw in [[Moscow]] against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in the opener of the [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying|Euro 2008 qualifying campaign]]. Many criticized this result due to Bilić's suspension of [[Darijo Srna]], [[Ivica Olić]] and [[Boško Balaban]], who left the team camp three days before the match for an evening at a night club in [[Zagreb]]. They assumed no-one would find out, but that very evening a gunfight broke out at that very night club, and the police had to intervene. Even though none of the players were involved in the incident, their absence from the team camp resulted in a scandal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/srna--balaban-i-olic-zbog-odlaska-na-narodnjake-suspendirani-za-moskvu-/153158/ |title=Srna, Balaban i Olić zbog odlaska na narodnjake suspendirani za Moskvu! |language=hr |work=Jutarnji list |date=3 September 2006 |access-date=23 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222085240/http://www.jutarnji.hr/srna--balaban-i-olic-zbog-odlaska-na-narodnjake-suspendirani-za-moskvu-/153158/ |archive-date=22 December 2015}}</ref>

In the continuation of the Euro 2008 qualifiers, Bilić led Croatia with great success. In a group consisting of [[England national football team|England]], Russia, [[Israel national football team|Israel]], [[North Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]], [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], and [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]], Croatia secured the top spot in [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying#Group E|Group E]], with notable wins against England both home and away. England ended up missing Euro 2008, and their manager [[Steve McClaren]] was sacked.<ref name=autogenerated1 />
[[File:Slaven Bilic dres HNS 300410 1.jpg|thumb|Bilić at the presentation of Croatia's new kit, April 2010]]
At the [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] tournament itself, where he was the youngest coach, Bilić's squad had to deal with the absence of star striker Eduardo who had sustained a serious injury a few months earlier. Nonetheless, Bilić led his side to an outstanding achievement, as Croatia won all three group stage games of the competition, including the match against the eventual finalists [[German national football team|Germany]]. Over night, the media labelled Croatia favourites to win the tournament, however, the team suffered an abrupt exit in the quarterfinals against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. Bilić has since stated that this defeat would haunt him for the rest of his life.<ref>{{cite web|author=Football 2010 |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/this-will-haunt-us-for-the-rest-of-our-lives-weeps-devastated-lionheart-bilic-1417789.html |title='This will haunt us for the rest of our lives,' weeps devastated lionheart Bilic |publisher=Independent.ie |date=21 June 2008 |access-date=26 January 2010}}</ref>

At [[UEFA Euro 2012]], Croatia won against [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]], drew against Italy, and lost 0–1 to [[Spain national football team|Spain]], exiting the tournament at the group stage. However, the team garnered widespread praise for their performance, and were greeted by a large crowd upon their return to Zagreb. Upon his formal departure as national coach, Bilić was praised for his long-standing service and successess. Domestic media outlet ''[[Jutarnji list]]'' labelled him as Croatia's first manager to leave the team on a positive note and credited him for the team's revival during his six-year tenure.<ref name="Jutarnji List"/>

=== Lokomotiv Moscow ===
On 14 May 2012, it was confirmed that Bilić had signed a coaching contract with the Russian club [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]].<ref name="loko">{{cite web |publisher=[[FC Lokomotiv Moscow]] |url=http://www.fclm.ru/ru/info/news/index.php?id_4=16651 |script-title=ru:Славен Билич – новый главный тренер "Локомотива" |date=14 May 2012 |language=ru |access-date=14 May 2012 |archive-date=15 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515021930/http://www.fclm.ru/ru/info/news/index.php?id_4=16651 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Club chairman, Olga Smorodskaya, stated that Lokomotiv had tough competition in their attempt to signing Bilić, as he was targeted by many other clubs from across Europe.<ref>{{cite news|title=Predsjednica Lokomotiva: Za Bilića smo se borili s klubovima iz Premiershipa |url=http://www.index.hr/euro-2012/clanak/bilic-i-cijeli-strucni-stozer-put-moskve-mozda-nije-trenutak-ali-potpisao-sam-ugovor-s-lokomotivom/614907.aspx |access-date=26 February 2013 |language=hr |date=14 May 2012 |work=Index.hr}}</ref> Bilić again joined forces with former teammates and former assistants, Aljoša Asanović and Nikola Jurčević, who again acted as his assistants.

His first official match as the new Lokomotiv manager came was an away 3–2 win against [[Mordoviya Saransk]] on 20 July 2012. Bilić's first season at the club ended with Lokomotiv's worst league result (ninth place) since the establishment of Russian championship in 1992.
