'''Roy Leslie McFarland''' (born 5 April 1948) is an English former [[association football|football]] [[coach (sport)|manager]] and player. With [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], he played 442 league games, helping him to earn 28 [[cap (sport)|caps]] for [[England national football team|England]].

Born in Liverpool, McFarland developed his skills at [[Tranmere Rovers]], before stints at Derby County and [[Bradford City]]. Under the management duo of [[Brian Clough]] and [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]], he was instrumental in Derby County's ascendancy to the First Division in 1969, subsequently leading them to league triumphs in 1972 and 1975, albeit his contribution was limited in the latter due to injury. Internationally, McFarland represented England, earning 28 caps and participating in notable matches, including a contentious encounter with Poland's [[Włodzimierz Lubański]] in 1973.

Transitioning to management, McFarland began as player-manager at Bradford City in 1981, guiding them to promotion from the Fourth Division. His managerial career spanned several clubs, including Derby County, [[Bolton Wanderers]], [[Cambridge United]], [[Torquay United]], [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]], and a caretaker role at [[Burton Albion]], where he led them to Football League promotion. McFarland's influence extended beyond coaching, culminating in his appointment to the Derby County board of directors in 2017.

==Playing career==
Born in [[Liverpool]], McFarland was a player for [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]]. He represented [[England national football team|England]] at full international level. [[Brian Clough]] and [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1928)|Peter Taylor]] signed him for Derby on 25 August 1967, three months after taking charge at Derby County, when they were rebuilding a side to gain promotion to the first division.

He was famous during the late 1960s and 1970s as a central defender in the Derby side which won promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1969 and followed this success with two league titles; the first under Clough in 1972 and the second under [[Dave Mackay]] in 1975, though injury meant he was only able to make four appearances during the latter campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gameofthepeople.com/2015/03/09/we-are-the-champions-1974-75-derby-county/|title=We are the Champions: 1974-75 – Derby County|publisher=gameofthepeople.com|date=9 March 2015 |access-date=18 May 2016}}</ref> He also won 28 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for England.

He is noted for having the earliest known booking for time wasting when he humorously kicked the ball out of play after Derby had taken the lead against Liverpool in a game Derby were very unlikely to win.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beachballgate: which other teams have suffered from 'outside agents'? {{!}} The Knowledge |date=2009-10-21 |website=[[The Guardian]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221208054438/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/21/beach-ball-gate-the-knowledge |archive-date=2022-12-08 |url-status=live |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/21/beach-ball-gate-the-knowledge}}</ref>

McFarland had been deemed responsible for putting [[Włodzimierz Lubański]], Poland's best striker at the time, out of football for two years after an apparent poor tackle damaged Lubański's cruciate ligament during a World Cup qualifying match in June 1973. Lubanski missed the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] where Poland captured third place, but recently Lubanski himself wrote in his memoirs published in Poland that his leg was injured without McFarland's involvement as a result of an earlier injury and resultant insufficient preparation for the big game.

==Managerial career==
McFarland started his managerial career at [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] as player manager when he took over from [[George Mulhall]] in May 1981. He played 40 games for Bradford in a brief spell as manager which brought the club promotion in [[1981–82 in English football|1981–82]] via the runners-up spot in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. The season included a nine-game winning run, which was a club record at the time. McFarland's reign was a launchpad for the club during the 1980s but he left in controversial circumstances with allegations former club [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] had tapped up him and assistant [[Mick Jones (footballer, born 1947)|Mick Jones]]. Derby eventually had to pay a large fine and compensation for taking the pair back to the [[Baseball Ground]].<ref>{{cite book

He became assistant manager at the club during [[Arthur Cox (footballer)|Arthur Cox]]'s reign as manager, and was promoted to the manager's seat when Cox quit in October 1993.

McFarland lasted two seasons as Derby manager, with significant amounts of money having been spent on the team.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In his first season, they reached the Division One play-off final but lost 2–1 to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. They missed out on the playoffs a year later and McFarland moved to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].

Bolton had just been promoted to the [[Premier League]] under previous manager [[Bruce Rioch]], and McFarland was unable to establish them at this level despite making several new signings. He was dismissed in January 1996 after just six months in charge, with Bolton bottom of the Premiership and heading for [[relegation]].

McFarland's next management job came at [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]], where he arrived just before Christmas in 1996. In his third season, [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99]], they won promotion as [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] runners-up. He remained in charge for two years before being replaced by John Beck in February 2001.<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1192429.stm Cambridge sack McFarland]</ref>

He took over as manager of [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] in July 2001, but resigned in April 2002 after Torquay chairman [[Mike Bateson]] decided that if McFarland was to have an assistant he had to have a playing one, meaning McFarland's assistant [[David Preece (footballer born 1963)|David Preece]] had to leave as he had just retired as a player.

From June 2003 to March 2007, McFarland was manager of [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] and did well to keep the club in the third tier of the league, with Chesterfield's severe lack of resources, when most pundits have tipped them for relegation. He left the club after the poor set of results on 12 March 2007,<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chesterfield/6442683.stm McFarland leaves struggling Chesterfield]</ref> leaving caretaker boss Lee Richardson to try and save the struggling Chesterfield.

In 2009, after a spell out of football McFarland was appointed the caretaker manager until the end of the 2008–09 season of [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] on 6 January, filling the gap created by [[Nigel Clough]] who had moved along the A38 to McFarland's former club Derby County earlier in the day.<ref>{{cite news
