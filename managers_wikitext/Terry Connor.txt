'''Terence Fitzroy Connor''' (born 9 November 1962) is an English football coach currently coaching at Walsall FC and former professional [[association football|footballer]].

He was born in [[Leeds]] and was a pupil at [[Foxwood School (Seacroft)|Foxwood School]], [[Seacroft]], Leeds.<ref>Foxwood School's Jubilee Brochure, 1980</ref> As a player, Connor scored 91 goals from 358 games in [[the Football League]] as a [[striker (association football)|striker]] playing for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/player2/terryconnor.html |title=Terry Connor |work=UK A–Z Transfers |publisher=Neil Brown |access-date=23 July 2010}}</ref> He was [[Cap (sport)|capped]] once for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 team]].

He moved into coaching following his playing retirement, briefly working as a coach at both [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] and [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] before joining Wolves in 1999. After holding a variety of positions he served as Wolves' manager for thirteen games during [[2011–12 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|their Premier League relegation in 2012]].

==Playing career==
Connor scored on his senior debut for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] aged 17, in a 1–0 win over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 17 November 1979. He made 108 appearances in total for Leeds over four seasons, scoring 22 goals. He joined [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] in exchange for Andy Ritchie, in March 1983. However, he was unable to appear in their [[1983 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] appearance just months later as he was already [[cup-tied]]. The club ended the season relegated. The majority of Connor's games for Brighton came in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. His form here won him an [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] cap in November 1986, when he played and scored against [[FR Yugoslavia national under-21 football team|Yugoslavia under-21]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablese/eng-u21-intres86.html |title=England – U-21 International Results 1986–1995 – Details |date=10 January 2004 |first=Barrie |last=Courtney |website=[[RSSSF]] |access-date=23 July 2010}}</ref> He scored 51 goals in 156 appearances before leaving Brighton as they dropped into the third tier in 1987. One of his most memorable goals for Brighton came when they knocked [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] out of the [[1983-84 FA Cup]], a season in which Liverpool won the [[Football League Cup]], [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] and were crowned [[Football League First Division|English champions]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lfchistory.net/SeasonArchive/Game/1379 |title=Brighton v Liverpool |publisher=lfchistory.net |access-date=26 February 2018}}</ref> He moved along the South Coast to sign for [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in a £200,000 deal.

Portsmouth were newly promoted to the First Division at the time of Connor's arrival, but despite his goals they were relegated after just one season. He remained at [[Fratton Park]] for three seasons before joining [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] for £150,000 in August 1990. After a solitary full season with the Swans in the third tier, he moved to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] in September 1991. He failed to make much impact at Bristol City, playing just 16 times and scoring once; he was also briefly loaned back to Swansea in autumn 1992. He dropped into [[non-League football]] in summer 1993 when he signed for [[Conference National|Conference]] club [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]].

==Coaching career==

===Early roles===
After retiring, he became one of the coaching staff at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]]. Later, Connor and family friend Maurice Gardner turned to coaching, working under [[John Ward (footballer, born 1951)|John Ward]] at [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], before moving across the city to work at [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10327~676202,00.html |title=Connor is coach target |date=21 June 2005 |publisher=Bristol City F.C}}</ref>

===Move to Wolves===
After John Ward moved to become assistant manager at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], he recruited Connor to their coaching staff in August 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewolvessite.co.uk/staff.htm |title=Men in Suits, all the staff at Molineux |access-date=8 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215201147/http://www.thewolvessite.co.uk/staff.htm |archive-date=15 February 2012}} The Wolves Site – Staff</ref>

Connor served as a coach – at youth, reserve and first team level – under a succession of Wolves' managers before being promoted to assistant manager under [[Mick McCarthy]] in August 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birminghampost.net/midlands-birmingham-sport/west-midlands-sports/wolves-fc/2008/08/05/terry-connor-promoted-to-assistant-manager-at-wolves-65233-21464731/ |title=Terry Connor promoted to assistant manager at Wolves |first=Lisa |last=Smith |work=Birmingham Post |date=5 August 2008 |access-date=23 July 2010 |archive-date=21 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521233907/http://www.birminghampost.net/midlands-birmingham-sport/west-midlands-sports/wolves-fc/2008/08/05/terry-connor-promoted-to-assistant-manager-at-wolves-65233-21464731/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Promotion to manager====
In February 2012, he was given the role of manager by Wolves until the end of the current season, after the sacking of Mick McCarthy.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/feb/24/terry-connor-appointed-wolves-manager | title=Terry Connor appointed Wolves manager until end of the season | work=The Guardian | date=24 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Terry Connor named Wolves manager until end of season|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17153404|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=24 February 2012}}</ref> chief executive Jez Moxey confirmed that the position was offered to one other candidate, widely considered by the media to be [[Alan Curbishley]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Wolves fail with second Alan Curbishley approach|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17112269|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=25 February 2012}}</ref> who refused the position before Connor was appointed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wolves chief Jez Moxey says one other turned down job|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/17166063|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=25 February 2012}}</ref> This was despite Moxey previously stating that the job would be given to an experienced manager.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wolves need experienced new boss says chief Jez Moxey|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17019094|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=13 February 2012}}</ref>

Connor took charge with Wolves in 18th place, one of five teams at the foot of the table looking to avoid the three relegation places. His first game in charge brought a 2–2 draw at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 25 February 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Newcastle 2–2 Wolves|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17093384|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=25 February 2012}}</ref> However, his side then suffered seven consecutive defeats which left them rooted to the bottom of the table and were relegated on 22 April after a 0–2 defeat to Manchester City.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wolves 0–2 Manchester City|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17718140|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=22 April 2012}}</ref> In his thirteen games, he failed to achieve any wins and gained only four points from a possible 39. The team finished bottom of the table with one of the lowest points tallies in their history (25).

In May 2012 Wolves announced that Connor would be succeeded by [[Ståle Solbakken]] as a permanent appointment during the summer.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18030227 |title=Wolves appoint Norwegian Stale Solbakken as new manager |date=11 May 2012 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref> Connor had also been interviewed for the position.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2012/05/08/wolves-interview-terry-connors-for-managers-job/ |title=Wolves interview Terry Connor for manager's job |date=8 May 2012 |publisher=[[Express & Star]]}}</ref> It was agreed that he would return to his position as assistant manager following Solbakken's appointment,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~2827879,00.html |title=Wolves confirm Lange arrival |date=30 June 2012 |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C}}</ref> but he departed after just four games of the new season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/terry-connor-leaves-wolves-030912-350048.aspx |title=Terry Connor leaves Wolves |date=3 September 2012 |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C }}{{Dead link|date=August 2025 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
