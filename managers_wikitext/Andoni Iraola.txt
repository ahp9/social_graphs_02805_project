==Managerial style==
Iraola favours a [[Formation (association football)|4–3–3/4–2–3–1 formation]] with a focus on quick ball recoveries. With quick wingers, tireless midfield runners and a defensive midfielder who tends to drop deep when building from the back when the full-backs push forward, his main emphasis is on catching the opposition off guard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com.sg/soccer/story/_/id/37625939/barcelona-xavi-six-top-young-coaches-watch-european-football|title=Barcelona's Xavi among six top young coaches to watch in European football|publisher=[[ESPN]]|last=Karlsen|first=Tor-Kristian|date=3 March 2022|access-date=1 April 2024}}</ref>
