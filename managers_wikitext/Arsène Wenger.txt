'''Arsène Charles Ernest Wenger''' (born 22 October 1949) is a French former [[association football|football]] [[Manager (association football)|manager]] and [[football player|player]] who is currently serving as [[FIFA]]'s Chief of Global Football Development. He was the manager of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] from 1996 to 2018, where he was the longest-serving and most successful in the club's history and the longest-serving in the league's history. His contribution to [[Football in England|English football]] through changes to scouting, players' training and diet regimens revitalised Arsenal and aided the globalisation of the sport in the 21st century.

Born in [[Strasbourg]] and raised in [[Duttlenheim]], Wenger was introduced to football by his father, the manager of the local village team. After a modest playing career, in which he made appearances for several amateur clubs, Wenger obtained a manager's diploma in 1981. Following an unsuccessful period at [[AS Nancy|Nancy]] in 1987, Wenger joined [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]]; the club won the league championship in [[1987–88 French Division 1|1988]] and won the [[Coupe de France]] in 1991. In 1995, he became coach of [[J.League]] side [[Nagoya Grampus Eight]] and won the [[Emperor's Cup]] and [[Japanese Super Cup]] in his first and only year.

Wenger was named manager of Arsenal in 1996; his appointment was greeted with little enthusiasm from the English media and his players alike but he became the first foreign manager to win a [[Premier League]] and [[FA Cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]] in 1998. Wenger guided Arsenal to another league and cup double in 2002 and won his third league title [[2003–04 Arsenal F.C. season|unbeaten]] in 2004 – this was the first time an English club, after [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] 115 years previously, went unbeaten. Arsenal later set the record for most league matches unbeaten (49) before [[Battle of the Buffet|losing in October 2004]]. Under him, the club made its first appearance in a [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League final]] in 2006 and relocated to the [[Emirates Stadium]]; this move caused Wenger to prioritise the club's finances to meet costs, which coincided with a nine-year spell without winning a trophy. Wenger guided Arsenal to further FA Cup successes in the 2010s; he holds the record for most wins in the competition with seven. He departed as manager in 2018 and retired.

The nickname "''Le Professeur''" is used by fans and the English press to reflect Wenger's studious demeanour. He is one of the most celebrated managers of his generation, having changed perceptions of the sport and profession in England and abroad. He has been praised for his entertaining, attacking approach to the game but his Arsenal teams were criticised for their indiscipline and naivety; his players received 100 [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|red cards]] between September 1996 and February 2014, though the team also won awards for sporting [[Sportsmanship|fair play]]. Wenger also earned a reputation for spotting young talent and developing a [[youth system]] throughout his career.

According to his father, who also managed the village team, Wenger was introduced to football "at about the age of six".<ref name="stanf">{{cite news |title=Voila votre vie!; How a postcard led to a beautiful friendship |first=David |last=Bond |page=71 |newspaper=London Evening Standard |date=15 May 1998}}</ref> He was taken to games in Germany, where he held an affection for [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]].{{sfnp|Palmer|2008|p=9}} Alsace was an area steeped in religion; Wenger and the village boys often needed to seek permission from the Catholic priest to miss [[vespers]] in order to play football.{{sfnp|Palmer|2008|pp=9–10}}

==Playing career==
Because the population of [[Duttlenheim]] was short in numbers, it proved difficult to field a team of 11 players of equal ages; Wenger did not play for FC Duttlenheim until the age of 12.{{sfnp|Palmer|2008|p=10}} Claude Wenger, a teammate of Arsène's, noted his lack of pace as a player, which he made up for with his "ability to guard the ball, [seeming] to have a complete vision of the pitch and having an influence among his team-mates", according to Marcel Brandner, the president of FC Duttlenheim.<ref name="alphonse"/> As a young teenager, he was called ''Petit''; the nickname ceased when he had a growth spurt and broke into FC Duttlenheim's first team, aged 16.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|pp=13–4}} The team did not have a coach to prepare the players tactically, rather a person who supervised training sessions.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=14}} Wenger took it upon himself to manage the side, with Claude stating "Arsène wasn't the captain and yet he was. It was 'You do this, you do that, you do this, you do that.' He was the leader".{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=14}}

[[File:Gilbert Gress, 1980.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Wenger's manager at RC Strasbourg, [[Gilbert Gress]]]]

In 1969, Wenger was recruited to nearby third division club [[AS Mutzig|Mutzig]].{{sfnp|Rees|2014|pp=15–6}} The club was famed for playing the "best amateur football" in Alsace and managed by Max Hild, who would later go on to become Wenger's mentor.<ref name="rees-guardian"/> Wenger's emergence at Mutzig aged 20 was considered too late for him to build a reputable playing career.{{sfnp|Rivoire|2011|p=18}} Football was not seen as his future; the plan was for him to run the family's spare parts business. He was, however, of the age to start increasing his tactical knowledge of the sport.{{sfnp|Rivoire|2011|p=18}} He frequently read ''[[France Football]]'' and alongside Hild made trips to Germany to watch [[Bundesliga]] matches and observe the different [[management style|managerial styles]].{{sfnp|Rivoire|2011|p=18}}{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=15}} During Wenger's three years at Mutzig, the club beat [[RC Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] 3–0 to win the Coupe d'Alsace.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=17}}<ref name=ASM>{{cite web |url=http://www.as-mutzig.fr/spip.php?rubrique2 |title=Historique |language=fr |website=AS Mutzig.fr. |access-date=7 November 2017 |archive-date=28 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828070612/http://as-mutzig.fr/spip.php?rubrique2 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=RCS /> He also represented [[Alsace]] in a competition held annually between the regional leagues.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=21}}

Wenger took his studies further, and in 1971 enrolled at the {{ill|Faculté des sciences économiques et de gestion|fr|Faculté des sciences économiques et de gestion de Strasbourg|vertical-align=sup}} (Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences) at the [[University of Strasbourg]] to read politics and economics after a brief stint in medicine.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|pp=15–6}} In 1973 he joined semi-professional club [[FC Mulhouse|Mulhouse]] and balanced his football career with his education.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=21}}{{sfnp|Rivoire|2011|p=19}} Wenger completed an economics degree{{refn|The academic degree awarded to Wenger is ambiguous.

At Mulhouse, Wenger was managed by [[Paul Frantz]], who also had a profound impact on his career. It was he who formalised Wenger's beliefs on the importance of nutrition, isometrics and working on a player's strong points.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|pp=24–5}} Wenger played in midfield for Mulhouse, often positioned on the right. In their final game of the 1974–75 season, the club beat [[AS Nancy|Nancy]] to avoid relegation, but shortly afterwards, Frantz resigned.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=26}} Wenger also made the decision to leave, as the regular commutes to Mulhouse from Strasbourg overwhelmed him.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=26}} In 1975, he rekindled his friendship with Hild and signed for amateur club [[ASPV Strasbourg]] (Vauban).{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=26}} Hild needed a midfielder "who could organise play and also have a sort of hold over the team" and decided to recruit Wenger.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=26}} Vauban was formed in 1971, and made steady progress up the French football league system thereafter; Wenger's three seasons at the club culminated with promotion to the third division.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|pp=26–7}}

[[File:Arsène Wenger, 1980, 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Wenger as a Strasbourg player in 1980]]

In 1978, Hild joined Strasbourg as coach of the reserve team.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=28}} The role required him to scout, so Hild wanted an experienced player to work with the youth while he was away.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=28}} Both Hild and Frantz recommended Wenger, which convinced manager [[Gilbert Gress]] to appoint him.{{sfnp|Rivoire|2011|p=24}} Wenger's playing career at the age of 28 began to wane, but he never anticipated a role in the first team. Working for Strasbourg, however, presented him his first full-time job at the club he supported as a young boy.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=28}} Hild moved Wenger from midfield to central defence, where he was positioned as a [[Defender (association football)#Sweeper .28libero.29|sweeper]] in reserve games.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=28}} In November 1978, he made his debut for the first team against [[MSV Duisburg]] in the [[UEFA Cup]] (a match Strasbourg lost 4–0) and a month later, Wenger played against champions [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in the First Division.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=30}} At the end of the 1978–79 season, RC Strasbourg won the [[1978–79 French Division 1|league]]; Wenger did not join in the celebrations as he was preoccupied with the youth team.{{sfnp|Rivoire|2011|p=26}} He made his final appearance for the senior side in 1979.{{sfnp|Oldfield|2010|p=13}}

Wenger spent the last two years of his playing career predominantly running Strasbourg's reserve and youth team. He became conscious of the importance of speaking English, and during his holidays enrolled on a three-week language course at the [[University of Cambridge]].{{sfnp|Palmer|2008|p=11}} Wenger also studied for his coaching badge at the {{ill|Centre de ressources, d'expertise et de performance sportives|fr|vertical-align=sup}} (CREPS) in Strasbourg – this consisted of a course to coach children, followed by an intensive six-day course which led up to the national coaching badge.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|pp=33–4}} The latter programme took place in Vichy, and was spread over three weeks, allowing Wenger to be able to put Frantz's teachings of isometrics into practice.{{sfnp|Rivoire|2011|p=27}} In 1981, he received his manager's diploma in Paris.<ref>{{cite news |title=Profile: Arsene Wenger |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/1954876.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 April 2002 |access-date=15 July 2014}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
===1984–1994: Nancy and Monaco===
Wenger's management skills at Strasbourg impressed many French coaches, and he moved to Ligue 2 club [[AS Cannes|Cannes]] in 1983, where he became [[Jean-Marc Guillou]]'s assistant.{{sfnp|Oldfield|2010|p=14}} Earning a steady wage of £300 per week, he was responsible for collecting information about opposition teams, and instilled discipline in the players through training sessions.{{sfnp|Oldfield|2010|pp=14–5}} Wenger's commitment to football was well documented; when asked what the young coach did during his spare time, general manager Richard Conte replied: "Videos, videos, videos. He was always watching videos of his opponents, of his own team. It didn't matter what time of night."{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=40}} Cannes failed to win promotion to Ligue 1, but they reached the quarter-finals of the [[Coupe de France]].{{sfnp|Oldfield|2010|p=15}} Wenger's work in raising the standard of the squad did not go unnoticed, and in 1984, he accepted Aldo Platini's offer to become manager of Nancy.{{sfnp|Palmer|2008|p=12}}

[[File:George Weah 2019 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Ballon d'Or]] winner [[George Weah]] played under Wenger at Monaco, where he won the Coupe de France.]]

The challenge of sustaining Nancy as a Ligue 1 club was difficult as Wenger inherited a squad of sub-standard quality and he was given limited money to spend.{{sfnp|Oldfield|2010|p=16}} He nevertheless relished the prospect of conducting business in the transfer market, and enjoyed freedom to trial theories he read about.{{sfnp|Oldfield|2010|p=16}} In his first season at Nancy, Wenger hired a dietician to explain the benefits of healthy eating and made it imperative that players did not snack before games.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=46}} He took the squad away from their usual summer training camp to Val Thorens, so that the players could acclimatise to the high-altitude.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=46}} Platini attested the move to their strong league starts.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=46}} From a managerial perspective, Wenger struggled to keep his emotions in check; losing made him "physically sick", to the point where he once stopped the team bus to vomit after a game.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=40}} Wenger guided the club to a respectable 12th-place finish, all the more surprising given he constantly tinkered his team.{{sfnp|Oldfield|2010|p=16}} Players were moved out of their favoured positions, which for some maximised their potential.{{sfnp|Oldfield|2010|p=16}} Éric Bertrand, a striker signed from the lower divisions, was converted into a fullback, and by the end of Wenger's time at Nancy, [[Éric Di Meco]] switched from a left winger to wing back.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=47}}

[[File:Ramón Díaz (25383125054) (2) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Argentine striker [[Ramón Díaz]] came to Monaco under Wenger in 1989.]]

Nancy's bottom-half finish proved a false dawn as the club finished 18th in the 1985–86 season, which meant they had to win a play-off match to avoid relegation. They retained their league status with a 3–2 aggregate win against Mulhouse.{{Sfnp|Rees|2014|p=48}} The club however sold several of their best players to avoid financial predicament and provided Wenger with little funds to work with.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=49}}{{sfnp| Oldfield|2010|p=17}} In Wenger's final season in charge, Nancy finished 19th and were relegated to Ligue 2.{{sfnp|Oldfield|2010|p=17}} Despite the setbacks, he was contacted by Monaco over their vacant managerial job.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=50}} Talks had begun during the summer of 1986, but Nancy chairman Gérard Rousselot refused to release Wenger from his contract, and Monaco were not prepared to offer compensation.{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=50}}<ref name="FS">{{cite web|url=https://www.footballscotland.co.uk/features/long-reads/aberdeens-eric-black-moving-metz-16123215|title=Aberdeen's Eric Black on moving to Metz and how that night in Paris was as good as Gothenburg|website=Football Scotland|date=16 April 2019|access-date=17 August 2020}}</ref> Once Nancy's relegation was confirmed, Wenger was permitted to leave the club by mutual consent and was confirmed as Monaco manager in 1987.{{sfnp|Palmer|2008|p=12}}

===Preparation===
[[File:Arsène Wenger (20064534156).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Wenger in 2015]]

Wenger regarded a well-balanced diet as an essential part of a player's preparation. He was influenced by his time in Japan, where "the whole way of life there is linked to health. Their diet is basically boiled vegetables, fish and rice. No fat, no sugar. You notice when you live there that there are no fat people".<ref name="amy">{{cite news |title=French lessons |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/oct/01/sport.comment1 |first=Amy |last=Lawrence |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |date=1 October 2006 |access-date=16 August 2012}}</ref> At Arsenal, Wenger brought in dieticians to explain the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, and acquired the help of Philippe Boixel, an [[osteopath]] for the [[France national football team|France national team]], to realign the players' bodies each month.{{sfnp|Palmer|2008|p=46}} Plyometrics, exercises designed to strengthen the muscles, were introduced and Wenger routinely made players stretch before and after matches.{{sfnp|Cross|2015|p=20}} Until 2004, he encouraged his players to take Creatine for increased stamina, later stopping when he noticed side-effects.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ranting part of Wenger's grand design |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/henrywinter/2374066/Ranting-part-of-Wengers-grand-design.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/henrywinter/2374066/Ranting-part-of-Wengers-grand-design.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |first=Henry |last=Winter |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=2 March 2004 |access-date=16 March 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The innovations had a desirable effect on the team as it prolonged the careers of his defence,<ref name="amy"/> and made Arsenal stronger in the second half of seasons.{{sfnp|Cross|2015|p=23}} Though Wenger's methods were common in Italian football, they had been unsuccessfully trialled in England until his arrival.{{refn|[[Graeme Souness]], for instance in the early 1990s, changed the players' eating habits at Liverpool, introduced new training methods and monitored their lifestyles.{{sfnp|Rush|2011|p=345}} Some of the senior players were unreceptive to his ideas at first; [[Ian Rush]] retorted "But we won the double on egg and chips," when told about the new menu.{{sfnp|Rush|2011|p=345}} Souness' time at Liverpool was brief compared to his predecessors, lasting under three years.|group=nb}}

===Recruitment and spending policy===
Youth development and scouring for talent abroad is central to Wenger's recruitment policy. He relies on a network of scouts and personal contacts to find and attract talented footballers to play under him. Wenger's strategy is aided by data; for instance, the decision to sign Flamini in 2004 came about as he was looking at statistics to find an understudy to Vieira.<ref>{{cite news |title=A football revolution |url=https://www.ft.com/content/9471db52-97bb-11e0-9c37-00144feab49a |first=Simon |last=Kuper |newspaper=Financial Times |location=London |date=17 June 2011 |access-date=1 March 2016}} {{registration required}}</ref> To examine the mental state of a young footballer, he uses psychometric tests conducted by psychologist Jacques Crevoisier once every two years.<ref>John Cross.

That's basically what a manager is about. When I can do that, I am very happy".{{sfnp|Cross|2015|p=167}}

In his early managerial years, Wenger recognised the potential of football in Africa, which influenced his transfer dealings at Monaco.{{sfnp|Lawrence|2014|p=171}} On the recommendation of [[Claude Le Roy]], he signed Liberian George Weah, who later became the first African to be named [[FIFA World Player of the Year]].{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=66}} Weah, while receiving his award from FIFA president [[João Havelange]] and vice-president [[Lennart Johansson]] invited Wenger up to the stage, spontaneously giving his medal to the manager, as a token of his appreciation.<ref>{{cite news |title=George Weah – unassuming even at the pinnacle of success |url=https://www.fifa.com/ballon-dor/news/y=1996/m=2/news=george-weah-unassuming-even-the-pinnacle-success-71402.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322220531/http://www.fifa.com/ballon-dor/news/y=1996/m=2/news=george-weah-unassuming-even-the-pinnacle-success-71402.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 March 2016 |publisher=FIFA |date=12 February 1996 |access-date=21 February 2016}}</ref> During his final years at Monaco, Wenger worked with [[Roger Mendy]], a Senegalese defender regarded in 1991 as one of the ten best African footballers by ''France Football'',{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=66}} and Nigerian [[Victor Ikpeba]], a forward who earnt the accolade of [[African Player of the Year]].<ref>{{cite news |title=France 98 Aces and wild cards: Eagles with clipped wings |first1=Toyin omo |last1=Adelakun |first2=Chris |last2=Taylor |page=30 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=4 June 1998}}</ref> Wenger also fast-tracked young players such as Petit and [[Lilian Thuram]], and handed debuts to Henry and [[David Trezeguet]].{{sfnp|Rees|2014|p=67}}

In England, Wenger has used his extensive knowledge of the European transfer market and rulings – particularly in his native France – to recruit players. His first purchase as Arsenal manager was Anelka from Paris Saint-Germain for £500,000, a deal which upset the French club as they received little remuneration.{{sfnp|Hare|2003|p=184}} The player's subsequent sale to Real Madrid just two years later for £23.5&nbsp;million highlighted Wenger's shrewdness in the transfer market.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jan/16/chelsea |title=Club-class Anelka has always travelled in style |date=16 January 2008 |first=Simon |last=Hattenstone |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=5 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=This naughty Nic has found a good side |page=66 |first=Ian |last=Chadband |newspaper=London Evening Standard |date=26 January 2007}}</ref> He remained in contact with Guillou's Abidjan-based academy, where he discovered future Arsenal players Touré and [[Emmanuel Eboué]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Meirion |last=Jones |title=Arsenal face Fifa investigation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/5036342.stm |work=BBC News |date=1 June 2006 |access-date=11 March 2016}}</ref> and successfully persuaded Fàbregas and Héctor Bellerín, amongst other [[La Masia]] graduates, to leave Barcelona and join him.<ref>{{cite news |title=Interview: Arsenal loanee Jon Toral on being at Barça and growing up with Bellerin |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/interview-arsenal-loanee-jon-toral-being-barca-and-growing-bellerin#:NhbRJE1wgo9eHA |first=Paul |last=Wilkes |magazine=FourFourTwo |date=3 November 2015 |access-date=11 March 2016}}</ref> Wenger's recruitment of young players came under criticism from Bayern Munich chairman [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]], who protested it was tantamount to [[Trafficking of children|child trafficking]].<ref name="Karl">{{cite news |title=Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger hits back over 'child trafficking' accusation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/5249602/Arsenal-manager-Arsene-Wenger-hits-back-over-child-trafficking-accusation.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/5249602/Arsenal-manager-Arsene-Wenger-hits-back-over-child-trafficking-accusation.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |first=Richard |last=Bright |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=30 April 2009 |access-date=23 May 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Wenger refuted the analogy and said, "Look at [[Roque Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz]] at Blackburn.

===Increase in worldwide players===
Wenger was one of the first managers in English football to scout abroad for talent. His double-winning team of 1998 was described by editor [[Jason Cowley (journalist)|Jason Cowley]] as "a model of racial and multicultural integration. They were the first truly globalised team".<ref>{{cite news |title=The French revolutionary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/may/14/sport.comment |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |first=Jason |last=Cowley |date=14 May 2006 |access-date=15 May 2012}}</ref> Richard Jolly writing for ''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'' added that Wenger aided the Premier League's globalisation and "showed the merit of hiring foreign managers on the basis of their record abroad".<ref>{{cite news |title=Standing at 1000, greatest number is one |url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/standing-at-1-000-greatest-number-is-one |newspaper=The National |location=London |first=Richard |last=Jolly |date=21 March 2014 |access-date=18 May 2014}}</ref> Wenger himself felt he had changed attitudes towards foreign managers in England:

{{blockquote|There was a history and belief in England that the foreign manager could not be successful. Now you have a different feeling, now you think only foreign managers can be successful. That is wrong as well. I believe I contributed to the change in attitude about foreign managers. That can look pretentious but I don't think it is at all. I can show some articles where people tried to prove that the foreign managers can never win an English championship. That has changed and I have certainly contributed to that. But I am also one of the few who also defends English managers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Arsenal were crazy to appoint me, says Arsène Wenger |first=Jamie |last=Jackson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/28/arsene-wenger-arsenal-manager |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=28 September 2009 |access-date=17 July 2013}}</ref>}}

The continued influx of foreign players at Arsenal has, however, attracted criticism. In a league match against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 14 February 2005, Arsenal fielded a 16-man squad that featured no British players for the first time in the club's history. This prompted [[Professional Footballers' Association]] (PFA) chief executive [[Gordon Taylor (footballer)|Gordon Taylor]] to express it would begin "a worrying pattern for English football".<ref>{{cite news |title=Critics fire salvo at all-foreign Arsenal |first=Toby |last=Manhire |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/feb/17/sport.comment |newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 February 2005 |access-date=30 June 2012 |location=London}}</ref> A year later, manager [[Alan Pardew]] commented that Arsenal's Champions League success was "not necessarily a triumph for British football".<ref>{{cite news |title=This was no English victory says Taylor |first=Josie |last=Morris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/mar/10/championsleague2 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=10 March 2006 |access-date=3 July 2006}}</ref> Wenger saw the issue of nationality as irrelevant and said, "When you represent a club, it's about values and qualities, not about passports".<ref>{{cite news |title=Wenger in racism row |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2333481/Wenger-in-racism-row.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2333481/Wenger-in-racism-row.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |first=Henry |last=Winter |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=11 March 2006 |access-date=6 August 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Other pundits including [[Trevor Brooking]], the director of football development at the FA, have defended Wenger.

===Team indiscipline and fair play===
In his early years at Arsenal, Wenger was scrutinised for the club's poor disciplinary record; Winter in 2003 described it as "little short of a crime-wave",<ref>{{cite news |title=Wayward Arsenal are sentenced |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/henrywinter/2424309/Wayward-Arsenal-are-sentenced.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/henrywinter/2424309/Wayward-Arsenal-are-sentenced.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |first=Henry |last=Winter |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=31 October 2003 |access-date=11 September 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref> while chairman [[Peter Hill-Wood]] admitted the players' conduct was unacceptable.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/champions_league/1833381.stm |title=Arsenal admit discipline problem |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 February 2002 |access-date=11 September 2015}}</ref> Between September 1996 and February 2014, the team received 100 [[Misconduct (association football)|red cards]].

==Personal life==
Wenger was married to former basketball player Annie Brosterhous, with whom he has one daughter, Léa (born 1997). In 2010, Wenger appealed for privacy after a British newspaper alleged he had an affair with a French singer.
