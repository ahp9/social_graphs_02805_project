Smith began his playing career as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] with [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] in 1989, where over five years he played 166 league and cup games. After signing for [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] in 1994, three years and 146 appearances later, he moved on to [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]]. In six years with Orient, he made 309 appearances in all competitions before earning a move to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in 2003. After a season with Wednesday, he moved on to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], retiring in January 2005. He scored 54 goals in 566 league games in a 16-year career in the [[English Football League|Football League]].

Returning to Leyton Orient, he worked as assistant manager until January 2009. In July 2009, he was appointed Head of Youth at Walsall before becoming manager in January 2011. He took Walsall from the [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] zone to safety in his first four months in charge. He took Walsall to the [[2015 Football League Trophy final|2015 final]] of the [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophy]] before leaving the club to manage [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in November 2015. Smith was appointed as Aston Villa manager in October 2018 and took the club from 15th in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] to the [[Premier League]] via the [[2019 EFL Championship play-off final|play-offs]] in the 2018–19 season, and then to the [[2020 EFL Cup final]]. Aston Villa dismissed him in November 2021 and soon joined [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] for 13 months in charge. He was appointed as [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] manager on a short-term basis in April 2023. He was appointed head coach of American club Charlotte FC in December 2023.

==Playing career==
Smith was offered schoolboy terms at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] at the age of 15 but was released when the club decided to focus on local players.<ref name="poty"/> He went on to work at a powder paint company.<ref name="poty"/>

===Walsall===
Smith started his professional career at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]], as the club suffered [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] from the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in [[1989–90 Walsall F.C. season|1989–90]] under [[John Barnwell]]'s stewardship. They then struggled to adapt to life in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] under new [[Manager (association football)|manager]]  [[Kenny Hibbitt]], finishing 16th in [[1990–91 Walsall F.C. season|1990–91]] and 15th in [[1991–92 Walsall F.C. season|1991–92]]. The Saddlers qualified for the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] with a fifth-place finish in [[1992–93 Walsall F.C. season|1992–93]], but were badly beaten by [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] at the semi-final stage.<ref name="poty"/> Walsall finished tenth in [[1993–94 Walsall F.C. season|1993–94]], and Smith left the club, having played a total of 166 games for the Saddlers, scoring two goals.

===Hereford United===
In summer 1994, Smith was sold to [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] for [[Pound sterling|£]]80,000, a [[List of Hereford United F.C. records and statistics|club record]] fee for the "Bulls".<ref name="poty"/> They finished 16th in the Third Division in [[1994–95 Hereford United F.C. season|1994–95]] under [[John Layton]].

Hereford were relegated from the [[English Football League]] after finishing in last place in [[1996–97 Hereford United F.C. season|1996–97]]; they had been level on points with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove]] and with a superior [[goal difference]], however, goals scored was the decider.

However, his team were beaten 1–0 by [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] in the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] [[1999 Football League Third Division play-off final|final]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Sport: Football Garcia strike takes Iron up |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/355955.stm |access-date=19 February 2012 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 May 1999}}</ref> Throughout the campaign he scored ten goals in 49 appearances.

He scored four goals in 51 games in [[2001–02 Leyton Orient F.C. season|2001–02]], but [[Paul Brush]]'s team struggled and finished in mid-table, closer to the relegation zone than the play-offs, though they were 16 points above the drop.

==Personal life==
Dean Smith's father, Ron, was an Aston Villa supporter and a steward at [[Villa Park]].

When Villa won the [[1982 European Cup final]], eleven-year-old Dean was a neighbour to Villa player [[Pat Heard]]. Smith was not allowed to go to the final, but Heard ensured the young boy was on the team bus as it paraded the trophy through Birmingham. When appointed manager, Smith picked out Heard as an inspiration.<ref>''I get stopped for photos now when I walk the dog at 6.30 am!'', Ian Ladyman, Daily Mail, 8 September 2019</ref><ref>[http://www.astonvillafpa.org/fixtures/report_2008-03-09-1.php Aston Villa Old Stars vs. Mickey Buttress X1]</ref>
