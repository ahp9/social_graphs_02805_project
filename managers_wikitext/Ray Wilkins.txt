'''Raymond Colin Wilkins''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MBE}} (14 September 1956 – 4 April 2018) was an English [[association football|football]] player and coach.

Born into a footballing family with his father and three brothers involved in the game,<ref name=guardianobit>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/04/ray-wilkins-obituary |title=Ray Wilkins obituary |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=4 April 2018 |date=4 April 2018 |first=Peter |last=Mason }}</ref> Wilkins played as a [[midfielder]]. He began his career at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], where he was appointed [[Captain (association football)|captain]] at the age of 18, and later played for clubs including [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[AC Milan]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. He won 84 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for the [[England national football team]] from 1976 to 1986, playing at [[UEFA Euro 1980]] and the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup]]s.

After his playing career ended, he worked as a television [[pundit]], and as a coach and manager with Queens Park Rangers, [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and Chelsea. He managed [[Jordan national football team|Jordan]] at the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]] and his last coaching job was as the assistant manager of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] later that year.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Hillingdon]], [[Middlesex]], Wilkins started his career with the Sunday League team [[Senrab F.C.|Senrab]] that play in [[Wanstead Flats]], East London.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3580385.stm|title=Lessons from Senrab's soccer school|date=30 March 2004|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref>

===Chelsea===
Wilkins made his name in the 1970s with boyhood club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], which he joined as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]], progressing to his first team debut against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] at the age of 17 on 26 October 1973 as a substitute in a 3–0 home league win.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ray WILKINS - Chelsea FC - League Appearances |url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/chelsea-fc/ray-wilkins-9880/league-appearances_a19029/ |website=Sporting Heroes |access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>

In 1975, following the club's relegation and the departure of many established players, an 18-year-old Wilkins was handed the [[Captain (association football)|captaincy]] of Chelsea by new manager [[Eddie McCreadie]], taking it from long-time Blues captain [[John Hollins]]. He took to the role well, keeping it for four years. He emerged as Chelsea's key player of that period, leading a team of mainly young players to promotion again in [[1976–77 in English football|1976–1977]] and, in the next season, consolidation of their place in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].

His elder brother, [[Graham Wilkins]] also played for Chelsea.

===Manchester United===
In 1979, after Chelsea were relegated,<ref name=bbcdeath/> Wilkins signed for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for a fee of £825,000,<ref name=bt>{{cite news|title=Ray Wilkins' career in numbers|url=http://sport.bt.com/football/ray-wilkins-career-in-numbers-S11364262449449|access-date=4 April 2018|agency=Press Association|publisher=BT Sport|date=4 April 2018|archive-date=5 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405024728/http://sport.bt.com/football/ray-wilkins-career-in-numbers-S11364262449449|url-status=dead}}</ref> the highest fee received for a Chelsea player at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news/latest-news/2018/04/ray-wilkins-1956-2018.html|title=Ray Wilkins 1956–2018|publisher=Chelsea FC|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> He scored ten goals in his five years with the Red Devils, including a long-range strike in the 2–2 draw with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] in the [[1983 FA Cup Final]] (United won the replay).<ref name=bt/>

He was voted player of the year by the team's supporters at the end of the 1983–1984 season. His midfield performances drew the attention of [[AC Milan|Milan]], who made United a £1.5&nbsp;million offer for the player.<ref>Williams, Richard (2 June 2009).

===Milan, Paris and Rangers===
Wilkins signed with [[AC Milan|Milan]] in summer 1984. He later remarked that the most difficult part of adapting to the Italian game was the focus on fitness&nbsp;– the coaching staff made him work to reduce his body fat levels and Wilkins described the result as being in the best shape of his career.<ref name=Int>[http://www.chelseadaft.org/2017/09/ray-wilkins-talks-diego-costa-nemanja.html Ray Wilkins talks Diego Costa, Nemanja Matic and David Luiz.]. Chelsea Daft (August 2017). Retrieved 4 April 2018.</ref> The Italian team was struggling during this period, having suffered relegation in the [[1981–82 Serie A]] season, and Wilkins was joined by fellow Englishman [[Mark Hateley]] (himself replacing another compatriot&nbsp;— [[Luther Blissett]]). The only foreign players in the squad, the pair helped the team to victory over rivals [[Inter Milan]] in the [[Derby della Madonnina|Milan Derby]] that October, winning plaudits from Italian press and the club's fans.<ref>Hodges-Ramon, Luca (20 November 2016).

''The Guardian''. Retrieved on 4 April 2018.</ref> In his first year there, Wilkins played 28 [[Serie A]] games to bring the team to fifth in the league and also won a runner-up medal in the [[Coppa Italia]] (having eliminated Inter in the semis).

The following season he remained a key player in Milan's midfield, appearing in 29 league games and scoring two goals&nbsp;– one late goal to salvage a draw at [[U.S. Avellino 1912|Avellino]] and another goal the following game against [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]]. These were the only Serie A goals of his career.<ref>[https://www.rsssf.org/tablesi/ital86.html Italy Championship 1985/86]. RSSSF.

In Wilkins' final season there ([[1986–87 AC Milan season|1986–1987]]), he fell out of the first team structure, following the signing of [[Roberto Donadoni]] and the continued presence of both [[Agostino Di Bartolomei]] and [[Alberigo Evani]]. The team finished fifth in the league, beating Inter twice, in [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s first year as owner. Wilkins played 105 games (74 in Serie A) for Milan between 1984 and 1987. ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' eulogised him as a "serious and meticulous professional who was immediately appreciated for his long and precise passes".<ref>{{cite news|title=Ray Wilkins, ex stella del Milan, del Chelsea e dell'Inghilterra, è morto|trans-title=Ray Wilkins, ex star for Milan, Chelsea and England, has died|url=http://www.corriere.it/sport/18_aprile_04/morto-ray-wilkins-ex-stella-milan-chelsea-dell-inghilterra-fa3bebe4-3809-11e8-8e5f-085098492e12.shtml?refresh_ce-cp|access-date=4 April 2018|work=Corriere della Sera|date=4 April 2018|language=it}}</ref>

Wilkins signed for [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] in the middle of 1987, but this proved to be short-lived: he failed to break into the team ahead of [[Gabriel Calderón]] and [[Safet Sušić]] so he eagerly took the option to move to Scotland to sign for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] for £250,000 that November.<ref name=Int/>

Reigning Scottish champions, and [[Old Firm]] rivals, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] played Rangers on 27 August 1988.

Following his last appearance for Rangers, Wilkins received a standing ovation from the 40,000 crowd. Despite only playing two seasons for the Glasgow club, he was later inducted into their Hall of Fame.<ref name="gershof" />

===Later career===
The longest stint of his late career was at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], for whom he was a regular first team player from November 1989 to 1994, including the team's first two Premier League seasons. He made his debut in the 3–0 away win versus Crystal Palace.<ref>[https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/english-footballer-ray-wilkins-completes-his-debut-for-news-photo/104294807#/english-footballer-ray-wilkins-completes-his-debut-for-queens-park-picture-id104294807 Wilkins Debut For QPR].
