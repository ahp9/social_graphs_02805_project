The team captain is usually identified by the wearing of an [[armband]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tc-united.com/index.php/adult-soccer/captain|title=Captain|access-date=17 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201030403/http://www.tc-united.com/index.php/adult-soccer/captain|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the 2024/25 edition of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]], it was made mandatory for each team to have a captain and for each captain to be identified by the previously traditional but non-mandatory captain's armband.

== Responsibilities ==
The only official responsibility of a captain specified by the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] is to participate in the [[Coin flipping|coin toss]] prior to [[Kick-off (association football)|kick-off]]<ref>[http://football.about.com/cs/football101/g/gl_cointoss.htm "About Football Glossary"] ''about.com'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031204230551/http://football.about.com/cs/football101/g/gl_cointoss.htm |date=4 December 2003 }}</ref> (for choice of ends or to have kick-off) and prior to a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]]. Captains have no special authority under the Laws to challenge a decision by the [[Referee (association football)|referee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/Leagues/Respect/Captains|title=The website for the English football association, the Emirates FA Cup and the England football team|first=The Football|last=Association|access-date=17 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324192112/http://www.thefa.com/Leagues/Respect/Captains|archive-date=24 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, referees may talk to the captain of a side about the side's general behaviour when necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/Leagues/Respect/Captains/WorkingWithTheRef|title=The website for the English football association, the Emirates FA Cup and the England football team|first=The Football|last=Association|access-date=17 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413015820/http://www.thefa.com/Leagues/Respect/Captains/WorkingWithTheRef|archive-date=13 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

At an award-giving ceremony after a fixture like a cup competition final, the captain usually leads the team up to collect their medals. Any trophy won by a team will be received by the captain, who will also be the first one to hoist it. The captain also generally leads the teams out of the dressing room at the start of the match. A captain is also tasked with running the dressing room.

The captain generally provides a rallying point for the team: if morale is low, it is the captain who will be looked upon to boost their team's spirits.<ref>[http://www.keelbyunited.co.uk/blog/management/TeamCaptain.htm Keelby United – The Role of the Captain in Football Youth Soccer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509033119/http://www.keelbyunited.co.uk/blog/management/TeamCaptain.htm |date=9 May 2013 }}</ref>

Captains may join the manager in deciding the starting eleven for a certain game. In youth or recreational football, the captain often takes on duties that would, at a higher level, be delegated to the [[manager (association football)|manager]].

A ''club captain'' is usually appointed for a [[Season (sports)|season]]. If they are unavailable or not selected for a particular game, or must leave the pitch, then the club vice-captain will assume similar duties.

The match captain is the first player to lift a [[trophy]] should the team win one, even if they are not the club captain. A good example of this was in the [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final]] when match captain [[Peter Schmeichel]] lifted the trophy for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as club captain [[Roy Keane]] was suspended.<ref name="terry">{{cite news |title=John Terry can lift Champions League trophy if Chelsea win final |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/17860112 |access-date=8 January 2021 |work=BBC Sport |date=26 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Schmeichel recalls 1999 marvel |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0254-0d7cb81ae21c-6c4148f30ee6-1000--schmeichel-recalls-1999-marvel/ |website=UEFA |access-date=8 January 2021 |date=29 March 2010}}</ref> In the [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final]], match captain [[Frank Lampard]] (who was the vice-captain) jointly lifted the trophy for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] with club captain [[John Terry]],<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Debono |first1=Matt |title=Frank Lampard defends John Terry wearing full kit after Champions League triumph |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/chelsea/news/frank-lampard-defends-john-terry-champions-league-final-kit |access-date=8 January 2021 |magazine=Sports Illustrated |date=19 May 2020}}</ref> who was suspended, but given permission by UEFA.<ref name="terry" />

A club may appoint two distinct roles: a club captain to represent the players in a public relations role, and correspondent on the pitch. [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] has had both of these types of captains: [[Roy Keane]] was the club captain on ''and'' off the pitch from 1997 to 2005 as he was a regular in the starting eleven, but his successor [[Gary Neville]] while nominally club captain from 2005 to 2010 had made few first team appearances due to injuries. In his absence other players ([[Rio Ferdinand]] or vice-captain [[Ryan Giggs]]) were chosen to captain the team on the field, such as in the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|2008]] (Ferdinand was captain as he was in the starting eleven, while Giggs was a substitute) and [[2009 UEFA Champions League Final]]s, respectively. After Neville retired in 2011, regular starter [[Nemanja Vidić]] was named as club captain.

=== Vice-captain ===

As depicted in the image, vice-captains serve as their team's captain when the regular captain is not included in the starting eleven, or if, during a game, the captain is substituted or sent off.]]
A ''vice-captain'' (or ''assistant captain'') is a player that is expected to captain the side when the club's captain is not included in the starting eleven, or if, during a game, the captain is substituted or sent off. Examples include [[Ronald Araújo]] at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Joshua Kimmich]] at [[Bayern Munich]], and [[Federico Valverde]] at [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]].

In the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], when [[Bryan Robson]] was injured and vice-captain [[Ray Wilkins]] received a two-game suspension for a red card, [[Peter Shilton]] became England's captain for the rest of the tournament.

During the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa, Germany had three captains. [[Michael Ballack]] had captained the national team since 2004, including the successful qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup, but he did not play in the latter tournament due to a last minute injury. [[Philipp Lahm]] was appointed captain in South Africa, but due to an illness that ruled him out of Germany's final fixture, [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] captained the team for that game which was the third-place match. Lahm stated in an interview that he would not relinquish the captaincy when Ballack returned, causing some controversy, so team manager [[Oliver Bierhoff]] clarified the situation, saying: "Philipp Lahm is the World Cup captain and Michael Ballack is still the captain".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,704913,00.html | title = A Power Struggle on the German National Team? | publisher = Spiegel Online | date = 6 July 2010 | access-date = 17 February 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100708234223/http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,704913,00.html | archive-date = 8 July 2010 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,704743,00.html | title = The Team Is 'Winning Hearts Beyond Germany's Borders' | publisher = Spiegel Online | date = 5 July 2010 | access-date = 17 February 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100707100709/http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,704743,00.html | archive-date = 7 July 2010 | url-status = live }}</ref> Lahm ended up becoming the permanent captain of Germany until his retirement, as Ballack was never called up in the national team again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/ben_lyttleton/06/22/euro-2102-lahm-germany/index.html|title=Lahm filling captain's role for Germany in word and deed|access-date=17 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627101719/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/ben_lyttleton/06/22/euro-2102-lahm-germany/index.html|archive-date=27 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/477/euro-2012/2012/06/27/3204679/when-the-going-gets-tough-germany-gets-going-perennial?source=breakingnews|title=Perennial chokers Germany must beat themselves before Italy – Goal.com|date=27 June 2012|access-date=17 December 2016|archive-date=5 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105025026/http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/477/euro-2012/2012/06/27/3204679/when-the-going-gets-tough-germany-gets-going-perennial?source=breakingnews|url-status=dead}}</ref>
