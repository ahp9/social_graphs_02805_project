===American football===
Works teams were common in the early days of [[professional football (gridiron)|professional football]]. The [[Columbus Panhandles]] were a famous works team; it consisted of [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] employees, including the famed [[Nesser Brothers]], and eventually became a charter member of the [[National Football League]].

The [[Chicago Bears]] was established by the [[A. E. Staley]] food starch company of Decatur, Illinois, as a company team under the name 'Decatur Staleys'.

The National Public Safety Football League is a modern-day example of a league of works teams, with each team in the league consisting of employees of a public department (usually police or fire) in a given city.

This tradition is continued by some teams in the [[X-League (Japan)|X-League]], the highest level of American football in Japan; examples include the [[IBM Big Blue (X-League)|IBM Big Blue]] and [[Fujitsu Frontiers]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/2020/04/08/state-football-players-find-opportunities-new-frontier-japan/2969007001/|newspaper=The Detroit News|date=April 8, 2020|title=State players find pro football opportunities in a new frontier: Japan|first=Rod|last=Beard}}</ref>

A number of works teams were founded in the former [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Portuguese territory of Mozambique]] that still are currently major teams in [[Mozambique|that Portuguese-speaking African country]] (independent since 1975). [[Grupo Desportivo da Companhia Têxtil do Punguè]] and [[Textáfrica do Chimoio]] are examples of two works teams which were the teams of two textile companies.

[[FC Motor Zaporizhzhia]] is another football team from [[Zaporizhzhia]] which is owned by the Ukrainian aircraft engine manufacturer [[Motor Sich]]. [[FC Torpedo Zaporizhia]] traces its roots to the team of [[ZAZ]] car factory.

===== United Kingdom =====
Several professional [[association football|football]] clubs in the United Kingdom were also formed as works teams, including [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] (the team of the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] depot at [[Newton Heath]]), [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] (formed as Dial Square in 1886 by workers at the [[Royal Arsenal]] in [[Woolwich]]), [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] (formerly [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames Ironworks]]), [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], founded by workers of the [[Singer Motors|Singer bicycle company]], and the Scottish team [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]] (formerly Ferranti Thistle).

A few amateur and semi-professional United Kingdom association football (soccer) works teams retain their companies' names, including [[Airbus UK Broughton F.C.|Airbus UK]], [[Cammell Laird F.C.|Cammell Laird]], and [[Vauxhall Motors F.C.|Vauxhall Motors]]. Other former and current amateur and semi-professional UK works teams include [[Crawley Down Gatwick F.C.]], [[Civil Service F.C.]], [[Harrogate Railway Athletic F.C.]], [[United Services Portsmouth F.C.]], [[Metropolitan Police F.C.]], [[Stewarts & Lloyds Corby A.F.C.]], [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.]], [[Atherton Collieries A.F.C.]], [[Prescot Cables F.C.]], [[Stocksbridge Park Steels F.C.]] and [[Cardiff Civil Service]]. [[Bath City F.C.|Bath City Football Club]] from Somerset, England, was formed in 1889 as Bath A.F.C. The team changed its name to Bath Railway in 1902, before settling on the name Bath City F.C. Included among Scottish non-league and amateur works teams are [[Inverurie Loco Works F.C.]], [[Colville Park A.F.C.]] ([[Ravenscraig steelworks]]), [[Shawfield Amateurs F.C.|Shawfield Amateurs]] ([[Shawfield|White's Chemical Works]]) and [[Burntisland Shipyard A.F.C.]], while Glynhill Moorcroft A.F.C. began as Babcock & Wilcox F.C., the works team of the Renfrew engineering company.

In [[Northern Ireland]], several companies whose names are retained by local football teams, such as [[Sirocco Works F.C.]], [[Goodyear F.C.]], and [[Ford F.C.]], have closed down, yet the football clubs themselves remain active.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-11-20 |title=STEPPING BACK IN TIME: Sir Samuel Davidson and the Belfast Sirocco Works |url=https://www.newsletter.co.uk/heritage-and-retro/retro/stepping-back-in-time-sir-samuel-davidson-and-the-belfast-sirocco-works-3041985 |access-date=2025-11-12 |website=Belfast News Letter |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-06-18 |title=After more than 40 years, the Goodyear Sports and Social Club is set to close its doors |url=https://www.northernirelandworld.com/news/people/end-of-an-era-as-goodyear-sports-and-social-club-in-lurgan-is-set-to-close-4670767 |access-date=2025-11-12 |website=NorthernIrelandWorld |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Reporter |first=Staff |title=Soccer: Ford FC celebrate Power NI donation |url=https://belfastmedia.com/soccer-ford-fc-celebrate-power-ni-donation |access-date=2025-11-12 |website=Belfast Media Group |language=en}}</ref>

===== Former European countries =====
====== Former SFR Yugoslavia ======
[[File:Dolina_cupova_-_Grbavica_Stadium_2015.jpg|thumbnail|The locomotive at the stadium of [[FK Željezničar Sarajevo|FK Željezničar]], formed by railway employees.<ref>{{cite news |title=Osnivanje kluba&nbsp;– FKZ |url=http://fkzeljeznicar.ba/klub/historija/osnivanje-kluba/ |access-date=14 August 2015 |publisher=fkzeljeznicar.ba}}</ref>]]

[[FK Željezničar Sarajevo|Fudbalski klub Željezničar]] (English: Football Club Željezničar) is a Bosnian professional football club based in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The name Željezničar means "railway worker", because it was established by a group of railway workers. Another working-class football club from Bosnia is [[NK Čelik Zenica|NK Čelik]] (lit. {{Translation|FC Steel|literal=FC Steel|i=y}}) from [[Zenica]], which was founded by the workers of the iron and [[steel mill]] in Zenica. Being a mineral-rich country, with many mines all over Bosnia, led to establishment of several clubs named FK Rudar ({{Translation|FC Miner|i=y|literal=Miner}}), such as [[FK Rudar Prijedor]], [[FK Rudar Ugljevik]], [[FK Rudar Kakanj]], and [[FK Rudar Breza]], while other clubs are simply called FK Radnik or FK Radnički ({{Translation|Laborer|Worker's|i=y}}), such as [[FK Radnik Bijeljina]], [[FK Radnik Hadžići]], and [[FK Radnički Lukavac]].

More clubs in former Yugoslavia were formed by [[Yugoslav Railways]] employees, for instance, Serbian club [[ŽAK Subotica]] (Železničarski atletski klub Subotica, translation ''Railways athletic club Subotica'') was a club formed and backed throughout its existence by the railways company. It was dissolved in 1945.  In its place the new socialist authorities which replaced the monarchy in Yugoslavia formed [[FK Spartak Subotica]] which kept tight links with the railways company.<ref>[http://www.gradsubotica.co.rs/otkud-ime-plavi-golubovi-i-blue-marines/#comment-20844 Otkud ime "Plavi golubovi" i BLUE MARINES] at gradsubotica.co.rs, 9 January 2011, retirved 4 March 2016 {{in lang|sr}}</ref> Željezničar Sarajevo, ŽAK Subotica and Spartak Subotica are the railways-backed clubs with best performances in the league, but besides these there were many others such as [[FK ŽAK Kikinda|ŽAK Kikinda]], [[FK Železničar Beograd|Železničar Belgrade]], [[FK Železničar Smederevo|Železničar Smederevo]], [[FK Železničar Lajkovac|Železničar Lajkovac]], [[FK Železničar Niš|Železničar Niš]], in Serbia, and [[FK Željezničar Doboj|Željezničar Doboj]] in Bosnia.  In other parts of Yugoslavia there are other cases, in North Macedonia, [[FK Rabotnički]] became owned in 1949 by the labour union of the railways company.<ref>[http://www.fkrabotnicki.com/?page_id=3499 ИСТОРИЈА] section: Возобновување (1945–1949), at FK Rabotnički official website, Retrieved 4 March 2016 {{in lang|mk}}</ref> The link between the club and the railways was kept ever since with their followers even nowadays are known as ''Železničari'' and the railways simbol is part of club's logo. In Slovenia the railways had one club in each one of the two main Slovenian cites, [[NK Železničar Maribor]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.navdih.net/datoteke/reference/ZSD_Maribor/ZSD_Maribor_knjiga_80-let.pdf | title = 80 letnica društva | publisher = Železničarsko Športno Društvo | access-date = 27 December 2012 | language = sl | archive-date = 4 March 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025426/http://www.navdih.net/datoteke/reference/ZSD_Maribor/ZSD_Maribor_knjiga_80-let.pdf | url-status = dead }}</ref> and [[NK Železničar Ljubljana]].  In relation with railways, Serbian club [[GFK Jasenica 1911]] became known during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s as FK Mladost GOŠA because at that period the club was backed by the GOŠA, a former train wagons factory from [[Smederevska Palanka]].

Other cases in Yugoslavia include [[HNK Borovo]], which was formed in 1933 as SK BATA Borovo.  The club was formed as the promotional team for the [[Bata Shoes]] factory in [[Borovo naselje|Borovo]] and it was founded by the BATA company founder, [[Tomáš Baťa]] himself.<ref>[http://www.ofkbeograd.net/index.php?id=199 Milorad Sijić: "Football in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512115722/http://www.ofkbeograd.net/index.php?id=199 |date=12 May 2012 }}, pag. 172</ref> The company had already earlier in 1922 became owner of the Czech club [[FC Fastav Zlín|FC Zlín]] which was known between 1924 and 1948 as SK Bata Zlin.<ref>[http://www.fcfastavzlin.cz/zobraz.asp?t=historie Historie] at FC Fastav Zlín official website, Retrieved 4 March 2016 {{in lang|cs}}</ref>

The best well known success story of a company and football club connection in Yugoslavia was the one of [[FK Zemun]].  [[Zemun]], a city just in the outskirts of capital [[Belgrade]], was known for many home-born notable players and some more or less successful football clubs ever since first half of the 1920s.  SK Sparta Zemun played in the [[Yugoslav First League]] still in the 1930s.  However, two decades after the end of the Second World War, the city had just a big number of small lower-leagues clubs.  At that time Zemun was also home of [[Galenika a.d.]], a leading [[pharmaceutical company]] in Yugoslavia and one of the major of all South-Eastern Europe. The company owned a small club, FK Galenika, however by the late 1960s they decided to play a bigger role in football.  FK Jedinstvo Zemun was at time the leading club in the city. In 1962 they achieved promotion to the [[Yugoslav Second League]] but they managed to stay at that level just two seasons.  In 1969 they were playing third level, the Serbian Republic League, and were struggling financially.  It was then that Galenika decided to take over the club and by merging it with its own minor club they formed FK Galenika Zemun.  The company injected resources and backed the club financially, and the results immediately stated to show up. Right in the first season the club managed promotion back to the Yugoslav Second League where they will become among the strongest teams in the following decade. After several failed attempts Galenika Zemun achieved promotion to the Yugoslav First League in 1982 and that same year they reached the semi-finals of the [[Yugoslav Cup]].  Playing in the Yugoslav top level, during the 1980s the club played side-by-side with the big ones such as [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]], [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]], [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]] or [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]], and Yugoslav football fans all became well aware of the name FK Galenika Zemun.  Later, by the early 1990s the wars and the break-up of Yugoslavia started, Galenika suffered the financially asphyxiating consequences of the economic sanctions imposed to Serbia. The company had to drop its backing to the club and the club dropped the company name and became known just as FK Zemun.  They managed to survive for some time during the 1990s in the [[First League of FR Yugoslavia]], however the results were being worse each year, and by the turn of the millennium FK Zemun was relegated to the lower-leagues with just few occasional but flashy and inconsistent comebacks. Easy to conclude how the presence of Galenika in the club was fundamental for them to archive results and stability and without them Zemun supporters can only remember nostalgically the period when the club had its golden era thanks to the perfect wedding with a major local pharmaceutical company.

One of those minor clubs that emerged in Zemun was [[SK Naša Krila Zemun]] (''Naša Krila'' means ''Our Wings''), which existed only for three years between 1947 and 1950, and was formed and owned by the [[Yugoslav Air Force]]. The club managed to achieve an impressive record for such a short existence, making its presence in two seasons in the Yugoslav First League and reaching the Yugoslav Cup final in 1947 and 1949.  While the Yugoslav Air Force created its club in Serbia in Zemun, a suburb of the capital Belgrade, the [[Yugoslav Navy]] created their club in Croatia, in the major Yugoslav port, [[Split, Croatia|Split]], and named it NK Mornar Split.  However, just as Naša Krila, the club was short-lived: it was formed in 1946 and disbanded two years later, and by the 1960s a new club, which was formed by a merger of a number of smaller ones, was making its way to the high end of Yugoslav football.

Serbian club [[FK Smederevo 1924]] was founded as a local iron factory SARTID football team. The club will be known by the company name since its foundation, in 1924, until 1944 when it became nationalised.  In 1992, it will restore the name Sartid just as the club ownership returned to the Sartid metallurgical company and this state of affairs will remain till 2004, the year the company, by then now owned by [[U.S. Steel]], left the direction of the club.

There are many other cases in Serbia, specially among medium-size clubs and their main local companies, such as [[FK Čukarički]] (known as Čukarički Stankom between 2001 and 2011 when it was owned by Stankom company), [[FK Hajduk Kula]] (known as FK Hajduk Rodić during the period it was backed by the Rodić company), [[FK Javor Ivanjica]] (known since summer 2014 as FK Javor Matis due to its backing from local Matis company), [[FK Sloboda Užice]] (known as FK Sloboda Point Sevojno after its merger with FK Sevojno in 2010 and backing from Point company), [[FK ČSK Pivara|ČSK Čelarevo]] (also known as ČSK Pivara, owned and closely related throughout its history by beer manufacturer [[Pivara Čelarevo]]), [[FK Mladost Apatin]] (formed by the owner of a local clothing factory Tri Zvezde, it was named since its foundation in 1924 till 1950 as SK Tri Zvezde and during that time most of the players of the squad were also employees at the factory<ref>Fudbal u Kraljevini Jugoslaviji, Sijić, p. 173</ref>).

====== Former Soviet Union ======
{{further|Voluntary Sports Societies of the Soviet Union}}
A widespread works team system formed the basis of amateur sport in the Soviet Union, with virtually all workplaces and industries having sport teams. The system also provided the support for ''de facto'' professional athletes, who were employees of various non-sport agencies and enterprises and officially designated as amateurs.

==== North America ====
[[Bethlehem Steel F.C. (1907–30)|Bethlehem Steel F.C.]], which holds a record number of [[U.S. Open Cup]] wins, was the factory team of the [[Bethlehem Steel]] Corporation in Pennsylvania. The [[New York Red Bulls]] is a well-known company team in the US.

===== Mexico =====
One of the most popular teams in Mexico, [[Cruz Azul]], is a works team owned by [[Cooperativa La Cruz Azul, S.C.L.]], an industrial cement company. The team was formed on 22 May 1927 by some of the company's workers.

==== South America ====
===== Argentina =====
Several Argentinian clubs began life as the works teams of British-owned railway companies, including [[Rosario Central]], [[Talleres de Córdoba]], [[Ferro Carril Oeste]], [[Club Ferrocarril Midland]] and [[Club Atlético Central Córdoba]]. Club [[Deportivo Mandiyú]], also referred to as Mandiyú, is an [[Argentine football]] club, based in [[Corrientes]], in the Province of the same name. The club was founded under the name "Club Deportivo Tipoiti" on 14 December 1952, by a group of textile workers from the Tipoiti textile factory in Corrientes, Argentina. Because the [[Argentine Football Association]] did not accept commercial company names, the club had to change its name to "Club Deportivo Mandiyú", which means cotton in the indigenous language of [[Guarani dialects|Guaraní]].

===== Brazil =====
In Brazil, clubs that were born as works teams include São Paulo Railway (now [[Nacional Atlético Clube (SP)|Nacional]]), Cotonifício Rodolfo Crespi (now [[Clube Atlético Juventus|Juventus]]), [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista]] (also a [[sporting club]], formed by railway workers), and [[Bangu Atlético Clube|Bangu]]. [[Artsul Futebol Clube|Artsul]] (concrete industry), [[Associação Desportiva Recreativa e Cultural Icasa|Icasa]] (cotton industry) and [[Red Bull Bragantino]] (energy drink industry) are examples of football teams established and backed by companies, also known as company teams.

===== Ecuador =====
In Ecuador, a perfect example of a works team is [[CS Emelec]], which was founded by the [[Empresa Eléctrica del Ecuador]], [[Guayaquil]]'s first electric company. For several decades, Emelec's players and directors were employees in the company, though such involvement decreased gradually until the company eventually folded in the 2000s (decade), the club being de facto autonomous for decades before. [[Sociedad Deportiva Aucas]] is another important works team in Ecuador. Historically the most popular team in [[Quito]], Aucas was founded and initially integrated and financed by employees of [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. They named the club after the [[Huaorani]] tribes that they encountered while prospecting for oil in the Ecuadorian Amazonian jungles.

===== Peru =====
In Peru, [[Club Alianza Lima]] was founded as Sport Alianza in 1901 by workers in the Alianza Racing Horse Stud, then property of two-time President of Peru [[Augusto B. Leguía]].

===== Uruguay =====
Uruguay has one of the best known clubs that began as a works team: [[Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club]], or just CURCC, which was the basis for the later foundation of [[Club Atlético Peñarol|Peñarol]], one of the top two clubs in that country.

===Baseball===
In the early days of baseball, most teams were composed of amateurs, and many of these teams were composed of players who worked for a business, such as a factory or railroad yard.  As the profile of the sport rose, professional teams began to dominate and the factory teams faded away.<ref>"[https://historicbaseball.com/1860s-dawn-of-professional-baseball-teams-era/ 1860s: Dawn of Professional Baseball Teams Era]", Historic Baseball; accesses 2024.11.13.</ref>

In Japan, teams playing in the [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] leagues, like the [[Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks]], a prominent professional baseball team owned by the [[SoftBank Group]], are company teams which employ the name of their owners in their official team names and logos.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Meisenzahl |first=Mary |title=Softbank's baseball team in Japan replaced fans with robots in the stands as the season starts without crowds |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/softbank-hawks-japanese-baseball-pepper-robots-2020-7 |access-date=2023-08-29 |website=Business Insider |language=en-US}}</ref> Other company teams belonging to major corporations competing in the main Japanese professional baseball leagues include [[Chiba Lotte Marines]] ([[Lotte Holdings]]), [[Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters]] ([[Nippon Ham|Nippon Ham Co., Ltd]]), [[Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles]] ([[Rakuten]]) and [[Tokyo Yakult Swallows]] ([[Yakult Honsha]]), among others.

=== Basketball ===

==== Philippines ====
Most professional sports teams in the Philippines until recently, have been owned by companies, and leagues are exclusively participated at by these teams. Examples of such leagues include the [[Philippine Basketball Association]], and formerly the [[Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association]] and the [[Philippine Basketball League]].

Recent developments saw the emergence of leagues with teams based on localities, such as the [[Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League]] and the [[National Basketball League (Philippines)|National Basketball League]].

==== Portugal ====
The [[Clube Portugal Telecom]], commonly known as Portugal Telecom, was a [[basketball]] team based in [[Lisbon]], Portugal. The club, a company team, was founded in 1996 and was owned by [[Portugal Telecom]], the largest telecommunications service provider in the country. It was dissolved in 2003.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Primeiro título da Portugal Telecom |url=https://www.record.pt/modalidades/basquetebol/detalhe/primeiro-titulo-da-portugal-telecom |access-date=2024-04-06 |website=www.record.pt |language=pt-PT}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=O "adeus" da Portugal Telecom numa final com história garantida |url=https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/modalidades/17-06-2003/o-adeus-da-portugal-telecom-numa-final-com-historia-garantida |access-date=2024-04-06 |website=Maisfutebol |language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last= |date=2003-05-28 |title=PT acaba com equipas profissionais de basquetebol |url=https://www.publico.pt/2003/05/28/desporto/noticia/pt-acaba-com-equipas-profissionais-de-basquetebol-1149981 |access-date=2024-04-06 |website=PÚBLICO |language=pt}}</ref>

=== Cycling ===
Many [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI) professional cycling teams are owned, sponsored and managed by companies in order to raise [[Brand awareness|awareness]] of those companies' [[brand]]s. These cycling teams are usually named after those companies and brands in a premeditated attempt to boost those companies' [[marketing strategy]]. Examples of this have been found in many different geographical locations and markets around the world and throughout the history of the sport. [[UCI WorldTeam]] is the term used by the UCI to name a cycling team of the highest category in professional road cycling and many have been backed by commercial brands to such an extent that the team name became interchangeable with the commercial brand behind it. Until the mid-1950s professional cycling sponsorship was limited to manufacturing companies in the bicycle business. In 1954, when the European post-war bike boom ended, European bike companies became financially stressed. In 1953, the [[Ganna (cycling team)|Ganna bike company's racing team]] told its top rider [[Fiorenzo Magni]] that it would be unable to maintain the team in the following season. Magni was well-connected with the German [[Nivea]] brand because the riders used Nivea products to soften the chamois in their shorts. When Magni signed the cosmetic company as his team's title sponsor, he spearheaded a new trend in cycling where teams became part and parcel of many companies' marketing strategy.<ref>{{Cite web |title=list of cycling team sponsors, old and new |url=https://bikeraceinfo.com/riderhistories/sponsors-directory.html |access-date=2023-09-20 |website=bikeraceinfo.com}}</ref> [[Peugeot (cycling team)|Peugeot's cycling team]], a fully-fledged factory team or company team in cycling by definition since [[Peugeot]] founded the team and produced its bikes, is listed on [[Cycling Ranking|cyclingranking.com]] as the most successful cycling team of all time, with a large margin on the second placed team, [[Alcyon (cycling team)|Alcyon]] (started by Alcyon, a French bicycle, automobile and motorcycle manufacturer).<ref>{{cite web |title=All-time Team Ranking |url=https://www.cyclingranking.com/teams/overall |website=cyclingranking.com}}</ref>

=== Rugby union ===
Currently the strongest works teams are in Asia. The [[Top League]] in Japan features teams such as [[Suntory Sungoliath]], [[Toyota Verblitz]] and [[IBM Big Blue (rugby union)|IBM Big Blue]]. [[Samsung Group|Samsung]] has a team in the Korean league.

United Kingdom's [[rugby union]] too has a works team tradition going back many decades, and although the clubs have declined post professionalism in heartland countries, it has not been completely extinguished. As late as 1988 the Wales captain played his club rugby for South Wales Police. As of 2017, Tata Steel play in the Second Flight of the WRU Club Pyramid. The British Army still plays occasional matches against clubs, and has won the Middlesex Sevens in the 2000s.

== Works or factory teams in motorsport ==

[[File:KTM MotoGP-Maschinen.jpg|thumb|[[Red Bull KTM Factory Racing]], a joint factory-backed team of [[KTM]] and company team of [[Red Bull]] in [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]].]]
In [[motorsport]], the most well-established or traditional definition of a works team or factory-backed team is a manufacturer that builds its own car or motorbike including the engine.<ref name=":3" /> In a broader sense, it can also be any team that is financed and run by a manufacturer or other business, institution, or organization.
