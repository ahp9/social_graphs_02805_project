In sport a '''semi-closed league''' (also referred to as a '''semi-open league''') is a sports league where a group of teams are guaranteed entry into the league every season, while another group of teams have to qualify or stand at risk of relegation following each season. It is considered a hybrid of [[closed league]]s and leagues with [[promotion and relegation]]. Semi-closed leagues can lead to a league where its permanent members are richer vis-à-vis the remaining teams in these semi-closed leagues or teams in more local competitions in which permanent members compete.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Quillen|first=Ian Nicholas|title=Proposed European Super League Is Not A Closed System Like Major League Soccer.
