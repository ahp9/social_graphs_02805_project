==Origin==
The term first appeared in 1858 in [[cricket]], to describe [[H. H. Stephenson]] taking three [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|wickets]] with three consecutive [[delivery (cricket)|deliveries]]. Fans held a collection for Stephenson, and presented him with a hat bought with the proceeds.<ref>''Extended Oxford English Dictionary'' 1999 Edition : "It came into use after HH Stephenson took three wickets in three balls for the all-England eleven against the twenty-two of Hallam at the Hyde Park ground, Sheffield in 1858. A collection was held for Stephenson (as was customary for outstanding feats by professionals) and he was presented with a cap or hat bought with the proceeds."</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=hat-trick |url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hat-trick |access-date=July 27, 2023 |website=Oxford Learner's Dictionaries}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Hutchinson |first=Sean |date=2014-04-24 |title=Where Does the Phrase 'Hat Trick' Come From? |url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/56326/where-does-phrase-hat-trick-come |access-date=2023-07-28 |website=Mental Floss |language=en-US}}</ref> The term was used in print for the first time in 1865 in the [[Essex Chronicle|''Chelmsford Chronicle'']].<ref>A report of a match between Grays and Romford in {{closed access}} {{cite book |title=The Chelmsford Chronicle |url=http://find.galegroup.com/bncn/infomark.do?serQuery=Locale%28en%2C%2C%29:FQE=%28JX%2CNone%2C22%29%22Chelmsford%20Chronicle%22%24&queryType=PH&type=pubIssues&prodId=BNCN&version=1.0&source=library |date=23 June 1865 |oclc=866859233 |id={{OCLC|17645885|702688846|42349342}} |quote=Mr Biddell...with his second ball bowled the Romford leviathan Mr Beauchamp and afterwards effected the hat-trick by getting three wickets in the over. |url-access=subscription |last1=Messner |first1=Reinhold | publisher=Executive Excellence Pub. |access-date=27 March 2017 |archive-date=28 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328021059/http://find.galegroup.com/bncn/infomark.do?serQuery=Locale%28en%2C%2C%29:FQE=%28JX%2CNone%2C22%29%22Chelmsford%20Chronicle%22%24&queryType=PH&type=pubIssues&prodId=BNCN&version=1.0&source=library |url-status=live }}</ref>{{non primary source needed|date=July 2021}} The term was eventually adopted by many other sports including [[hockey]], [[association football]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Why is it called a hat-trick? - Pelé youngest in World Cup, Pontikas youngest ever|url=https://vimbuzz.com/why-is-it-called-a-hat-trick/|publisher=vimbuzz.com|date=18 December 2022|author=|access-date=1 April 2023|archive-date=1 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230401071429/https://vimbuzz.com/why-is-it-called-a-hat-trick/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Formula 1]] racing, rugby, [[water polo]], and competitive video games such as ''[[Counter-Strike]]''.

==Use==

===Bat and ball games===

==== Baseball ====
In the past, the term was occasionally used to describe when a player [[strikeout|struck out]] three times in a baseball game, and the term ''[[golden sombrero]]'' was more commonly used when a player struck out four times in a game.

In recent years, hat trick has been more often used to describe when a player hits three [[home run]]s in a game.

For example, on 29 August 2015, [[Toronto Blue Jays]] fans celebrated [[Edwin Encarnación]]'s third home run of the game by throwing hats onto the field, similar to the tradition in ice hockey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/hat-trick--edwin-encarnacion-hits-three-homers--drives-in-nine-in-jays-win-202735441.html|title=Hat trick!

==== Gridiron football ====
The term hat-trick is only occasionally used in [[gridiron football]], usually for rhetorical flourish in [[sports journalism|sports writing]]. Usually an offensive player scoring three [[touchdowns]] in a single game is awarded a hat-trick.

Additionally, the term is applied to a defensive player, often an [[edge rusher]], who in a single [[down (gridiron football)|scrimmage play]] performs a [[quarterback sack|sack]] which causes the quarterback to [[fumble]], and then recovers that fumble.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://wildcatbluenation.com/2021/11/10/former-kentucky-football-star-josh-allen/|title=Kentucky Football: Former Wildcat Josh Allen honored for rare NFL hat-trick|publisher=Fansided|date=10 Nov 2021|access-date=10 Nov 2021|archive-date=10 Nov 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211110174628/https://wildcatbluenation.com/2021/11/10/former-kentucky-football-star-josh-allen/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In both codes of [[rugby football]] ([[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]]) a hat-trick is when a player scores three or more [[Try (rugby)|tries]] in a game.  In rugby union, a related concept is that of a "full house" (scoring a try, [[Try (rugby)|conversion]], [[penalty (rugby)|penalty goal]], and [[drop goal]]) in a single game. When a player scores two tries, this is often referred to as a '''brace'''. As with association football, it is common to award the match ball to a player who scores a hat-trick.

[[Ken Irvine]], [[Frank Burge]], and [[Alex Johnston (rugby league)|Alex Johnston]] have scored 16 hat-tricks in Australian first grade rugby league.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rugby League Tables / Scoring Records |url=http://afltables.com/rl/scorers/misc.html#mht |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714020249/http://afltables.com/rl/scorers/misc.html#mht |archive-date=14 July 2015 |access-date=6 July 2015 |work=afltables.com}}</ref>

In  [[field hockey]], [[ice hockey]], and [[bandy]], a hat trick occurs when a player scores three goals in a single game. A hat trick in ice hockey, as it is known in its current form, culminates with fans throwing hats onto the ice from the stands.  The tradition is said to have begun among fans in the [[National Hockey League]] around the 1950s,<ref name="guelph">{{Cite news|title=Guelph's tricky claim|url=http://news.guelphmercury.com/News/article/455592|access-date=6 April 2009|date=21 March 2009|newspaper=[[Guelph Mercury]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325053026/http://news.guelphmercury.com/News/article/455592|archive-date=25 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

A [[Gordie Howe hat trick]] is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] play on the feat. It is achieved by scoring a goal, getting an assist, and getting into a fight, all in the same game. Namesake [[Gordie Howe]] himself only recorded two in his NHL career. [[Rick Tocchet]] accomplished the feat 18 times in his career, the most in NHL history.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=514973 | title=Going inside the 'Gordie Howe Hat Trick' | author=John McGourty | work=Inside NHL | publisher=NHL | date=25 January 2010 | access-date=13 March 2012 | archive-date=17 January 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117150321/http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=514973 | url-status=live }}</ref>

In October 1995, [[Florida Panthers]] captain [[Scott Mellanby]] scored a [[rat trick]], the term coined by teammate [[John Vanbiesbrouck]]. Prior to the game, Mellanby killed a [[rat]] in the Panthers' locker room with his [[hockey stick]], and proceeded to score a pair of goals later that night.<ref name="Rat Pack">{{cite magazine |last=Montville |first=Leigh |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1008229/index.htm |title=Rat Pack |magazine=Sports Illustrated |date=10 June 1996 |access-date=29 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206082730/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1008229/index.htm |archive-date=6 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> When Mellanby scored a hat trick in a later game, some Florida fans threw plastic rats onto the ice, a tradition that continued for all Panthers' goals throughout the [[1996 Stanley Cup playoffs|1996 playoffs]].
