The '''Old Firm''' is a collective term for the Scottish [[association football|football]] clubs [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], which are both based in [[Glasgow]]. The two clubs are the most successful and popular in Scotland, and the rivalry between them has become deeply embedded in Scottish culture. It has reflected and contributed to political, social and religious division and [[sectarianism]] in Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|title=Passion, pride, tradition and nastiness: Why Old Firm match is greatest derby in the world|work=[[Glasgow Times|Evening Times]] |date=11 March 2017|access-date=31 July 2018|archive-date=2 July 2018|url-status=live |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/other_football/15149515.Passion__pride__tradition_and_nastiness__Why_Old_Firm_match_is_greatest_derby_in_the_world/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702204441/http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/other_football/15149515.Passion__pride__tradition_and_nastiness__Why_Old_Firm_match_is_greatest_derby_in_the_world/}}</ref> As a result, matches between them have had an enduring appeal around the world.<ref name="FIFA">{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326141358/https://www.fifa.com/news/y=2009/m=2/news=old-firm-enduring-appeal-1023776.html|archive-date=26 March 2018|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/rivalries/newsid=1023776/index.html |title=Classic Rivalries: Old Firm's enduring appeal |publisher=[[FIFA]] |date=16 April 2016|access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref>

Since the [[1985–86 in Scottish football|1985–86 season]], one half of the Old Firm has won the [[Scottish Premier League|Scottish League]] every season, and in all but [[2005–06 Scottish Premier League|one]] of seventeen seasons between [[1995–96 in Scottish football|1995–96]] and [[2011–12 in Scottish football|2011–12]], both clubs finished in the top two places. 

In the early 2010s, Rangers [[Administration and liquidation of the Rangers Football Club plc|endured financial difficulties, and its holding company was liquidated in 2012]]. Subsequently, the club had to apply for entry to the bottom (fourth) tier of the Scottish league. As a result of the liquidation, many Celtic supporters maintain that the current Rangers is distinct from the pre-2012 club, and the rivalry no longer exists under the Old Firm identity. Instead, they (and often Celtic themselves) use the more generic term '''Glasgow derby''' to refer to the rivalry.<ref name=demise/><ref name=define/><ref name="SMH22"/><ref>[https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/why-is-celtic-vs-rangers-called-the-old-firm-derby/2i9ekbdius7e10xt04lrg85s0 Why is Celtic vs Rangers called the Old Firm derby?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220401140030/https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/why-is-celtic-vs-rangers-called-the-old-firm-derby/2i9ekbdius7e10xt04lrg85s0 |date=1 April 2022 }}, Goal.com, 27 January 2022.

Celtic and Rangers have played each other 448 times in major competitions; both clubs have won 171 matches, with 106 ending in a draw.

The clubs have large fan bases around Glasgow and Scotland and have supporters clubs in many towns throughout Scotland and in cities around the world. In 2005 the presence of Rangers and Celtic was estimated to be worth £120 million to the [[Economy of Scotland|Scottish economy]] each year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Old Firm on the ball for economy|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4635535.stm|work=BBC News|date=29 June 2005|access-date=29 June 2005|archive-date=27 May 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120527001857/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4635535.stm|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Origin of 'Old Firm'==
The origin of the term is unclear but may derive from the two clubs' initial match in which the commentators referred to the teams as "like two old, firm friends",<ref>Murray, William J. (1984) The Old Firm: sectarianism, sport, and society in Scotland; Edinburgh: J. Donald Publishers; Atlantic Highlands, N.J. {{ISBN|0-85976-121-5}}</ref> or alternatively may stem from a [[Satire|satirical]] cartoon published in 'The Scottish Referee' sports newspaper prior to the [[1903–04 Scottish Cup#Final|1904 Scottish Cup final]] between the sides, depicting an elderly man with a [[sandwich board]] reading ''"Patronise The Old Firm: Rangers, Celtic Ltd"'',<ref>[https://www.londonhearts.com/scores/images/1904/1904041502.htm The Scottish Final.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220401140030/https://www.londonhearts.com/scores/images/1904/1904041502.htm |date=1 April 2022 }} The Scottish Referee, 15 April 1904.

At the turn of the 21st century, the two clubs jointly registered the 'Old Firm' term at the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|Intellectual Property Office]]; it was confirmed this was still being renewed as a trademark in 2021.<ref>[https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/19149375.celtic-renewed-old-firm-trademark-rangers-days-were-not-half-anything-tweet/?ref=nuo Celtic renewed 'Old Firm' trademark with Rangers days before 'we're not half of anything' tweet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417213951/https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/19149375.celtic-renewed-old-firm-trademark-rangers-days-were-not-half-anything-tweet/?ref=nuo |date=17 April 2021 }}, Glasgow Times, 10 March 2021</ref>

The competition between the two clubs had roots in more than just a simple sporting rivalry.<ref name="FIFA"/> It has as much to do with Northern Ireland as Scotland and this can be seen in the flags, cultural symbols, and emblems of both clubs.<ref name="Alottodo">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2324152/Old-Firm-rivalry-Its-a-lot-to-do-with-football.html|title=Old Firm rivalry?

Another primary contributor to the intensity of the rivalry in the west of Scotland was that Rangers supporters are historically native Scots and [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]],<ref name=define/> and Celtic supporters are historically [[Irish-Scottish people|Irish-Scots]]. Although the confrontation between the two sets of supporters was often labelled as 'Sectarianism', 'Native-Immigrant tension' was an equally accurate catalyst for hostility between the two teams' supports in Scotland. Rangers' traditional support was largely from the Protestant community, and for decades the club had an [[unwritten rule]] whereby they [[Rangers F.C. signing policy|would not knowingly sign a player of the Catholic faith]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotzine.com/2012/12/fran-sandaza-interview-opens-up-old-wounds-of-sectarianism/ |title=Fran Sandaza interview opens up old wounds of Sectarianism at Rangers |work=Scotzine |date=2012-12-30 |access-date=2017-06-01 |archive-date=6 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606135822/http://www.scotzine.com/2012/12/fran-sandaza-interview-opens-up-old-wounds-of-sectarianism/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The policy was decried by [[Graeme Souness]] when he became manager, and he brought ex-Celtic forward [[Mo Johnston]] to the club in a very public move away from the practice, which no longer continues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rangers.co.uk/club/history/club-history/item/507-the-souness-revolution |title=The Souness Revolution |work=rangers.co.uk |publisher=Rangers FC |access-date=2 December 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005080733/http://www.rangers.co.uk/club/history/club-history/item/507-the-souness-revolution |archive-date=5 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=mojo>{{cite web |author=Ewan Murray |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/jul/10/maurice-mo-johnston-rangers-celtic |title=Why Mo Johnston still stirs emotions across Glasgow |work=The Guardian |date=10 July 2009 |access-date=2017-06-01 |archive-date=29 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829123824/https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/jul/10/maurice-mo-johnston-rangers-celtic |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=mojo2>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jul/11/rangers-sign-catholic |title=10 July 1989: Rangers sign a Catholic |first=Bill |last=McMurdo |work=The Guardian |date=11 July 2009 |access-date=4 October 2015 |archive-date=5 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005023306/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jul/11/rangers-sign-catholic |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=AFPdivide/> Celtic's support was largely from those of [[Irish people|Irish]] Roman Catholic backgrounds and while the club practiced no exclusion of Protestants and signed many of them to play for the team, there was a pro-Catholic mindset among some of the employees.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Andrew|title=Tommy Gemmell: The Celtic full-back who took role to the future|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/tommy-gemmell-the-celtic-full-back-who-took-role-to-the-future-1-4381762|access-date=1 June 2017|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=4 March 2017|archive-date=2 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402230707/http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/tommy-gemmell-the-celtic-full-back-who-took-role-to-the-future-1-4381762|url-status=live}}</ref> One effect is that [[Flag of Scotland|Scottish flag]]s are rarer than might be expected amongst both sets of supporters; Celtic fans are more likely to wave the [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]] while Rangers fans tend to wave the [[Union Jack]].<ref name=disunited/>

Several objects were thrown by Celtic fans, one of which struck referee [[Hugh Dallas]] forcing the game to be stopped while he received medical treatment.<ref name = "dallas"/><ref name=disunited/><ref name=moments/> With many of those in attendance having spent a full weekend drinking alcohol prior to the event, at least four Celtic fans invaded the field of play to confront Dallas during the game,<ref name = "dallas">{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/scottish_premier/334094.stm|title=Rangers make history out of chaos|work=BBC News|date=3 May 1999|access-date=16 August 2010|archive-date=27 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327223319/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/scottish_premier/334094.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> and more missiles were thrown at players on the pitch after the game.<ref name = "dallas"/> Since the events of that day, Old Firm league matches have normally been played in the early afternoon and the possibility of an Old Firm title decider has been deliberately avoided.<ref>{{cite news|last=Drysdale|first=Neil|work=STV Sport|date=14 April 2010|access-date=28 November 2010|title=Old Firm derby reduced to a mere sideshow?

===Incidents involving players===
Over the hundreds of matches played between the rivals, players and staff have been involved in many incidents beyond the usual bad tackles and red cards commonly associated with derby matches around the world; in the modern age of video footage, such incidents are more frequently observed, reviewed and scrutinised. [[Rangers F.C. 2–2 Celtic F.C.

During the 2018 close season, Rangers announced that they would be cutting the ticket allocation for Celtic fans at Ibrox from around 7,000 (the entire Broomloan Stand) to 800, situated in a corner where smaller travelling supports were usually accommodated, following a fan survey backing the proposal as well as an upturn in season ticket sales.

===Legislation===
From 1 March 2012, the police were given more powers to act against Sectarian acts at football matches through the new [[Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012]]. The law was designed specifically to target the Old Firm rivalry by reducing the religious hatred between the two opposing sides.<ref name=eternal/> The Act created two new offences, one covering behaviour in and around football matches and the other related to posts sent by either electronic or postal methods. People convicted under the act could face up to five years imprisonment, a much higher sentence than was previously in place. It was hoped it would make it much easier to prosecute this misbehaviour, which had proved difficult in the past.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20205917 |title=New sectarian law hailed a success by Lord Advocate |work=BBC News |date=5 November 2012 |access-date=21 July 2018 |archive-date=28 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181028092939/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20205917 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In March 2013 a protest by a number of Celtic fans took place to protest against the new laws and the subsequent match bans that a number of fans had received for breaking the Act. The protesters, known as the "[[Green Brigade]]", had marched without police authority and the event was therefore cracked down on by local authorities resulting in thirteen arrests. The protestors claim that the police instigated the trouble that occurred at this march.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-21813699 |title=Arrests made as Green Brigade protest is broken up |work=BBC News |date=16 March 2013 |access-date=21 July 2018 |archive-date=30 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030122502/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-21813699 |url-status=live }}</ref> Following the march, media coverage reported that the fans were growing further apart from the police than ever before. They claimed that the trust the fans hold with the police to work in cooperation with them is falling dramatically. The march that took place resulted in a number of complaints from both Celtic and Rangers fan groups that they were harassed by the police.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-21849341 |title=Old Firm fans in danger of 'losing trust in police', say MSPs |work=[[BBC News]] |date=19 March 2013 |access-date=21 July 2018 |archive-date=28 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181028093037/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-21849341 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Labour MSP [[James Kelly (Scottish politician)|James Kelly]] introduced the ''Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Repeal) (Scotland) Bill'' in June 2017. Kelly had described the 2012 legislation as having "completely failed to tackle sectarianism" and as "illiberal" which "unfairly targets football fans", and was "condemned by legal experts, human rights organisations and equality groups".<ref name=eternal/><ref>{{cite web|title=Official Report – 25 January 2018|url=http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/report.aspx?r=11325&mode=pdf|website=Scottish Parliament|access-date=11 September 2018|archive-date=11 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911044847/http://www.parliament.scot/parliamentarybusiness/report.aspx?r=11325&mode=pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Professor Sir [[Tom Devine]] previously spoke of the Football Act as "''the most illiberal and counterproductive act passed by our young Parliament to date''" and a "''stain on the reputation of the Scottish legal system for fair dealing''".<ref>{{cite web|title=Sheriff who called SNP's anti-bigotry law 'mince' steps down from bench after 27 years|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sheriff-who-called-snps-anti-8222982|work=Daily Record|date=19 June 2016 |access-date=11 September 2018|archive-date=11 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911044850/https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sheriff-who-called-snps-anti-8222982|url-status=live}}</ref> Much was made of when a Sheriff described the law as "mince".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=James|title=Why the SNP must scrap the act|url=https://scraptheact.com/2018/01/23/agenda-column/|website=ScrapTheAct|access-date=11 September 2018|archive-date=18 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218090335/https://scraptheact.com/2018/01/23/agenda-column/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Wartime competitions===
In [[World War I]], the Scottish Cup was suspended. Among the unofficial competitions which were held for fundraising purposes was the [[Navy and Army War Fund Shield]], during which Rangers defeated Celtic in December 1914.<ref name="War Fund Shield">{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-football-historical-archive.co.nf/war-fund-shield.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403231900/http://www.scottish-football-historical-archive.co.nf/war-fund-shield.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 April 2019|title=War Fund Shield|publisher=Scottish Football Historical Archive (archive version)|access-date=13 November 2019}}</ref>

==Comparative league placings==
The dominance of the clubs can be demonstrated by their relative league positions historically. The clubs have finished in the top two positions in the top division of the Scottish league 54 times, including on 22 occasions since 1996. Both sides have finished outside the top two places only five times, three of those before 1914, and both have finished outside the top three places only once, in 1965, when Rangers finished 5th and Celtic 8th. Conversely, between 1947 and 1965, on no occasion were both the top two league positions taken by the two teams, owing mostly to an extended period in the relative doldrums for Celtic, despite a title win in 1954, their only such title in a 28 year period. Celtic, however, ended that period emphatically with a run of nine successive titles, during which Rangers were runners-up on six occasions.

Hampden, [[Scotland national football team|Scotland's national stadium]] and home of [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], is situated roughly an equal distance from Ibrox and Celtic Park in Glasgow.

==Dominance of Scottish football==
The intensity of the rivalry is fuelled by the clubs' historical duopoly in Scottish football, with most meetings between them being pivotal in deciding the destiny of a championship or cup and anything but a title-winning season seen as a major disappointment, particularly as it would usually mean 'the enemy' has won the trophy.

Statistics show that Rangers and Celtic have been by far the most successful clubs involved in the [[Scottish Football League]] since its formation in [[1890–91 in Scottish football|1890]]. The pair were the only participants in every edition of the competition until [[2011–12 in Scottish football|2012]], when Rangers were [[Administration and liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc|removed from the top tier for economic reasons]]; they returned for the [[2016–17 in Scottish football|2016–17]] season.

Of the [[List of Scottish football champions|128 championships played]], 110 (86%) have been won by one of the Old Firm teams, with both Celtic and Rangers winning it 55 times, and 19 between ten other clubs (including a shared title between Rangers and [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]]). Although there have been brief periods when silverware went elsewhere, there have also been long spells of domination by each Old Firm club; the [[nine in a row]] championship record was first set by Celtic between [[1965–66 in Scottish football|1966]] and [[1973–74 in Scottish football|1974]], equalled by Rangers between [[1988–89 in Scottish football|1989]] and [[1996–97 in Scottish football|1997]], and again by Celtic between [[2011–12 in Scottish football|2012]] and [[2019–20 in Scottish football|2020]].<ref name=ends20/>

On just five occasions since 1891 have neither of the Glasgow giants been the league winner nor the runner-up.

Although the initial [[Scottish Cup]] was played in [[1873–74 Scottish Cup|1874]], 15 years before Celtic were formed, they have still won the competition more than any other club – 42 times, plus 19 runners-up – with Rangers on 34 (19 runners-up). Next in the winners list (other than [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] whose wins were confined to the 19th century) are [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] with eight wins spread across 120 years. There have been 15 Old Firm finals, although never two in consecutive years, while there have been just 40 finals involving neither Rangers or Celtic, 17 of which were in the 19th century. After the [[1928 Scottish Cup final|1928 final]], there was no Old Firm meeting again for 28 editions until [[1963 Scottish Cup final|1963]], although an additional seven years had elapsed due to World War II when the cup was not contested.

The longest run of Old Firm wins is 11, between [[1970–71 in Scottish football|1971]] and [[1980–81 in Scottish football|1981]], while the longest sequence of other winners since Celtic's formation is 5, between [[1954–55 in Scottish football|1955]] and [[1958–59 in Scottish football|1959]].

Rangers' sudden removal from the upper echelons of the Scottish game in 2012 led to a more diverse list of finalists in both cups; the expected Celtic monopoly of all competitions did not occur in the knockout formats and there were several maiden trophy wins for clubs such as [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]], [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness CT]] and [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]]. However, after [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] broke a 114-year 'curse' in 2016, Celtic won the next four editions in succession, the longest winning sequence in the competition's long history.

==Women's football==
The Rangers–Celtic rivalry in women's football has existed only in the 21st century, with [[Rangers W.F.C.]] having formed in 2008, one year after the [[Celtic F.C. Women]]. Fixtures between the teams generate additional media interest due to their association with the parent clubs, and are referred to as ''Old Firm'' matches as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womenssoccerscene.co.uk/womens-football-news-2009-2010/091102-02.htm|title=Celtic storm back to top|website=Women's Soccer Scene|date=2 November 2009|access-date=4 June 2018|archive-date=3 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903151158/http://www.womenssoccerscene.co.uk/womens-football-news-2009-2010/091102-02.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17722676|title=Celtic women win Old Firm cup tie|work=BBC Sport|date=15 April 2012|access-date=4 June 2018|archive-date=27 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027192404/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17722676|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22834972|title=Rangers beat Celtic in a women's game for first time|work=BBC Sport|date=10 June 2013|access-date=4 June 2018|archive-date=27 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127231635/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22834972|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43026233|title=SWPL: Celtic begin season with win over Rangers|work=BBC Sport|date=11 February 2018|access-date=4 June 2018|archive-date=6 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406110035/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43026233|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://rangers.co.uk/news/women/clark-relishing-old-firm-clash/|title=Clark Relishing Old Firm Clash|publisher=Rangers F.C.|date=1 June 2018|access-date=4 June 2018|archive-date=3 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903151048/https://rangers.co.uk/news/women/clark-relishing-old-firm-clash/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://shekicks.net/2018/06/03/sbsswpl-rangers-women-win-old-firm-derby/|title=SWPL: Rangers Women win Old Firm derby|website=SheKicks|date=3 June 2018|access-date=4 June 2018|archive-date=18 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718222009/https://shekicks.net/2018/06/03/sbsswpl-rangers-women-win-old-firm-derby/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=womensep18/> On 13 April 2016, Celtic women's team played their first competitive match at Celtic Park, marking the occasion with a 5–1 victory over Rangers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celticfc.net/news/10340|publisher=Celtic F.C.|date=13 April 2016|access-date=3 September 2018|title=Derby delight for the Hoops in Paradise|archive-date=15 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715181316/http://www.celticfc.net/news/10340|url-status=live}}</ref> During the [[2019 Scottish Women's Premier League|2019 season]], sisters Kodie and [[Brogan Hay]] played on opposite sides in the fixture.<ref name=kodiedream>[https://celticfcwomen.celticfc.net/news/first-team/living-the-dream Living the dream] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222003101/https://celticfcwomen.celticfc.net/news/first-team/living-the-dream |date=22 February 2020 }}, Celtic FC, 18 April 2019</ref><ref>[https://rangers.co.uk/news/women/we-have-a-point-to-prove/ We Have A Point To Prove] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029003556/https://rangers.co.uk/news/women/we-have-a-point-to-prove/ |date=29 October 2019 }}, Rangers FC, 26 October 2019</ref>
