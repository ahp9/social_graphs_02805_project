A '''pitch invasion''' (also known as '''field storming''', '''rushing the field''' or '''rushing the court''') occurs when a person or a crowd of people spectating a sporting event run onto the competition area, usually to celebrate or protest an incident, or sometimes as a [[publicity stunt]]. Consequences for participants can result in criminal charges, fines or prison time, and sanctions against the club involved, especially if they cause a disruption in play, although they may sometimes be more welcomed if a large portion of the spectators invades the pitch simultaneously outside of playing time.

This is especially common in [[college football|college]] and [[high school football]] when a team pulls off a major upset, defeats a major rival, ends a long [[losing streak]] or notches a history-making win.  With the widespread advent of artificial turf, some schools have become more lenient about students storming the field. In the last few years{{when?|date=September 2025}}, goalposts are also taken down within moments of the end of the game as a cautionary measure to prevent fans from climbing atop them to cause damage to the standard holding them up, damage to television camera equipment on the posts, and spectator injury. In the [[National Football League]], rushing the field usually results in a lifetime revocation of [[season ticket]]s, even if given or sold to another person, along with a lifetime [[Trespass to land|trespass]]ing notice banning the rusher from the team and/or stadium property, or in cases of multiple rushes, other league stadiums.

===Incidents===
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* [[Chicago College All-Star Game]] (23 July 1976): with 1:22 remaining in the third quarter, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] led the College All-Stars 24–0 when a torrential rainstorm hit the field which made play impossible. After officials called for a delay, drunk and unruly fans invaded the field and tore down the goalposts. Officials, security, and police attempted to clear the field, but twelve minutes later, [[National Football League|NFL]] Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] and the sponsoring [[Chicago Tribune]] announced that the game had been called, which was greeted with jeers, and numerous brawls broke out on the flooded field before order was finally restored.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmbolding.com/BSR/The_Chicago_All-Star_Game_1976.htm|title=Unconfigured Site|access-date=14 June 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222932/http://www.mmbolding.com/BSR/The_Chicago_All-Star_Game_1976.htm|archive-date=3 March 2016}}</ref>
* [[Muscatine High School]] (8 September 1978): a [[high school football]] example, where fans celebrated the end of a long losing streak, as the Muskies had lost 44 consecutive games from 1973 to 1977, including 40 straight league games in the [[Mississippi Valley Conference (Iowa)|Mississippi Valley Conference]]. Optimism was high that the Muskies, now members of the newly formed [[Mississippi Athletic Conference|Mississippi Eight Conference]], would end their five-year-long losing streak sometime during the 1978 season, but it was in the season opener on the road against Ottumwa that Muscatine won their first game since the 1973 season opener. A touchdown with just over a minute left and a two-point conversion put Muscatine ahead with a 15–12 lead. Ottumwa advanced the ball to the Muskie 33-yard line on the ensuing series, but was intercepted in the Muskie end zone with two seconds left. As soon as time expired, more than 1,000 Muskie fans rushed the field to celebrate its first win in 45 contests; an attempt to tear down the goalposts was not successful.<ref>Bates, Roger, "Thank God it's over!" ''[[Muscatine Journal]]'', 9 September 1978.</ref>
* [[Buffalo Bills]] v [[Miami Dolphins]] (7 September 1980, NFL): the Bills broke a 20-game losing streak against their division rival, the Dolphins, on this day, prompting the 79,000 fans in attendance at [[Rich Stadium]] to storm the field and tear down the stadium's goalposts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/buffalo-bills/09000d5d8208e8a1/Bills-stop-skid-vs-Dolphins|title=Bills stop skid vs. Dolphins|website=[[NFL.com]] |access-date=14 June 2016}}</ref>
* [[1982 California Golden Bears football team|California]] v [[1982 Stanford Cardinal football team|Stanford]] (20 November 1982, [[Pac-12 Conference|Pacific-10]] [[American football|football]]):  in the final seconds of the 1982 [[Big Game (football)|Big Game]] against the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (Cal), [[Stanford Band]] members and Stanford players ran out onto the field, thinking the game was over. Cal players [[lateral pass|lateralled]] the kickoff back and forth, with Cal's Kevin Moen dodging through the band for a winning touchdown, which he ended by running over trombone player Gary Tyrrell in the end zone. "[[The Play (Stanford vs. California)|The Play]]" is celebrated by Cal fans and inspires the ire of many Stanford fans. To this day, it remains one of the most famous plays in American football history. (The game does not end until the last play ends, even if the game clock runs out of time while the last play is still in progress.  A penalty was called as a result of "The Play", but it was only because the spectators and band members had crowded onto the field while the game was in progress.)
* [[Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars|Philadelphia Stars]] v [[Michigan Panthers]] (17 July 1983, [[United States Football League|USFL]] [[American football|football]]) [[1983 USFL Championship Game|USFL Championship Game]]: after dropping four out of five games to start their first season in the new league, Michigan acquired some NFL veterans to finish the year 12-6 and vaulted over the Oakland Invaders in the single-tier playoffs. In front of a crowd of 46,565 paid attendees at [[Mile High Stadium]] in [[Denver]], the Panthers' late drive for a touchdown moved victory out of reach for the Stars, beating them 24–22.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lopresti|first1=Mike|title=Panthers a mile high, take first USFL championship – on Newspapers.com|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4099652/panthers_a_mile_high_take_first_usfl/|access-date=22 January 2016|work=The San Bernardino County Sun|agency=Gannet News Service|date=18 July 1983|ref=USFLchamp83GAN}}</ref> Despite the neutral ground afforded by a Super Bowl-style championship where the venue is selected in advance of the playoffs, several hundred Michigan fans stormed the field and congregated in the area of the south stands and south goalpost. Fans briefly mounted the goalpost, nearly breaking it down, and missiles, notably bottles, were hurled by fans at [[Denver Police Department|Denver Police]], who responded with [[K-9 (police)|K-9 enforcement]], mace and batons. In the melee, 12 fans were arrested by police, half from Michigan.<ref>{{cite news|title=18 July 1983|page=18|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=4099652|access-date=22 January 2016|work=The San Bernardino County Sun|agency=Associated Press|date=18 July 1983|ref=USFLchamp83AP}}</ref>
* [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] v [[2002 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]] (9 November 2002, [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] [[American football|football]]): Kentucky looked as if they would pull off a home upset of the Tigers when they held a 30–27 lead with two seconds left and LSU with the ball at their own 26-yard line. As [[quarterback]] [[Marcus Randall]] heaved a [[Hail Mary pass]] downfield, fans rushed onto the edges of the field ready to celebrate Kentucky's victory. However, the pass was deflected off two Wildcat defenders and into the hands of LSU [[wide receiver]] [[Devery Henderson]], who was able to run into the [[end zone]] to cap a 33–30 win for LSU and leaving the fans on the field stunned at the turn of events. The play would come to be known as the [[Bluegrass Miracle]]. Five years later, at the same stadium, Wildcats fans invaded the field after avenging the loss with a thrilling triple-overtime win, and the school was fined $50,000 for a third violation of the conference's policy prohibiting field storming (see below).
*[[2008 Texas vs. Texas Tech football game|Texas Tech v Texas]] (2 November 2008): Texas Tech fans invaded the [[Jones AT&T Stadium]] turf three times during the final moments of the game. The first happened after [[Michael Crabtree]] caught a touchdown pass from [[Graham Harrell]] with one second to go: overjoyed fans, thinking the game was over and the [[2008 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|Red Raiders]] had upset [[2008 Texas Longhorns football team|#1-ranked Texas]], spilt out onto the field, doing so again after the replay official announced that Crabtree had indeed stayed inbounds the moment before crossing the goal line. Tech was assessed two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties for this, forcing them to kick off from the 7-and-a-half yard line. After the ball was recovered by Tech, the game ended and the fans stormed the field one final time without penalty.
* [[Kick Six|Auburn v Alabama]] (30 November 2013): [[2013 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn University]] faced off against their arch-rivals, the [[2013 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|University of Alabama]] in their annual rivalry game, popularly known as the [[Iron Bowl]]. Alabama entered the season ranked No. 1 after winning two consecutive BCS National Championships. Auburn had begun the season unranked but had moved up to No. 4 in the rankings, marking the second time both teams were ranked in the Top 5 of the BCS rankings. The winner of the game would earn the right to play in the [[2013 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]]. With one second left on the clock and the score tied, Alabama elected to attempt a 57-yard field goal. The kick was short and Auburn defender [[Chris Davis (cornerback)|Chris Davis]] fielded it from nine yards deep in his own end zone. He returned the kick all the way to the Alabama end zone, scoring the game-winning touchdown, in a play known as the [[Kick Six]].  In spite of the SEC's penalties for rushing the field, thousands of Auburn fans (mainly students) flooded the field in delight at earning a spot in the SEC Championship game, as well as ending arch-rival Alabama's [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national title]] hopes. Following the game, the Auburn grounds crew discovered that among the debris left on the field was a pile of cremains on the Auburn sideline, assumed to be placed there by a fan honoring a deceased relation's request to have his ashes scattered on the field. (Traditionally, sports teams rarely permit "burials" on their fields in order to protect the health of the turf: if so, it is almost always an important club figure whose remains are scattered, or are properly buried and interred below the turf during a maintenance period.)
*[[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] v [[Virginia Cavaliers football|Virginia]] (26 September 2025): Virginia fans raided the Scott Stadium field after the Cavaliers upset the eighth-ranked Seminoles in double overtime, 46–38.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/46392654/virginia-prevails-2ot-florida-state-end-zone-bobble|publisher=ESPN|title=Virginia stuns No. 8 Florida State in 2OT as fans storm field|date=September 27, 2025|access-date=September 30, 2025}}</ref>

===Southeastern Conference penalties===
Section 10.5 of the [[Southeastern Conference]] By-Laws has a progressive fine policy adopted in 2004 for major sports: $5,000 for the first offense, $25,000 for the second offense, and $50,000 for third and subsequent offenses within a three-year period of the last field storming. In May 2015, the fines increased to $50,000; $100,000; and $250,000 for the first, second, and third plus subsequent offenses, respectively, with a period for past violations being increased from three years to five. In 2023, the fines were respectively further increased to $100,000; $250,000; and $500,000 and changed so the fine would be paid to the opposing institution for conference games (nonconference games continued to have the fine paid to the SEC's scholarship fund), with each team also being given a clean slate. Since 2025, SEC schools are fined $500,000 for every field- or court-storming offense.

Generally for an [[Upset (competition)|upset situation]] however, the fine (which in college sports is usually a donation to a conference's scholarship fund rather than a punitive payment, as is the course for the SEC) is taken as a "badge of honor" by the school and its fanbase that knows the cost of storming well in advance, and fans and the school's [[booster club]] proudly donate the funds to a school's athletic department needed to pay the fine, along with the secondary cost for the replacement of damaged or removed goalposts.

The [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky Wildcats]] were hit with "the triple" for three football field stormings within eleven months, involving [[upset (competition)|upset]] wins against league powers and an in-state rival:
* On 4 November 2006, the team was fined $5,000 for a field invasion after a football win against [[2006 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]].
* On 15 September 2007, the team was fined $25,000 for a storming after a football non-conference win against [[Governor's Cup (Kentucky)|archrival]] [[2007 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]].
* On 13 October 2007, the team was fined $50,000 for a field rush after a triple-overtime football win against top-ranked [[2007 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/news/?ArticleId=9813|title=SEC Football Clubhouse – Latest Headlines, Standings, Schedule, and Leaders|access-date=14 June 2016}}</ref>

Vanderbilt, South Carolina, and Missouri had been fined $25,000 for second offense violations, but most SEC schools were fined $5,000. Missouri's fine is notable in that their second violation occurred after only three years as a member of the SEC: both came when supporters flooded [[Faurot Field]] after the team clinched a trip to the [[SEC Championship Game]], in [[2013 Missouri Tigers football team|2013]] and [[2014 Missouri Tigers football team|2014]].

[[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] was fined $100,000 for a second offense following its victory October 13, 2018, against [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]]. Its first offense was October 25, 2014, following a victory over [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]], drawing just a $5,000 fine. LSU fans twice tore down the goalposts in [[2000 LSU Tigers football team|2000]], following victories over [[2000 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee]] and [[2000 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]], but did not invade the [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]] field again until 2014. The goalposts remained intact during the 2014 and 2018 incidents.

[[Auburn Tigers|Auburn]] became the first SEC institution to be fined the maximum of $250,000, following its football victory over [[Alabama Crimson Tide|Alabama]] on November 25, 2017. This came on top of violations following Auburn victories over Alabama in football in [[Kick Six|2013]] and Kentucky in men's basketball in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/auburn-football/sec-fines-auburn-250000-rushing-field-iron-bowl-win/|title=SEC fines Auburn $250,000 for rushing field after Iron Bowl win|date=25 November 2017|publisher=Saturday Down South|access-date=25 November 2017}}</ref> Auburn was fined another $250,000 after fans stormed the field following its [[Iron Bowl]] victory on November 30, 2019.

[[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] was fined $250,000 when its fans stormed the field after a victory over [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]] on September 11, 2021. Two weeks later, [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] was hit with a $250,000 fine following a victory over [[Florida Gators football|Florida]], the Wildcats' first home win over the Gators since 1986.

In 2022, [[2022 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]] was hit with two $250,000 fines following successive home wins over [[2022 Ole Miss Rebels football team|Ole Miss]] and [[2022 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]. The goalposts remained standing following both incidents.

[[2023 Missouri Tigers football team|Missouri]] became the first institution to be fined $100,000 for a first offense following a last-second upset win over #15 [[2023 Kansas State Wildcats football team|Kansas State]] after the game ended on an SEC record 61-yard successful field goal. [[2023 Ole Miss Rebels football team|Ole Miss]] became the second two weeks later when it defeated [[2023 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]]. The Rebels were fined an additional $75,000 for fans throwing debris onto the field at various times during the game.

On October 5, 2024, both Arkansas and Vanderbilt scored upset victories over then-#4 Tennessee and then-#1 Alabama, respectively, resulting in field invasions. This marked the first instance that two top 5 SEC teams lost to unranked conference opponents in the same day. The schools were fined $250,000 and $100,000, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/vanderbilt-and-arkansas-receive-six-figure-fines-after-fans-storm-the-field-in-upset-wins-172211862.html|title=Vanderbilt and Arkansas receive six-figure fines after fans storm the field in upset wins|publisher=Yahoo!|date=October 7, 2024|access-date=October 8, 2024}}</ref>

LSU was assessed a $250,000 fine when fans rushed the field after another victory against Ole Miss on October 12, 2024.

Texas and LSU were each fined $250,000 by the SEC in 2024 for fans throwing debris onto the field during losses by their respective football teams, the Longhorns vs. Georgia (October 19) and the Tigers vs. Alabama (November 9). The SEC also mandated both universities identify offenders and ban them from all athletic events for the remainder of the 2024–25 school year.

Ole Miss was fined $350,000 after its November 9, 2024 win vs. Georgia for another field invasion—$250,000 for a second offense and an extra $100,000 for fans entering the playing field before the end of the game.

[[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]] was assessed its first fine of $100,000 as an SEC member when fans stormed the [[Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium]] gridiron after the Sooners' win over Alabama on November 23, 2024. Like Ole Miss two weeks prior, Oklahoma was fined an additional $100,000 because its fans came on the field before the game ended.

Missouri was fined $250,000 when fans rushed the court at [[Mizzou Arena]] after the [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|men's basketball team]] defeated [[Border War (Kansas–Missouri rivalry)|archrival]] [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]] on December 8, 2024. ([[Creighton Bluejays men's basketball|Creighton]] fans rushed the court at [[CHI Health Center Omaha]] four days earlier when the Bluejays defeated the Jayhawks, but the [[Big East Conference]] does not fine schools for court invasions.)

Vanderbilt became the first SEC institution to be fined $500,000 for a third court invasion following its [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|men's basketball]] win over Kentucky on January 25, 2025. This came one week following the Commodores' men's basketball upset victory over in-state rival Tennessee that drew a $250,000 second pitch invasion fine.

[[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State]] was also fined $500,000 for a field storming after its upset win over [[Arizona State Sun Devils football|Arizona State]] on September 6, 2025.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/46201308/mississippi-state-fined-500000-sec-field-storming|publisher=ESPN|date=September 8, 2025|access-date=September 8, 2025|title=Mississippi State fined $500,000 by SEC for field storming}}</ref>

===Atlantic Coast Conference penalties===
Beginning with the 2025–26 academic year, the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) issued a new event security policy that discourages fans from storming the field or court until the visiting team and game officials have safely exited the playing area. Member schools are fined $50,000 for the first offense, $100,000 for the second offense, and $200,000 for the third and subsequent offenses over a two-year period from the field storming, with the fines being directed to the conference's postgraduate scholarship fund.

On August 30, 2025, [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] upset Alabama at [[Doak Campbell Stadium]], 31–17. The school was fined $50,000 for the subsequent field invasion by Seminoles fans. This is the first ACC fine for a field storming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/46131359/florida-state-fined-50k-acc-storming-field-alabama-win|title=Florida State fined $50K by ACC for storming field after Alabama win|date=September 1, 2025|accessdate=September 2, 2025|publisher=ESPN}}</ref>

===Other conference penalties===
Other conferences have similar bylaws; in some conferences, the rule is reset to zero after five years without a field storming, and the fine is doubled in the event that a player or official is injured as a result of the invasion.

However, more recently{{when?|date=September 2025}}, some conferences have begun cracking down on stormings in all sports.

===Tearing down the goalposts===

There has long been a tradition in American football – primarily in college football – under which fans celebrating a major victory will tear down the goalposts on the field after the game.<ref>Darren Rovell, [https://www.espn.com/sportsbusiness/s/2002/1120/1463785.html The ultimate form of fan participation], ESPN.com (20 November 2002).

Tearing down the goalposts can be dangerous, however, as people can be injured or killed by a falling goal post.  Persons who sit or hang on the goalposts while they are being pulled down can be injured if they fall off or if they land hard on the ground when the goalposts collapse. Camera equipment from a game broadcaster attached to the goalposts results in another injury possibility.  These dangers can create legal implications for the schools, the localities, and the venues where the games occur.<ref>David LaVetter & Yun Seok Choi, [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/implications-of-toppling-goal-posts-in-college-football.pdf?c=jsas;idno=6776111.0002.107 Implications of Toppling Goal Posts in College Football: Managing Institutional Risk], ''Journal of Sport Administration & Supervision'', Volume 2, Issue 1, April 2010.

In [[Massachusetts]], there is a state statute that specifically prohibits the unauthorized tearing down of goalposts on a football field.  Chapter 266, Section 104A of the [[General Laws of Massachusetts|Massachusetts General Laws]] provides: "Whoever willfully and without right destroys, injures or removes a goal post on a football field shall be punished by a fine of not less than fifty nor more than two hundred dollars."<ref>[https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter266/Section104A Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 266, Section 104A], from the website of the [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts state legislature]].

In spite of the law, on 22 December 1985, fans of the [[New England Patriots]] tore down a goal post in [[Sullivan Stadium]] (also in Foxborough) to celebrate the team's victory there in the regular season finale against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], which clinched a playoff berth (and eventual [[Super Bowl XX|Super Bowl appearance]]) for the Patriots.  Some fans carried the goal post outside of the stadium, where they caused it to come into contact with an overhead high-voltage power line.  A man nearby, Jon Pallazola, was seriously injured.  There was evidence that he was injured when he tried to protect himself from being hit by the falling goal post immediately after it became electrified.  Pallazola subsequently sued a private security company that had been under contract to provide security at the stadium.  He received a large jury verdict against the company, and then settled his claim against the company for $4.5 million.  He also sued the Town of Foxborough but, in 1994, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] ruled that his claim against the town was barred by a state statute that gave municipalities immunity from claims that they failed to provide police protection or prevent crimes.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=640+N.E.2d+460&hl=en&as_sdt=20000006&case=2218433522576570264&scilh=0 Pallazola v.

[[File:River Plate Supporters 1945.jpg|thumb|[[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] supporters invade the field during the [[1945 Argentine Primera División|1945 league title]].]]
[[File:Sheffield Wednesday Pitch invasion 5th May 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] fans invade the pitch to celebrate promotion to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] on 5 May 2012.]]
Pitch invasions are not uncommon but not as frequent nowadays in top-level football, but historically it was common for the supporters of the winning team in a major match, such as a Cup Final, to flood onto the pitch after the final whistle. For example, in [[Kenneth Wolstenholme]]'s famous "Some people are on the pitch, [[they think it's all over]]⁠{{nowrap|{{px2}}{{mdash}}{{px2}}}}it is now!" comment on the BBC's television coverage of the [[1966 World Cup Final]]. "They" were fans who had encroached onto the pitch before the end of [[overtime (sports)|extra time]].

Counterintuitively, despite the fact that the 1970s and 1980s were a time where fans were barricaded in the stands by the use of fences, pitch invasions were not uncommon; when the barricading form of crowd control was abandoned after the 1989 [[Hillsborough disaster]], pitch invasions became rarer.

Several reasons may account for the decline in pitch invasions. After the Hillsborough disaster, [[terrace (stadium)|terraces]] were required to be converted into [[all-seater]] stands, from which it is somewhat more difficult for spectators to physically rush down in order to reach the {{nowrap|pitch{{px2}}{{mdash}}{{px2}}}}especially in large numbers, and from higher rows of seats. Moreover, pitch invasions were criminalised in 1991 in the UK under the Football Offences Act.<ref name="FootballOffencesAct001">{{Cite news|title=Football (Offences) Act 1991|publisher=[[legislation.gov.uk]]|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/19/section/4|access-date=2013-12-12 }}</ref> There is also the concurrent and substantial increase in the cost of tickets, especially for seating in the lower rows, leading to these seats increasingly being occupied by wealthier fans who are much less inclined to risk legal, professional or other consequences which could arise from invading the pitch.

Pitch invasions still do occur, however, especially in the lower divisions, where terraces are still permitted, tickets are much less expensive, and there is less policing and security.

=== Notable pitch invasions ===
* [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] v [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] (17 April 1909) [[1909 Scottish Cup Final|Scottish Cup final replay]]. At the end of the drawn replay, the crowd invaded the pitch to protest at the lack of a result and at the prospect of having to pay to watch a third game. The SFA withheld the Cup.
* [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] v [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] (14 May 1966) [[1966 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]]. Sheffield Wednesday had scored two goals while Everton had a goal disqualified as offside before Everton scored two goals in the second half to equalise. Shortly after the equalising goal Everton fan Eddie Canavagh invaded the pitch, eluding one police officer before being tackled and escorted off the pitch by a second officer. Everton went on to win the game 3–2. 
* [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] v [[Inter Milan]] (25 May 1967) [[1967 European Cup Final|European Cup final]]. As the final whistle blew, fans of Celtic flooded the pitch in jubilation as Celtic became the first British team to lift the European Cup.
* [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] v [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] (5 February 1972) [[FA Cup]]. [[Hereford United 2–1 Newcastle United|Non-league Hereford beat top-flight Newcastle 2–1 after extra time]]. There were pitch invasions after both Hereford goals and one at the end of the match.
* [[Manchester United]] v [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] (27 April 1974) [[1973–74 Football League#First Division|Football League First Division]]. There were pitch invasions a few minutes after [[Denis Law]] scored the only goal for the visiting team, in a match that would have given United hope of staying in the old First Division had they won as it was the second to last game of the season. Although United's fate was not sealed with that goal, the pitch invasion confirmed it as the match was abandoned 8 minutes before playing time had expired, along with negative results elsewhere.
* [[England national football team|England]] v [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] (4 June 1977) [[British Home Championship|Home International]]. Scotland won 2–1 with goals from [[Gordon McQueen]] and [[Kenny Dalglish]] in the match played at the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|old Wembley]]. At the final whistle, Scotland supporters invaded the pitch and destroyed one of the goals. The scenes were broadcast live on UK TV, and this is identified as one of the key moments when [[football hooliganism]] caught the interest of politicians.
* [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] v [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] (10 May 1980) [[1980 Scottish Cup Final|Scottish Cup final]]. Celtic beat Rangers 1–0 during extra time and rioting ensued on the pitch at full-time. Mounted police had to break up the battling fans; this also led to the banning of alcohol from Scottish football grounds.
* [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] v [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] (14 May 1983) [[1982–83 Football League#Second Division|Football League Second Division]]. This match was controversially never concluded after Derby fans invaded the pitch. Fulham required a win to be promoted back into the top flight of English football but despite their protests the match was never replayed and the result, a 1–0 defeat, stood.
* [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] v [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] (7 May 1994). In an attempt to secure 40 consecutive years of top-flight football, Everton, who had been at the foot of the table for much of a dreadful season, needed to beat the in-form Wimbledon, who had not lost for 10 games in a row. The club's chairman had offered a trip to Las Vegas if they should make it 11. Despite one stand being closed due to construction the atmosphere was known as one of the greatest ever within Goodison Park. Although they went 2–0 down in the first 20 minutes, Everton managed a remarkable comeback to win the game 3–2 and secure survival. A mass pitch invasion ensued and many images of the emotional day were screened on the BBC's ''[[Grandstand (BBC)|Grandstand]]''.
* [[Carlisle United]] v [[Plymouth Argyle]] (8 May 1999). Having been bottom of the table for much of the season, Carlisle United needed a win to stand any chance of possible survival and retain their Football League status. With the score at 1–1 against Plymouth in injury time, on-loan goalkeeper [[Jimmy Glass]] came forward from his own half into the opposition box for the subsequent Carlisle corner kick. The ball met Glass on a rebound shot and he kicked into the net to score, winning the match and condemning [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]] to relegation in the process. A mass pitch invasion took place before the match ended.
* [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]] v [[SpVgg Unterhaching|Unterhaching]] (19 May 2001). Before the last round of matches of the [[2000–01 Fußball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga 2000–01 season]], Bayern Munich led Schalke 04 by three points, but with an inferior goal difference. Schalke managed to defeat Unterhaching 5–3 in their final match at the [[Parkstadion]]. Shortly before this match ended, Bayern gave up a 90th-minute goal against Hamburg. Most Schalke supporters believed their team had won their first championship since 1958. The pitch had thus been stormed in celebration although the match in Hamburg was not concluded yet. In Hamburg, an indirect free kick was awarded for Bayern and Patrik Andersson eventually scored the decisive equaliser. In Schalke, the atmosphere immediately turned from joy and celebration to shock, disbelief and mourning.
* [[Aston Villa]] v [[Manchester United]] (6 January 2002) [[FA Cup]]. Manchester United were 2–0 down with 15 minutes left of play; however, Manchester United scored three times in 5 minutes and their third goal caused many Manchester United fans to invade the pitch in celebration.
* [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] v [[Luton Town]] (10 September 2002). 10 minutes before the [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] game kicked off, Luton fans invaded the pitch, provoking the Watford fans to do the same. A mass brawl on the pitch ensued between the two sets and the game was delayed for 25 minutes before [[riot police]] regained order.<ref name="BBC2249877">

During the game there was an infamous coin throwing incident, and a QPR fan went onto the pitch to remonstrate with the [[referee (association football)|referee]].

* [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] v [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] (15 May 2005) [[FA Premier League]]. West Brom defeated Portsmouth 2–0; combined with other results, this completed one of the most amazing [[FA Premier League 2004-05#The relegation dog fight|escapes from relegation]] in English football history. West Brom became the first team since the advent of the modern [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] in 1992–93 to escape relegation after being bottom of the table at Christmas. Once all results came in and West Brom were secure, thousands of Baggies fans at [[The Hawthorns]] ecstatically ran onto the pitch. Many Portsmouth fans joined the celebrations, as one of the teams relegated instead of West Brom were their arch-rivals [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].
* [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] v [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] (1 April 2006) [[Football League Championship]]. Reading defeated Derby County 5–0 to secure the [[Football League Championship]] title. In the previous game [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] drew 1–1 with [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] at the [[Walkers Stadium]] to secure promotion to the [[FA Premier League]] for their first season in the top flight during their 135-year history. At the end of the game [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] fans spilt onto the pitch to celebrate these two achievements.
* [[Wigan Athletic]] v [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] (29 April 2006) [[FA Premier League]]. Portsmouth defeated [[Wigan Athletic|Wigan]] 2–1 to ensure Portsmouth's survival in the [[FA Premier League]]. Nicknamed "the Great Escape" by Portsmouth fans, this win marked the conclusion to an astonishing series of matches under their manager [[Harry Redknapp]] who had rejoined the club earlier in the year, after being sacked by fierce rivals [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], when Portsmouth were in a deep relegation crisis. It heralded the arrival of Portsmouth's new owner, [[Sacha Gaydamak]], who bankrolled the signings made by [[Harry Redknapp]] during the January transfer window. Portsmouth fans invaded the pitch at the [[DW Stadium]] in jubilation and relief at staying up. This marked the beginning of the saga leading to Portsmouth's relegation and bankruptcy.
* [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] v [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] ([[2009 Upton Park riot|25 August 2009]]) [[Football League Cup]]. After West Ham equalised, fans invaded the pitch but did not cause a major disturbance. After West Ham scored twice more, hundreds of their fans invaded the pitch and riot police were hastily deployed. It took over six minutes for the police to clear the pitch. Sports Minister [[Gerry Sutcliffe]] was quoted as saying that the violence between West Ham and Millwall was "a disgrace to football" and the invasions were widely condemned by the FA and the players.<ref name="Telegraph6093066">

Mounted police cleared the scene shortly afterwards, and 28 Rovers fans were charged for their involvement in the violence surrounding Bristol Rovers' relegation to the Non-League.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epigram.org.uk/sport/2014/10/is-the-only-way-really-up-for-bristol-rovers|title=Is the only way really up for Bristol Rovers?|date=8 October 2014|access-date=10 May 2017}}</ref>

Aston Villa player [[Fabian Delph]] claimed he was bitten by a fan and other players were in danger of being attacked. Aston Villa fans were heavily criticised by the media for their actions with links being drawn to the frequent hooliganism of English football in the 1970s; 17 men were arrested on public offences.

===Post match kick-to-kick===
Spectators on the playing field (i.e., rather than "pitch invasions") have long been a tradition of [[Australian rules football]]. At the end of an Australian rules match, it is traditional for supporters to run onto the field to celebrate the game and play games of [[kick-to-kick]] with their families.

Supporters were once also able to do this during the half-time break. Since 2003, this was subject to stricter controls, and then finally banned altogether in games at Melbourne venues, in the elite [[Australian Football League]]. However, it is still common in suburban and state football leagues like the [[Victorian Football League]] as well as Australian Football League matches in New South Wales and Queensland.

===Landmarks===
It is also common for football fans to engage in ''mid-match'' field invasions when a player reaches a landmark achievement, typically a 100th goal in a season, a 1000th career goal, or in the case of [[Tony Lockett]]'s 1300th career goal in 1999, breaking the all-time goal-kicking record. The AFL has not yet succeeded in preventing these mid-match invasions, but players are duly protected by [[bodyguard]]s, teammates and stadium security while supporters flood onto the field.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lance Franklin kicks his 100th goal| date=30 August 2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6cTjUjabw4 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/C6cTjUjabw4 |archive-date=2021-12-13 |url-status=live|via=YouTube|access-date=19 September 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Pitch invasions also occur when significant final occasions occur. For example, pitch invasions occurred after the [[Fitzroy Football Club]]'s final VFL/AFL game in Victoria,<ref>{{cite web |title=Richmond Tigers vs Fitzroy Lions - Round 21 - 1996 - Fitzroy's Last AFL Game In Victoria |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=7345&v=B84hJPMYHRg&feature=youtu.be |website=YouTube | date=30 March 2015 |publisher=Mighty Roar |access-date=18 May 2024}}</ref> as well as after the final AFL match was played at [[Waverley Park]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Miles |first1=Daniel |title=Twenty-five years after Waverley Park's last AFL game, political football moves to Tasmania stadium |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-04/waverley-vfl-afl-park-stadium-twenty-five-years-tasmania/103608408 |website=ABC News |date=3 April 2024 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=18 May 2024}}</ref>

===Streakers===
The outlawed practice of "[[streaking]]" (running naked onto the ground) occurred in some big matches, most famously the performance of Helen d'Amico in the [[1982 VFL Grand Final]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Naked Streaker – 1982 VFL Grand Final|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FYMUSdVbpQ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227053330/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FYMUSdVbpQ |archive-date=2014-02-27 |url-status=dead|via=YouTube|access-date=19 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Female streaker's big change|work=NewsComAu |url=http://www.news.com.au/national/female-streakers-big-change/story-e6frfkp9-1111116079340|publisher=News.com.au|access-date=19 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Frozen In Time: Helen D'Amico wows Richmond-Carlton fans at the 1982 Grand Final|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/frozen-in-time-helen-damico-wows-richmond-carlton-fans-at-the-1982-grand-final/story-fni5f22o-1226726977997|website=Herald Sun|access-date=19 September 2015}}</ref>

===Hostile spectators===
Although violent spectator playing field invasions both during and after matches were not uncommon in the early years of the VFL – and, "spectator behaviour" was [[Port Melbourne Football Club#History|one of the main reasons that the VFA team Port Melbourne was not invited to become one of the VFL's foundation clubs in 1897]] – in more recent times there have been a few occasions of hostile pitch invasions; the most famous of these occurred in the [[1967 Tasmanian State Premiership Final]], when hundreds of Wynyard fans invaded the field and tore down the goalposts to prevent North Hobart full forward David Collins from kicking a goal after the final siren. The Tasmanian Football League declared the match a ''no result'' and withheld the 1967 State Premiership.

Another hostile pitch invasion occurred in an AFL night game between [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] in 1996, when the floodlights at [[Waverley Park]] lost power during the third quarter; fans rioted in the darkness and, coincidentally, also took down the goalposts. After an AFL meeting, the final quarter of the game was played three days later.

===Animals on the playing field===
On 9 May 1914, in the third quarter of the match between the [[Clayton Football Club]], a Melbourne suburban team, and the Clyde Football Club, an enraged bull invaded the playing field. The players and spectators scattered, some vaulting fences into the next-door market garden, with the majority taking shelter in the dressing shed. The bull's first charge at the dressing sheds shook the building. Its second charge smashed the door, but the shed's doorway was too narrow for it to actually enter the room.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article129699142 Scared!, ''(Melbourne) Punch'', (Thursday, 14 May 1914), p.25.]</ref> Those inside maintained a barrage of boots, coats, and everything possible to scare the bull away. Eventually it was removed by a local farmer, who took it to a secure paddock.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article7228749 Football Sensations: Bull Clears the Field: Players and Spectators Run: Shelter in the Dressing Shed", ''The Argus'', (Monday, 11 May 1914), p.9.]</ref><ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article241761999 Football Extraordinary: Bull Clears the Field: Red Guernseys Infuriate Him: Sensational Attack on the Dressing Shed, ''The (Ballarat) Evening Echo'', (Monday, 11 May 1914), p.2.]</ref><ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article143321968 Exciting Football Match: Bull Takes Possession, ''The Australasian'', (Saturday, 16 May 1914), p.34.]</ref><ref>[https://localhistory.kingston.vic.gov.au/articles/20 Keeley, May, "The Bull and the Clayton Football Club", ''Kingston Local History'', 27 June 2018]: note that the article, mistakenly, has the events taking place in 1912.</ref>

In a more humorous modern incident, a pig named "Plugger" was let loose on the ground in round 18, 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/the-day-a-pitchinvading-porker-made-plugger-feel-pig-sick/2006/07/14/1152637868464.html|title=The day a pitch-invading porker made Plugger feel pig sick – AFL – Sport|date=15 July 2006|access-date=14 June 2016}}</ref>

==Baseball==
[[File:BlueJaysPitchInvasion 02.JPG|thumb|Field intrusion at [[Toronto Blue Jays|Blue Jays]] baseball game]]

In modern [[major league baseball|baseball]], the field is typically rushed by one or a small number of [[attention seeking]] fans or pranksters, rather than a large number of people although more-generalized riots have occurred.  Almost universally, intruders will be [[ejection (sports)|ejected]] from the [[baseball park|ballpark]] and potentially banned for life from it, and may also face [[criminal charges]] depending on the nature of the offence.

In cases when a game is broadcast on television and a person or small group runs onto the field, the broadcaster will cut to another camera shot elsewhere in the stadium, to the [[play-by-play announcer|commentators]] in the press box, or to a commercial break instead of focusing on the intruders; this is to avoid giving attention to their behavior, and to discourage imitators who might try the same thing (and as, occasionally, the person is also a [[streaking|streaker]], to avoid showing nudity). Radio play-by-play announcers however will look at it in amusement and add 'color' to the broadcast, as the rusher is not visible in that medium; [[Kevin Harlan]], who is the main play-by-play announcer for the [[NFL on Westwood One]], has been lauded for his colorful descriptions of various field rushers.

Outside game action, teams do allow spectators on the field (usually children) after games, allowing them to either walk around the [[warning track]] and tour the field, or run the bases as part of promotional events, before the grounds crew restricts further intrusion to maintain the field for the next game.

===Incidents===
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* [[New York Yankees]] at [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Washington Senators]] (30 September 1971; [[American League]]). With the Senators preparing to move [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|to the Dallas-Fort Worth area]] the following season, thousands of non-paying spectators entered [[RFK Stadium]] for the Senators' final home game after security left mid-game.  In the top of the ninth inning, with two out and the Senators leading 7–5, several hundred fans ran onto the field, tearing up the turf and stealing bases for souvenirs.  Without security, order could not be restored, and the game was [[Forfeit (baseball)|forfeited]] to the Yankees.
* [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] at [[Atlanta Braves]] (8 April 1974; [[National League (baseball)|National League]]). On this evening, [[Hank Aaron]] hit his 715th home run, breaking the record previously set by [[Babe Ruth]], and two 17-year-old students ran on the field and rounded the bases with him, to Aaron's astonishment and surprise. Though both were quickly caught, there was no malicious intent in the rush as the men merely wanted to congratulate him, and their charges were dropped the next morning.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=5504664|title=Hank Aaron, two fans reunite|date=27 August 2010|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=16 September 2022}}</ref>
* [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] at [[Cleveland Indians]] (4 June 1974; American League). In an effort to increase attendance, the Indians arranged a "[[Ten Cent Beer Night]]" promotion, drawing over 25,000 fans—three times their normal home crowd.  The game itself was plagued by sporadic pitch invasions and objects thrown into the field by inebriated fans.  In the ninth inning, a scuffle between an intruder and Texas outfielder [[Jeff Burroughs]] ended with a riot involving thousands of fans and both teams, and the Indians were forfeited by umpire crew chief [[Nestor Chylak]], who had a chair broken over his head during the melee.
* [[Chicago Cubs]] at [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (25 April 1976; National League). Two protesters, William Thomas and his 11-year-old son, ran into the outfield at [[Dodger Stadium]] and tried to [[flag desecration|set fire]] to an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] they had brought with them. Chicago outfielder [[Rick Monday]] noticed they had placed the flag on the ground and were fumbling with matches and lighter fluid; he then dashed over and grabbed the flag from the ground to thunderous cheers. He handed the flag to Los Angeles pitcher [[Doug Rau]], after which the ballpark police officers arrested the two intruders. When he came up to bat in the next half-inning, he got a standing ovation from the Los Angeles crowd and the big message board behind the left-field bleachers in the stadium flashed the message, "RICK MONDAY... YOU MADE A GREAT PLAY..." He later said, "If you're going to burn the flag, don't do it around me. I've been to too many veterans' hospitals and seen too many broken bodies of guys who tried to protect it."<ref name=flag>{{Cite news |url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060424&content_id=1415977&vkey=news_chc&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc |title=Monday's act heroic after 30 years |publisher=Cubs at MLB.com |first=Ben |last=Platt |date=25 April 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204001843/http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060424&content_id=1415977&vkey=news_chc&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc |archive-date=4 February 2007 }}</ref> On 25 August 2008, Monday (who would be coincidentally traded to the Dodgers the next season and has been a longtime team broadcaster) was presented with an American flag flown over Valley Forge National Historical Park in honor of his 1976 rescue.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Kathy |last=Boccella |title=Player who saved flag from desecration honored |date=26 August 2008 |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |url =http://www.philly.com/philly/news/27422784.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009023918/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/27422784.html |archive-date=9 October 2008 | access-date=2012-03-17 }}</ref>
* [[Kansas City Royals]] at [[New York Yankees]] (14 October 1976; [[1976 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]]). [[Chris Chambliss]] hit a [[walk-off home run]] in game five of the series to send the Yankees to their first [[World Series]] in twelve years, and fans rushed onto the field while Chambliss circled the bases. The scene was so frenetic that Chambliss himself was not even sure he touched home plate in the chaos, and after being asked about this by third baseman [[Graig Nettles]], had to be escorted back onto the field by police after fans had left to step on home plate in view of home plate [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] [[Art Frantz]].
* [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] at [[New York Yankees]] (18 October 1977; [[1977 World Series|World Series]]). With the Yankees leading by a large margin in the top of the ninth inning of the decisive sixth game, despite repeated warnings from public address announcer [[Bob Sheppard]], fans boldly sat on top of the outfield wall intending to rush the field the moment the final out was made. After some fans went so far as to throw firecrackers onto the outfield, Yankees right fielder [[Reggie Jackson]], who had all but secured the Series [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] award by hitting three home runs in the game, was so fearful for his own safety that he had a batting helmet brought out from the dugout prior to the final out. Immediately after the Yankees won the championship, a visibly panicked Jackson was filmed running from the outfield to the dugout at full speed, knocking over at least two spectators along the way.
* [[Detroit Tigers]] at [[Chicago White Sox]] (12 July 1979; American League). In a promotion famously known as [[Disco Demolition Night]] fans were invited to bring [[disco]] records with them to [[Comiskey Park]]. The records would then be destroyed in between games of a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]]. Fans were so caught up in the anti-disco mania that fans stormed the field and a near-riot broke out. The second game had to be cancelled and was eventually [[forfeit (baseball)|forfeited]] by the White Sox.
* [[Kansas City Royals]] at [[Chicago White Sox]] (19 September 2002; American League) Two fans, a father and son, ran onto the field and attacked Royals first base coach [[Tom Gamboa]].<ref>[http://www.greatest21days.com/2014/09/interview-part-3-tom-gamboa-strange-deal.html Interview Part 3: Tom Gamboa, Strange Deal<!-- Bot generated title -->], The Greatest 21 Days</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=It's been 10 years since William Ligue and son attacked Tom Gamboa at Comiskey Park |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/big-league-stew/10-years-since-william-ligue-son-attacked-tom-172223277--mlb.html |website=sports.yahoo.com|date=19 September 2012 }}</ref> The Royals were able to separate the attackers from Gamboa.

===Morganna, the Kissing Bandit===
[[Morganna|Morganna, the Kissing Bandit]] became famous for rushing the field in baseball and other sports from the early 1970s through the 1980s. She rushed the field on numerous occasions and kissed many [[Major League Baseball]] players including [[Nolan Ryan]], [[Pete Rose]], [[Johnny Bench]], [[George Brett]] (twice), [[Steve Garvey]], and [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]<ref>{{Cite magazine | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/pr/subs/siexclusive/07/09/flashback.morganna/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040903183957/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/pr/subs/siexclusive/07/09/flashback.morganna/ | url-status = dead | archive-date = 3 September 2004 | title = Where Are They Now?

==Basketball==
College basketball has a similar phenomenon, known as "'''storming the court'''". This happens for the same reasons any field is rushed.

In high school and some colleges, walking on the court is the only way to exit from the stands. However, there are usually officials and security personnel and laid-out security [[stanchion]]s that limit how far spectators can walk onto the court, at least while players and game officials are still leaving the court. After the 2004 ''[[Malice at the Palace]]'' incident in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], spectators were placed under a league-wide universal [[code of conduct]] that assesses severe penalties for intruding on the court (inclusive of other interference such as object tossing and player obstruction), including arrest, with some college conferences and high school sanctioning bodies also developing their own similar codes of conduct as spectator [[umpire abuse|abuse of officials]] has become more pronounced and visible.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nba.com/nba-fan-code-of-conduct|title=NBA Fan Code of Conduct|work=[[NBA.com]]|access-date=23 July 2025}}</ref>

===Incidents===
[[File:Michael_Field_Caped_Invader.jpg|thumb|Michael Field the caped invader at the Kohl center in Madison Wisconsin.]]
On February 12, 2011, Michael Field, originally of Marshfield, WI, stormed the court of the [[Kohl Center]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] with 18 seconds remaining in the game.  Michael was clad in a red [[Wisconsin Badgers|Wisconsin]] cape and upon rushing the floor, bear-hugged Point Guard Jordan Taylor.  He was detained and lead-off in handcuffs, but he was quickly released after the entire student section rushed the floor 18 seconds later after the [[2004–05 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Badgers]] defeated No. 1 [[2004–05 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|Ohio State]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-02-12 |title=Jordan Taylor fuels Wisconsin's upset over No. 1 Ohio State |url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&id=6116325 |access-date=2025-02-14 |website=ESPN.com |language=en}}</ref>  No one was injured and no charges were filed.  The nickname "Caped Invader" lives on in Wisconsin Basketball lore to this day.

The [[2011–12 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|Indiana University]] men's basketball team defeated the [[2011–12 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|#1 ranked Kentucky Wildcats]] 73–72 on 10 December 2011, after a three-point shot by [[Christian Watford]] with no time left on the clock. Fans at Indiana's [[Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall|Assembly Hall]] filled the court within seconds to create a series of iconic images. ESPN commentator [[Dick Vitale]], who was covering the game for the network, said it was the "best game of the year"<ref>{{cite news|title=Q & A: Dick Vitale's enthusiasm for NCAA tournament is contagious|url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-xpm-2012-mar-13-la-sp-0314-dick-vitale-qa-20120314-story.html|access-date=22 March 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=13 March 2012}}</ref> and that "[t]he atmosphere there was unreal, as I felt the building shaking after Watford hit the shot."<ref>{{cite news|last=Vitale|first=Dick|title=Indiana basketball back on the map|url=https://www.espn.com/espn/dickvitale/story/_/id/7344694/indiana-hoosiers-basketball-back-big-way|access-date=22 March 2012|work=ESPN|date=12 December 2011}}</ref> Watford's shot won an [[ESPY Award]] for [[Best Play ESPY Award|Best Play]].

Hundreds of students from [[2015–16 Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball team|Iowa State University]] stormed the court after the No. 4-ranked Cyclones' 83-82 [[comeback (sports)|come-from-behind]] victory over in-state rival [[2015–16 Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team|Iowa]] 11 December 2015, at [[Hilton Coliseum]] in [[Ames, Iowa]]. In the aftermath, ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' sports columnist Randy Peterson suffered a leg fracture.<ref>"Peterson breaks leg in court-storming incident", ''[[Des Moines Register]]'', 11 December 2015.

That's a great moment. Those college kids ... they've been camping out here (for tickets) for three days. There's only probably 10 schools that do that in the country.

Accessed 12-11-2015.</ref>

Court storming in collegiate athletics came under further scrutiny following a pair of high-profile incidents that occurred during the 2023-24 basketball season. The first involved [[University of Iowa]] women's basketball star [[Caitlin Clark]] colliding with a fan who rushed the court after Ohio State's win over the Hawkeyes in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Several weeks later, [[Kyle Filipowski]] of the [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke Blue Devils]] had to be carried off the court after appearing to suffer an injury from coming into contact with a fan at [[Wake Forest University]]. In the wake of the Filipowski incident, several coaches including Duke's [[Jon Scheyer]] called for the practice to be abolished entirely.<ref>{{cite news|last=Medcalf|first=Myron|title=College coaches, leaders call for court-storming regulations|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/39605709/college-coaches-leaders-call-court-storming-regulations|access-date=26 February 2024|work=ESPN|date=26 February 2024}}</ref> Meanwhile, [[ESPN]] analyst [[Jay Bilas]] indicated that fans who engage in such conduct should face criminal penalties. “There's no accountability for this," he argued. "The fans feel like it's an entitlement. And the universities like it. And the truth is, we like it.”<ref>{{cite news|last=Bucholtz|first=Andrew|title=ESPN's Jay Bilas suggests arresting fans who rush the court: 'Court stormings will stop the next day.'|url=https://awfulannouncing.com/college-basketball/jay-bilas-espn-arrest-court-stormers.html|access-date=26 February 2024|publisher=Awful Announcing|date=26 February 2024}}</ref>

The [[2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup]] in the [[Philippines]] had a court storming incident. Prior to the start of the [[New Zealand men's national basketball team|New Zealand]] vs [[United States men's national basketball team|United States]] game at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]] in [[Pasay]] on 26 August 2023, a ticket-paying fan wearing a full New Zealand jersey stormed the court. He was stopped after the New Zealand bench informed the organizers that the fan was not part of their team.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Felix,Andrei; Dy, Erika  |date=28 August 2023 |title=Assessing PH's Hosting of 2023 FIBA World Cup |trans-title= |type=broadcast |language= en, fil|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExzrCfbDcrE |access-date= |format= |time=2:30-3:30 |location= |department=[[Sports Desk (Philippine TV program)|Sports Desk]]|work=CNNPhilippines |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |via=YouTube}}</ref>

===High schools===
Although not as well publicized as college incidents, fans storming the court after a big win is not uncommon at the high school level. The injuries suffered by several people following the Iowa State University men's basketball team's win over the University of Iowa in December 2015 prompted the [[Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union]] to issue a memorandum to athletic directors and coaches to remind fans that the organization and its sister organization, the Iowa High School Athletic Association, have policies prohibiting court storming after post-season games. "I have to wonder if the person injured was the star player, the coach, or one of the game officials if the attitude and need for 'storming the court' might change?" wrote IGHSAU executive director Mike Dick.<ref>Eslinger, Jason, "A Note from the Executive Director: Storming the Court: Don't Do It!"

==Cricket==
{{See also|Sydney Riot of 1879}}

It used to be a common occurrence at the end of [[cricket]] [[Test cricket|Test matches]] for the crowd to invade the pitch to watch the presentation from the pavilion balcony. In the UK, this tradition ended in 2001 after a steward was injured in a pitch invasion at a [[one-day cricket|one-day match]] between England and Pakistan.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1393761.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Steward hurt in cricket chaos | date=17 June 2001}}</ref> Invading the pitch can now warrant a £1,000 fine and a lifetime ban from the ground. Post-match presentations are now held on the field or in a room within the venue restricted from public access and displayed on a video [[scoreboard]] if available.

In August 1975, vandals protesting the imprisonment of alleged armed robber [[George Davis (armed robber)|George Davis]] invaded the pitch of the [[Headingley Cricket Ground]] before the final day of the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1975|Third Ashes Test]] between England and Australia, digging holes in the field and covering one end of the pitch in oil. This led to the first-ever declaration of a Test ground being unfit for play, resulting in the match being abandoned and declared a draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/19/newsid_2534000/2534763.stm|title=1975: Davis campaigners stop Test match|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=19 August 1975}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/216592.html|title=Vandals stopped play|work=ESPNcricinfo|date=12 August 2005}}</ref> This was significant as it denied England a chance to tie the series and potentially retain the Ashes; Australia eventually took back the Ashes.

In 1982, a pitch invasion at the [[WACA Ground|WACA]] led to Australian bowler [[Terry Alderman]] suffering a shoulder injury when attempting to apprehend one of the intruders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/341460.html|title=A costly tackle|access-date=14 June 2016}}</ref>

Two One Day International matches at the [[Bourda]] ground in [[Georgetown, Guyana]] have had their results disrupted by pitch invasions. In 1993, the crowd invaded on the last ball of a match as the West Indies ran a second run to tie the score against Pakistan; then, in 1999, the crowd invaded on the last ball of a match as Australia ran a third run to tie the score against the West Indies. In both cases, the fielding team had been a chance of effecting a run-out to prevent the tying run, had the crowd not invaded; but in both cases, match referee [[Raman Subba Row]] declared the match to be [[tie (cricket)|tied]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=aussie-may-calls-for-better-security-measures-1999-04-23|title=Aussie May calls for better security measures|date=23 April 1999|access-date=3 March 2012|newspaper=Hurriyet Daily News}}</ref>

==Gaelic football and hurling==
[[File:15 June 2015, Semple Stadium, Thurles 6.jpg|thumb|Cork supporters invade the field at [[Semple Stadium]] after a game, 2014]]
In [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]], both national sports of Ireland, pitch invasions were acceptable and most widely seen at [[Provincial championships|Provincial]] and [[All-Ireland Final (disambiguation)|All-Ireland Final]]s. However, there has only been one occurrence at [[Croke Park]], after the [[2010 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final]], due to a crackdown since 2009 by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]], though they still occur in other stadia around the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the42.ie/gaa-croke-park-pitch-invasions-1005752-Jul2013/|title = GAA set to hold firm on stance on pitch invasions by fans in Croke Park| date=24 July 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the42.ie/gaa-pitch-invasion-1265228-Jan2014/|title = Pitch invasions 'not justifiable in modern society' -- O'Neill| date=15 January 2014 }}</ref>

==International rules football==
[[International rules football]], a hybrid of Aussie Rules and [[Gaelic football]] is not known for pitch invasions; however, a famous one occurred in the first test of the [[2006 International Rules Series]] at [[Pearse Stadium]], [[Galway]] after Ireland defeated Australia.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

==Rugby league==
[[File:Belmore Oval Crowd on the turf.jpg|thumb|Fans allowed onto the pitch of [[Belmore Sports Ground]] following the completion of the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]] vs [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] match in 2022.]]

In [[New South Wales Rugby League]] matches up until the 1980s, spectators often took to the field on the completion of the match within seconds after the final siren. This required the players to navigate through a crowd of people when coming off the field, and the cardboard corner posts were usually taken as "souvenirs".{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

This practice was discouraged when the publicly viewable game clock stopped with five minutes to play in order to ensure that spectators, not knowing when the game was about to finish, could not jump the gun and enter the playing arena with the game unfinished. Eventually the tradition died out, and spectators rarely, if ever, take the field in the present day [[National Rugby League]]; fines of $7000 and lifetime bans exist for those who do so.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Pitch invasions have sometimes occurred in [[Hull Derby]] fixtures between [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] (Hull KR) and [[Hull FC]] in northern England. Following the conclusion of a derby match at Hull KR's [[Craven Park, Hull|Craven Park]] on 9 July 2007, in which Hull FC with a 30–20 scoreline, a small number Hull FC fans ran onto the pitch from the South Terrace to congratulate their players. Some Hull KR fans then ran onto the pitch in retaliation, resulting in four arrests for [[Public-order crime|public order]] offences, FC [[Rugby league positions#Centre|centre]] [[Kirk Yeaman]] being headbutted and FC captain [[Lee Radford]] being spat at.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wilson |first1=Andy |title=Hull clubs face fines after weekend crowd trouble |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/10/rugbyleague.hullkr |access-date=16 October 2024 |work=The Guardian |date=10 July 2007 |location=London}}</ref> Hull KR were later fined £7,500 (£5,000 of this suspended) and made to pay legal costs by the [[RFL]] governing body for not controlling spectators at their stadium.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rovers fined after derby trouble |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_league/super_league/hull_kr/7114240.stm |access-date=16 October 2024 |work=BBC Sport |date=26 November 2007}}</ref>

Another pitch invasion occurred at Craven Park in 2015 after Hull FC beat Hull KR 22–12, securing FC a [[2015 Super League season#Playoffs|Super League]] play-off spot.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

==Rugby union==
Pitch invasions have occurred throughout the history of [[rugby union]], with some particular moments being the most infamous. In the past, additional security support has been constructed at stadiums due to foreseen trouble. An early example of this was at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]], when a wire fence was constructed to protect United States players.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Examples===
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* During the [[1971 South Africa rugby union tour of Australia]], hundreds were arrested after they tried to disrupt test matches between the Springboks and [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] in response to South African apartheid policies. Some people even attempted to saw down goalposts and dig trenches in the surface at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] to try to stop a test match going ahead, and in Queensland, a [[state of emergency]] was issued following fears prompted from the behaviour of people at the previous tests. Due to the success of the protests in disrupting the event, the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Cricket Board]] canceled the South African team's imminent tour due to security reasons.
* Perhaps the most infamous of pitch invasions at rugby matches occurred at the [[1981 Springbok tour]] of New Zealand. At Rugby Park in Hamilton (now the site of [[Waikato Stadium]]), 350 people pulled down a fence to invade the pitch, and police were forced to cancel the match after arresting a number of people after they got word that an escaped prisoner was piloting a light plane to fly around the stadium. The last test at [[Eden Park]] in Auckland was disrupted after protesters threw flour bombs and other objects onto the pitch to disrupt the game.
* During a 2002 rugby Tri-Nations match in Durban between South Africa and New Zealand, a drunk South African fan, Pieter van Zyl, scaled a perimeter fence, ran onto the pitch and tackled referee David McHugh, leaving McHugh with a dislocated shoulder and having to be carried from the pitch on a stretcher. Springbok lock, [[AJ Venter]] punched van Zyl and All Blacks flanker [[Richie McCaw]] wrestled him to the ground whereupon police and security arrested him. van Zyl was convicted of trespassing and assault, and was sentenced to three months in jail, fined $275, and banned for life from attending rugby matches in South Africa.
* Another incident involving the South African team took place at the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] in Australia when an intoxicated Samoan fan, with his face painted in the red and blue of the Samoan flag, ran onto the pitch and attempted to tackle Springbok [[Louis Koen (rugby union)|Louis Koen]] as he was kicking a goal in the late stages of a pool match against [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]]. Koen kicked the goal, but also managed to inadvertently knock the fan unconscious with a kick to the head, as the fan had tried to tackle Koen around the legs.
* During a [[2011–12 Top 14 season|2011]] [[Top 14]] match between [[Northern Basque Country|Basque]] rivals [[Biarritz Olympique|Biarritz]] and [[Aviron Bayonnais|Bayonne]], players from both teams were involved in a brief off-the-ball brawl, among them Biarritz' [[Basques|Basque]] star and [[France national rugby union team|France international]] [[Imanol Harinordoquy]]. His father Lucien ran onto the pitch to attempt to defend his son, but was quickly wrestled to the ground by Bayonne players and taken from the pitch. The elder Harinordoquy issued an apology after the match, with his son choosing not to comment on the affair.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/france-top-14-2011-12/rugby/story/155284.html |title=Harinordoquy's father apologises |work=ESPN Scrum |date=30 November 2011 |access-date=2011-11-30}}</ref>

==Arena sports==
Most arena sports (like [[ice hockey]], [[arena football]], and [[indoor soccer]]) take precautions to separate the spectators from the players and to ensure one cannot cross into the other. This is not only for the protection of the players but also the spectators as it also helps prevent pucks, balls, and other objects from flying at speed into spectators, along with the players themselves, and causing injury. Often, in addition to sidewalls, [[Plexiglas]] panels are used as a safety measure. Ice hockey uses the panels around the ice, team benches, and [[penalty box]]es to enforce separation under the rules, and after the [[Death of Brittanie Cecil|death of a young spectator]] in [[Columbus Blue Jackets|Columbus, Ohio]] in 2002, tall netting above the Plexiglas to protect spectators in each shooting end from flying [[hockey puck]]s. Furthermore, the iced surface means stepping onto a hockey rink without [[ice skate|skates]] is dangerous. A few attempts to intrude in arena games have usually ended with physical player intervention.

== Formula One ==
[[File:Silverstone horan.jpg|thumb|Horan invading the track at the [[2003 British Grand Prix]].]]
Several track invasions occurred in [[Formula One]] during the 1990s and 2000s, such as when spectators entered the track after Nigel Mansell won at the [[1992 British Grand Prix]], his home race.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Motor Racing / British Grand Prix '92: Fisa to investigate track |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-british-grand-prix-92-fisa-to-investigate-track-invasion-1533049.html |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20220709112302/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-british-grand-prix-92-fisa-to-investigate-track-invasion-1533049.html |archive-date=2022-07-09 |access-date=2025-06-04 |work=The Independent |language=en-GB}}</ref> The British Grand Prix would also see a track invasion in 2003 from [[Neil Horan]], who went on the track waving a religious banner, which stated "Read the [[Bible]].
