A '''corner kick''', commonly known as a '''corner''', is the method of restarting play in a game of [[association football]] when the ball goes [[out of play]] over the [[Goal line (association football)|goal line]], without a [[Scoring in association football|goal]] being scored and having last been touched by a member of the defending team. The kick is taken from the corner of the [[football (soccer) field|field of play]] nearest to the place where the ball crossed the goal line.

Corners are considered to be a reasonable [[Set piece (football)|goal-scoring opportunity]] for the attacking side, though not as much as a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] or a [[direct free kick]] near the edge of the [[penalty area]].

A corner kick that scores without being touched by another player is called an ''Olimpico goal'',<ref name="Westwood">{{cite web|url=https://www.sportingnews.com/au/football/news/uswnt-star-rapinoe-stuns-matildas-with-olimpico-goal-from-a-corner-in-olympic-bronze-match/p9tmlp33quib1oxny1tz4udzy|title=USWNT star Rapinoe stuns Matildas with 'Olimpico' goal from a corner in Olympic bronze match|last=Westwood|first=James|date=5 August 2021|work=Sporting News|access-date=7 August 2021}}; {{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/what-is-olimpico-goal-which-players-scored-them/1bnn18qlv06b91pb2ahoduf87t|title=What is an 'Olimpico' goal & which players have scored them?|date=5 August 2021|last=Kelly|first=Ryan|work=Goal.com}}</ref> or less commonly, ''Olympic goal''.

==Award==

=== Ball going out of play having been touched last by defending side ===
A corner kick is awarded when the ball wholly crosses the goal line outside of the goal frame having been last touched by a member of the team defending that end of the pitch. For the purposes of this rule, it does not matter if this touch is deliberate; it is permissible to kick the ball at an opponent to win a corner kick.

A corner kick is also awarded instead of an [[own goal]] when the ball enters a team's goal, having been last touched by a member of the defending team, in the following rare situations:
* directly from a kick-off,<ref name="ifab_21_82">{{cite web |url=https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/laws-of-the-game-2021-22?l=en |title=Laws of the Game 21/22 |accessdate=2021-10-14 |page=82}}</ref> free kick (whether direct or indirect),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/laws-of-the-game-2021-22?l=en |title=Laws of the Game 21/22 |accessdate=2021-10-14 |page=113}}</ref> throw-in,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/laws-of-the-game-2021-22?l=en |title=Laws of the Game 21/22 |accessdate=2021-10-14 |page=123}}</ref> goal kick,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/laws-of-the-game-2021-22?l=en |title=Laws of the Game 21/22 |accessdate=2021-10-14 |page=127}}</ref> or corner kick.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://downloads.theifab.com/downloads/laws-of-the-game-2021-22?l=en |title=Laws of the Game 21/22 |accessdate=2021-10-14 |page=131}}</ref>
* from a dropped ball, if the ball has not been touched by at least two players.<ref name="ifab_21_82"/>

The corner kick is taken from whichever corner was closer to the point where the ball went out of play.

=== Goalkeeper not releasing ball in time ===
Beginning in 2025, should a goalkeeper hold on to the ball for more than 8 seconds, a corner kick is awarded to the opposing side from the nearest corner to where this occurred. This rule was implemented to deter [[Running out the clock|time-wasting]] and such penalisations are expected to be rare.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-08-09 |title=Premier League: New season, new laws - what is changing this season? |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c70r0k8kk67o |access-date=2025-08-13 |website=BBC Sport |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Association |first=The Football |title=2025/26 law changes explained |url=http://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/2025-26-law-changes-explained |access-date=2025-08-13 |website=www.thefa.com |language=en}}</ref>

==Procedure==
[[File:BarwellFC.jpg|thumb|Player takes a corner kick]]
* The [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant referee]] will signal that a corner should be awarded by first raising his flag, then using it to point at the corner area on their side of the pitch; however, this is not an indication of which side the kick should be taken from. The referee signals the corner by pointing, with an upward extension of the arm, to the corner area from which the kick is to be taken.
* The ball must be stationary and on the ground within the ''corner area'' formed by a quarter circle with a radius of one yard (1 metre) from the corner flagpost inside the field of play.<ref name="procedure">{{cite web |url=http://www.theifab.com/laws/chapter/37/section/110/ |title=Laws of the Game: Law 17: Corner Kick: Procedure |date=2019 |access-date=22 September 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theifab.com/laws/chapter/21/section/22/ |title=Laws of the Game: Law 1: The Field of Play: The Corner Area |date=2019 |access-date=22 September 2019 }}</ref>
* All opposing players must be at least 10 yards (9.15 metres) from the corner area until the ball is in play. Marks may optionally be made on the goal line and touchline at a distance of 10 yards from the corner area to assist the referee in enforcing this provision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theifab.com/laws/chapter/21/section/17/ |title=Laws of the Game: Law 1: The Field of Play: Field Markings |date=2019 |access-date=22 September 2019 }}</ref>
* The ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves; it does not need to leave the corner area.<ref name="procedure"/>
* The player taking the corner kick may not touch the ball a second time before it has touched another player.<ref name="procedure"/>
* The attacking side may [[#Olympic goal|score directly from a corner kick]], though this is uncommon. An [[own goal]] may not be scored directly: in the extremely unlikely event of the ball going directly into the attacking team's own goal from a corner kick, a corner kick would be awarded to the opposing side.
* An attacking player who directly receives the ball from a corner kick cannot be penalised for [[Offside (association football)|offside]].

===Infringements===

If the kick is taken with a moving ball, or from the wrong place, the corner kick is retaken.<ref name="sanctions">{{cite web |url=http://www.theifab.com/laws/chapter/37/section/111/ |title=Laws of the Game: Law 17: Corner Kick: Offences and Sanctions |date=2019 |access-date=22 September 2019 }}</ref>

Opposing players must retire the required distance as stated above. Failure to do so promptly may constitute [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|misconduct]] and be punished by a [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)#Yellow card (caution)|yellow card]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theifab.com/laws/chapter/32/section/94/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210203103953/https://theifab.com/laws/chapter/32/section/94/ |url-status=live |archive-date=3 February 2021 |title=Laws of the Game: Law 12: Fouls and Misconduct: Disciplinary Action |date=2019 |access-date=22 September 2019 }}</ref>

A player who excessively delays the restart of play is cautioned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/793/103202_200519_LotG_201920_EN_SinglePage.pdf|publisher=IFAB |title=Laws of the Game 2019/20 |access-date=2020-02-09 |page=110 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603034707/http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/793/103202_200519_LotG_201920_EN_SinglePage.pdf |archive-date=2019-06-03 |url-status=live }}</ref>

It is an offence for the kicker to touch the ball a second time before it has been touched by another player; this is punishable by an [[indirect free kick]] to the defending team from where the offence occurred,<ref>{{cite web |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008220449/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/footballdevelopment/technicalsupport/refereeing/laws-of-the-game/law/newsid=1290878.html |url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/footballdevelopment/technicalsupport/refereeing/laws-of-the-game/law/newsid=1290878.html |title=Law 17 - The corner kick |work=Laws of the Game |publisher=FIFA |archive-date=2012-10-08}}</ref> unless the second touch was also a more serious handling offence, in which case a [[direct free kick]] is awarded to the defending team.<ref name="sanctions"/>

===Tactics in taking and defending a corner===
[[File:Chelsea 1 lLiverpool 0 (2-1 agg) Capital One Cup semi final 2nd leg On our way to Wembley! (15768333164).jpg|thumb|[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (red) players prepare to defend a [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] (blue) corner.]]
[[File:На матче Бельгия - Англия 14 июля 2018 года.jpg|thumb|[[Eden Hazard]] of [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] (left, yellow) has the option to play a short corner against [[England national football team|England]] (red) at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].]]
A common tactic is for several attackers to stand close in front of the goal, whereupon the corner taker [[Cross (football)|crosses]] the ball for them to [[Association football|head]] into the goal.

The defending team may choose to form a wall of players in an attempt to force the ball to be played to an area which is more easily defended. However, this is not done often because defending players must remain at least 10 yards from the ball until it is in play.

The defending team also has the choice of whether to instruct a player to adopt a position beside one or both of the goalposts to provide protection to the goal in addition to the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. The thinking behind placing a player beside a goalpost is that it means more of the goal area is protected and there is no loss in the ability to play an [[Offside (association football)|offside trap]] because offside does not apply for the first touch from a corner, and it compensates for a keeper's positioning and/or reach.

The defending team also has to decide how many players it needs to defend a corner. Teams may withdraw every player into a defensive area, however this diminishes the potential for a counter-attack if possession is regained, and as such, allows the attacking side to commit more players to attacking the goal. Withdrawing all players into a defensive area also means that if the ball is cleared from an initial cross, it is more than likely that the attacking team will regain possession of the ball and begin a new attack.

In situations where a set-piece, such as a corner, is awarded to a side trailing by a single goal at the closing stages of a match where conceding further is of minimal consequence (i.e. in a knockout tournament) a team may commit all their players, [[Goalkeeper (association football)#Playmaking and attack|including their goalkeeper]], to the attack.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

====Man versus zonal marking====
Two popular strategies used for defending corners are called [[man marking]] and [[zonal marking]]. Man marking involves each defensive player at a corner being given an attacking player to defend, with their objective being to stop the attacking player from heading the ball. The other tactic, zonal marking, involves allocating each player to an area of the box to defend (their "zone"). The objective for players in zonal marking is to get to the ball first if it enters their zone and head it away from danger before an attacking player can reach it.

====Alternate tactics====
Rather than the kicker attempting a cross, an alternative strategy for the attacking team is the ''short corner''. The ball is passed to a player close the kicker, to create a better angle of approach toward the goal.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}

Teams attempting to [[running out the clock|time-waste]] may keep the ball in the corner of the pitch for as long as possible rather than attempt an attack.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}

[[File:Gololimpicodeonzari.jpg|thumb|[[Cesáreo Onzari]] scores a goal for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] at [[Estadio Sportivo Barracas]]. This was the first goal scored direct from a corner kick, in 1924.]]

It is possible to score with a corner kick if sufficient [[Magnus effect|swerve]] is given to the kick and/or if wind is blowing toward the goal. The goalkeeper is usually considered at fault if a goal is scored from a corner.<ref name="Freddi">{{cite web |last=Freddi |first=Cris |date=March 2003 |title=Gol olimpico |url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/2569/29/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124113814/http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/2569/29 |archive-date=24 November 2009 |access-date=17 November 2009 |work=[[When Saturday Comes]]}}</ref>

This type of goal is called an ''Olympic goal'' or ''Olimpico goal.'' On 14 June 1924, the IFAB formally legalized scoring in this manner; the first such goal was scored on 2 October 1924 by [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]'s [[Cesáreo Onzari]] against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], who had just won the [[Football at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympic title]].<ref name="fifa2015" /><ref name="Barnade" /><ref name="Freddi" />

For decades, English speakers generally used the term ''Olympic goal.'' But the 21st century has seen the rise in the use of ''Olimpico goal'', derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] term ''gol olímpico'' widely used in [[Latin America]].<ref name="fifa2015" /><ref name="Barnade" /> [[Max Bretos]] has used it on [[Fox Soccer Channel]] in the United States, reflecting Latino influence on [[Soccer in the United States|the sport's culture there]]. Virtually all reports of [[Megan Rapinoe]]'s goal for the [[USWNT|United States]] in the [[bronze medal]] match at the [[2020 Tokyo Olympics]] referred to it as an ''Olimpico goal''.<ref name="Westwood" />

===Notable examples===
* Although FIFA states the first goal from a corner was scored by [[Billy Alston]] in Scotland on 21 August 1924,<ref name="fifa2015"/><ref name="Barnade"/> in fact, Alston's goal was from a header two days later on 23 August 1924, when Alston scored for [[St Bernard's F.C.]] in a [[1924–25 Scottish Division Two|Scottish Second Division]] match against [[Albion Rovers F.C.]]<ref name="Barnade"/> 
* [[Dejan Petković]] scored eight Olimpico goals in his career.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mctear |first=Euan |title=Dejan Petković: The unlikely hero of both the Marakana and the Maracanã |url=https://thesefootballtimes.co/2019/09/26/dejan-petkovic-the-unlikely-hero-of-both-the-marakana-and-the-maracana/ |date=26 September 2019 |publisher=[[These Football Times]] |access-date=23 November 2025 |lang=en}}</ref>

==History==

===Background===
[[File:Thomas Hemy Sunderland v Aston Villa 1895 A Corner Kick.jpg|thumb|1895 painting, "A Corner Kick", by Thomas M.M. Hemy, depicting an 1895 match between [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]]]
[[File:Oxford Takes a Corner (1905).png|thumb|A corner-kick in the annual [[Oxford University A.F.C.|Oxford]] v [[Cambridge University A.F.C.|Cambridge]] match (photograph published 1905)]]
Under the original 1863 rules of the Football Association, a ball kicked behind the goal-line was treated similarly to present-day rugby: if an attacking player touched the ball down first, the attacking team was awarded a free-kick at goal (similar to a conversion in rugby), while if a defending player touched the ball down first, the defending team was awarded a goal-kick.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1863) |quote=In case the ball goes behind the goal line, if a player on the side to whom the goal belongs first touches the ball, one of his side shall be entitled to a free kick from the goal line at the point opposite the place where the ball shall be touched. If a player of the opposite side first touches the ball, one of his side shall be entitled to a free kick (but at the goal only) from a point 15 yards from the goal line opposite the place where the ball is touched. The opposing side shall stand behind their goal line until he has had his kick.}}</ref> These rules were subsequently simplified, so that by 1867 a goal-kick was awarded in all circumstances, regardless of which team touched the ball.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1867) |quote=When the ball is kicked behind the goal line, it must be kicked off by the side behind whose goal it went, within six yards from the limit of their goal.}}</ref>

During this period, clubs around Sheffield played their [[Sheffield rules|own distinctive code of football]]. The laws promulgated in early March 1867 by the newly formed [[Sheffield Football Association]] contained a similar rule: a goal-kick was awarded whenever the ball went behind the goal-line, regardless of which team touched the ball.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Sheffield Rules (March 1867) |quote=When the ball is kicked behind the goal line or over the bars of the goal or rouge flags, it must be kicked off by the side behind whose goal it went, within six yards from the limit of their goal.}}</ref>
One problem with these early rules was mentioned at the 1867 FA meeting:<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Bell's Life in London |title=The Football Association |date=1867-03-02 |page=9 |issue=2341 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Football_Association_(Bell%27s_Life_in_London)_1867-03-02.png}}</ref> {{blockquote|Where one side was very much weaker than the other, a very great deal of time was wasted by players intentionally letting the ball go behind their own goal-line (in some instances kicking it there themselves) particularly in playing against time.}}

===Introduction in Sheffield rules===
An early law providing for a ''throw-in'' from the corner flag had already been used by the Sheffield Mechanics' Football Club for the 1865–66 season:<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rules in 1866 |journal=Nottingham Evening Post |date=22 February 1935 |page=14}}</ref>{{blockquote|When the ball is in touch, the side that first touches it must bring it to the edge of the touch at the place where it went in, and throw it straight out at least six yards, and it must touch the ground before coming in contact with any player, ''except it be kicked out at the goal-sides, then it must be taken to the corner-flag and thrown in''.}}

The corner-kick itself was suggested in a letter to the editor of the ''[[Sheffield Daily Telegraph]]'' published on 22 March 1867.<ref name="rouge"/> The author, writing under the [[pseudonym]] "Rouge", argued that the then-current rule was "a great inducement to foul and dishonourable play, for it is manifestly to the advantage of a defending side to allow the ball to pass their goal line, they having the great advantage or a free kick-off". Instead, Rouge suggested, "when the ball is kicked behind the goal-line, the players [should] run for touch, and the side winning the touch, kicks in from the nearest corner-flag".<ref name="rouge">{{cite journal |author=Rouge |title=To the editor of the Sheffield Daily Telegraph |journal=Sheffield Daily Telegraph |date=22 March 1867 |page=4 |issue=3680 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Letter_to_the_editor_(Sheffield_Daily_Telegraph)_1867-03-22.png}}</ref>

The corner-kick was introduced to Sheffield football the following year, as the result of a rule-change proposed by [[Norfolk F.C.]] The law, adopted in October 1868, ran:<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Sheffield Rules (1868)}}</ref> {{blockquote|When the ball is kicked over the bar of the goal, it must be kicked-off by the side behind whose goal it went, within six yards from the limit of their goal. The side who thus kick the ball are entitled to a fair kick-off in whatever way they please; the opposite side not being allowed to approach within six yards of the ball. When the ball is kicked behind the goal line, a player of the opposite side to that which kicked it out, shall kick it in from the nearest corner-flag; no player to be allowed within six yards of the ball until kicked.}}
This Sheffield form of the corner-kick had two significant differences from today's version:
* The corner-kick could be awarded to either the attacking or the defending team, depending on which team kicked the ball behind the goal-line.
* When the ball was kicked ''directly over the crossbar'', by either team, a goal-kick was awarded to the defending team.
The Sheffield clubs would retain this form of the corner-kick rule until they adopted the FA's rules wholesale in 1877.

===Introduction in association football===
In 1872, the Sheffield Association successfully introduced the corner-kick into the Football Association's code. The new FA rule was identical to the Sheffield rule, as described above.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1872) |quote=When the ball is kicked over the bar of the goal, it must be kicked off by the side behind whose goal it went, within six yards from the limit of their goal. The side who thus kick the ball are entitled to a fair kick off in whatever way they please; the opposite side not being allowed to approach within six yards of the ball. When the ball is kicked behind the goal line, a player of the opposite side to that which kicked it out shall kick it from the nearest corner flag. No player to be allowed within six yards of the ball until kicked.}}</ref>

===1873 changes===
The next year, 1873, the FA rule was rewritten, under a proposal by [[Marlow F.C.|Great Marlow FC]], to essentially its current form:<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1873) |year=1873}}</ref>
* When the attacking team kicked the ball behind the goal-line, a goal-kick was awarded to the defending team
* When the defending team kicked the ball behind the goal-line, a corner-kick was awarded to the attacking team.
The FA rule of 1873 stated: {{blockquote|When the ball is kicked behind the goal-line by one of the opposite side, it shall be kicked off by any one of the players behind whose goal line it went, within six yards of the nearest goal post; but if kicked behind by any one of the side whose goal line it is, a player of the opposite side shall kick it from the nearest corner flag-post. In either case no other player shall be allowed within six yards of the ball until kicked off.}}

===Subsequent developments===

====Name====
The name "corner-kick" first appears in the laws of 1883.<ref name="laws_1883"/> Before this, the phrase "corner-flag kick" was used (1875).
<ref name="laws_1875"/>

====Position of the kick====
In 1874, the kick was allowed to be taken from within one yard of the corner-flag, rather than from the flag itself.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1874) |quote=When the ball is kicked behind the goal-line by one of the opposite side, it shall be kicked off by any one of the players behind whose goal line it went, within six yards of the nearest goal post; but if kicked behind by any one of the side whose goal line it is, a player of the opposite side shall kick it from within one yard of the nearest corner flag-post. In either case no other player shall be allowed within six yards of the ball until kicked off.}}</ref>

====Position of other players====
Initially, all other players were forbidden to be within six yards of the ball at a corner-kick; this was altered to all ''opposing'' players in 1888.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1888) |quote=When the ball is played behind the goal-line by one of the opposite side, it shall be kicked off by any one of the players behind whose goal line it went within six yards of the nearest goal-post; but if played behind by any one of the side whose goal-line it is, a player of the opposite side shall kick it from within one yard of the nearest corner flag-post. '''In either case no opponent shall be allowed within six yards of the ball until it is kicked off.'''}}</ref> In 1913 and 1914, the distance was increased from six yards to ten yards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1913min.pdf|title=International Football Association Board: 1913 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1914min.pdf|title=International Football Association Board: 1914 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting}}</ref><ref name="laws_1913_14">The [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(1913) Laws of 1913] are ambiguous: Law 7, which governs goal-kicks and corner-kicks, states "an opponent shall not be allowed within six yards of the ball until it is kicked off"; but Law 10, which governs several types of set-piece kicks, was changed to state that "the kicker's opponents shall not approach within '''10''' yards of the ball until the kick is taken". The Football Association used the new 10-yard rule for goal-kicks and corner-kicks during the 1913-14 season, while the Scottish Football Association used the older 6-yard rule -- see {{cite journal |journal=The Athletic News and Cyclists' Journal |page=1 |date=6 October 1913 |title=The New Free Kick Law |issue=1984}} This ambiguity was resolved in [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(1914) 1914] by requiring a 10-yard radius in both laws.</ref> In 2006, the minimum distance was specified as ten yards ''from the corner area'', rather than from the ball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ssbra.org/lib/2006_IFAB_Agenda.pdf |title=Agenda of the 120th Annual General Meeting of the International Football Association Board |page=13 |access-date=13 January 2020 |year=2006}}</ref>

====Putting the ball into play====
In 1905, it was specified that the ball "must make a complete circuit or travel the distance of its circumference" before being in play.<ref name="laws_1905">{{cite wikisource |Laws of the Game (1905) |quote=When a free kick has been awarded, the kicker's opponents shall not approach within 6 yards of the ball unless they are standing on their own goal-line. '''The ball must at least be rolled over before it shall be considered played; i.e., it must make a complete circuit or travel the distance of its circumference'''. The kicker shall not play the ball a second time until it has been played by another player. The kick-off (except as provided by Law 2), '''corner-kick''', and goal-kick, shall be free kicks within the meaning of this Law. [emphasis added] }}</ref> In 1997, this requirement was eliminated: the ball became in play as soon as it was kicked and moved.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1997min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1997 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |page=140 |access-date=3 December 2019 }}</ref> In 2016, it was specified that the ball must "clearly" move.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/assets/documents/IFAB_laws_of_the_game_changes.pdf |page=48 |title=IFAB: Law Changes 2016-17 |access-date=3 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615041349/http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/assets/documents/IFAB_laws_of_the_game_changes.pdf |archive-date=15 June 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Offside from a corner-kick====
When first introduced in 1872, the corner-kick was required to be taken from the corner-flag itself, which made it impossible for an attacking player to be in an offside position directly from a corner. In 1874, the kick was allowed to be taken up to one yard from the corner-flag, thus opening up the possibility of a player being in an offside position by being ahead of the ball. At the [[International Football Conference]] of December 1882, it was agreed that a player should not be offside from a corner-kick; this change was incorporated into the Laws of the Game in 1883.<ref name="laws_1883">{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1883) |quote=When a player kicks the ball, or throws it in from touch, any one of the same side who, at such moment of kicking or throwing, is nearer to the opponents' goal-line is out of play, and may not touch the ball himself, nor in any way whatever prevent any other player from doing so until the ball has been played, unless there are at such moment of kicking or throwing at least three of his opponents nearer their own goal line; '''but no player is out of play in the case of a corner-kick''' or when the ball is kicked from the goal line, or when it has been last played by an opponent.}}</ref>

====Scoring a goal from a corner-kick====

When it was first introduced in 1872, there was no restriction on [[#Olympic goal|scoring a goal directly from a corner-kick]]. In 1875, this was forbidden,<ref name="laws_1875"/> but it was subsequently legalised by the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB) meeting of 14 June 1924 with effect from for the following season, and is now referred to as an ''Olimpico goal''.<ref name="fifa2015">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/news/y=2011/m=11/news=getting-grips-with-the-gol-olimpico-1537608.html|title=Getting to grips with the 'gol olímpico'|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813034801/https://www.fifa.com/news/y=2011/m=11/news=getting-grips-with-the-gol-olimpico-1537608.html |archive-date=13 August 2015| date=2 January 2015|work=Off the ball|publisher=[[FIFA]]|access-date=16 August 2017}}</ref><ref name="Barnade">{{cite web |url=http://www.clarin.com/deportes/fundador-gol-olimpico_0_1066093752.html|title=El gol olímpico cumple 80 |last=Barnade |first=Oscar |date=October 2004 |work=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] |language=es |access-date=17 November 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1924/1924min.pdf |title=Minutes of the AGM of the IFAB |date=14 June 1924 |publisher=SSBRA |page=3 |access-date=29 November 2009 |location=London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616011341/http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1924/1924min.pdf |archive-date=16 June 2011 }}</ref> In 1997, the laws were amended to remove the possibility of scoring an [[own goal]] directly from a corner kick.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1997min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1997 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |page=140 |access-date=8 October 2018}}</ref>

====Touching the ball twice from a corner-kick====

When initially introduced in 1872, there was no restriction on [[dribbling]] from a corner-kick. In 1875, this was changed: it was forbidden for a player to touch the ball again after taking a corner-kick, before the ball had been touched by another player.<ref name="laws_1875">{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1875) |quote=In no case shall a goal be scored from any free kick, nor shall the ball be again played by the kicker until it has been played by another player. The kick-off and corner-flag kick shall be free kicks within the meaning of this rule}}</ref>

In 1924, this restriction was accidentally removed, as an unintended consequence of the law-change allowing a goal to be scored directly from a corner.<ref name="minutes_1924">{{cite web|url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1924min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1924 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |access-date=16 October 2018 |page=4}}</ref> This possibility was exploited by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] winger [[Sam Chedgzoy]] in a match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 15 November of that year.<ref>{{cite journal |page=2 |title=That Corner Kick Rule |journal=The Daily Mail |location=Hull |date=19 November 1924 |issue=12209}}</ref> At the end of November, the International Football Association Board issued emergency instructions that dribbling was once again forbidden.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Corner Kick Ruling |page=2 |journal=Western Morning News |date=29 November 1924 |issue=20189 |location=Plymouth}}</ref> The law was formally amended to prohibit dribbling at the next annual meeting of the Board, in 1925.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Off-Side Change Carried |page=8 |journal=Berwickshire News |date=23 June 1925 |location=Duns}}</ref><ref name="minutes_1925">{{cite web|url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1925min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1925 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |access-date=16 October 2018 |page=4}}</ref>

====Punishment for infringement====
In 1882, an indirect free-kick was awarded when the player taking the corner-kick touched the ball again before it had touched another player.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1882) |quote=11. In the event of any infringement of Rules 5, 6, 8, or 9, '''12''', or 14, a free kick shall be forfeited to the opposite side from the spot where the infringement took place.<br />12. In no case shall a goal be scored from any free kick, '''nor shall the ball be again played by the kicker until it has been played by another player. The kick-off and corner-flag kick shall be free kicks within the meaning of this rule''' [emphasis added]. }}</ref>

In 1905, an indirect free-kick was awarded for any infringement at a corner-kick.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1905) |quote=[Law 10]: When a free kick has been awarded, the kicker's opponents shall not approach within 6 yards of the ball unless they are standing on their own goal-line. The ball must at least be rolled over before it shall be considered played; i.e., it must make a complete circuit or travel the distance of its circumference. The kicker shall not play the ball a second time until it has been played by another player. The kick-off (except as provided by Law 2), '''corner-kick''', and goal-kick, shall be free kicks within the meaning of this Law.<br /> [Law 17]: In the event of any infringement of Laws 5, 6, 8, '''10''', or 16, a free kick shall be awarded to the opposite side, [emphasis added]}}</ref>

These penalties were accidentally removed from the laws in 1924, as described above. In 1930, both penalties were reinstated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1930min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1930 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |at=p. 2 [p. 3 of PDF] |access-date=27 December 2019 |quote=LAW 10 (last sentence) Re-insert the words 'corner kick'}}</ref> In 1973, the remedy for infringements other than the double touch was changed to a retake.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1973min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1973 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |at=p. 13 [p. 14 of PDF] |quote=For any other infringement the kick shall be retaken |access-date=27 December 2019 }}</ref>

====Pitch markings====

The one-yard quarter-circle pitch marking is first explicitly mentioned in the Laws of the Game in 1938, but appears in the diagram of the pitch as early as 1902.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1900-39/1902-03/IFAB1902.html|title=International Football Association Board meeting 1902|website=www.englandfootballonline.com}}</ref> In 1995, the Laws of the Game were updated to explicitly allow optional marks on the goal line 11 yards from the corner flag, at right angles to the goal-line, to aid the referee in enforcing the minimum distance from the corner kick.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1995min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1995 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |at=p. 6 [p. 8 of the PDF] |access-date=13 January 2020 }}</ref> In 2008, similar optional marks were permitted at right angles to the touch lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/federation/81/42/36/lotg_en.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206073655/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/federation/81/42/36/lotg%5fen.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 December 2008 |title=Laws of the Game 2008/2009 |at=p. 6 [p. 8 of the PDF] |access-date=13 January 2020 }}</ref>  (In 1977, the Scottish FA had proposed an additional pitch-marking of a quarter-circle with a radius of 11 yards for this purpose, but the suggestion was rejected).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1977min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1977 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |at=p. 2 [p. 4 of the PDF] |access-date=13 January 2020 }}</ref>

====Use as a tiebreaker====
In the early 1920s, some charity matches began using corner-kicks as a tie-breaker in order to avoid replays.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Athletic News |date=1923-04-02 |page=1 |title=En Passant |quote=This change is not quite so unnecessary as it might appear, for matches have been decided by corner-kicks to prevent replays in charity games late in the season.}}</ref>  In response, the laws of the game were amended in 1923 to state explicitly that the goal was the only means of scoring, and that a match that ended with equal number of goals scored was drawn.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1923)|quote=A game shall be won by the team scoring the greater number of goals. If no goals have been scored, or the scores are equal at the end of the game, the game shall be drawn|sign=|source=}}</ref>
Despite this, the [[Dublin City Cup]] (until the 1960s) and [[Dublin and Belfast Inter-City Cup]] (in the 1940s) used corner count as a tiebreaker in knockout rounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bohemianfc.com/?p=9377|title=The 1945 Inter-City Cup: War, Goals, Controversy and death by corner kicks|last=Farrell|first=Gerard|date=1 October 2015|publisher=[[Bohemian FC]]|access-date=16 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablesi/ierdublincityhist.html|title=Ireland - Dublin City Cup Winners|first=Sean |last=DeLoughry|date=28 May 2015|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]|access-date=16 August 2017}}</ref> The use of corner-kicks in this manner was never approved by the [[International Football Association Board]], and in 1970 IFAB endorsed the [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] as its approved method of breaking ties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1970min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1970 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |page=6 |access-date=24 January 2019 }}</ref>
