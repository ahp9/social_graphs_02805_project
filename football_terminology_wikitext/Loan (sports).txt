In sports, a '''loan''' involves a particular player being able to temporarily play for a club other than the one to which they are currently contracted. Loan deals may last from a few weeks to a full season, sometimes persisting for multiple seasons at a time. A loan fee can be arranged by the parent club as well as them asking to pay a percentage of their wages.

==Association football==
Players may be loaned out to other clubs for several reasons. Most commonly, young [[Prospect (sports)|prospects]] will be loaned to a club in a lower league in order to gain invaluable [[first team (association football)|first team]] experience. In this instance, the parent club may continue to pay the player's wages in full or in part. Some clubs put a formal arrangement in place with a [[Farm team|feeder club]] for this purpose, such as [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Royal Antwerp FC|Royal Antwerp]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/antwerp-connection-is-a-belgium-delight-for-manchester-united |title= Antwerp connection is a Belgium delight for Manchester United |last= Mitten |first= Andy |date= 9 March 2012 |website= thenational.ae |publisher= [[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |access-date= 22 December 2014}}</ref> [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[K.S.K.

A club may take a player on loan if they are short on transfer funds but can still pay wages, or as temporary cover for injuries or suspensions. The parent club might demand a fee or that the loaning club pays some or all of the player's wages during the loan period.<ref>{{cite web

A loan may be made to get around a [[transfer window]]. Such a loan might include an agreed fee for a permanent transfer when the next transfer window opens. Some players are loaned because they are unhappy or in dispute with their current club and no other club wishes to buy them permanently.

In the [[Premier League]], players on loan are not permitted to play against the team which holds their registration (section 7.2 of rule M.6). Loanees are, however, allowed to play against their 'owning' clubs in cup competitions should they get permission, unless they are [[cup-tied]] (i.e. have played for their owning club in that cup during that season).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-11-21 |title=Football loan transfer rules: Premier League guidelines, limits & full details  |url=https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/football-loan-transfer-rules-premier-league-guidelines-limits--full-details/1kbkbnfluqauo1jpdowcm1pimp |access-date=2024-01-20 |website=Goal.com US |language=en-US |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240204100242/https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/football-loan-transfer-rules-premier-league-guidelines-limits--full-details/1kbkbnfluqauo1jpdowcm1pimp |archive-date= Feb 4, 2024 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-01-31 |title=Football loan transfer rules: Premier League guidelines, limits & full details |url=https://www.90min.com/posts/football-loan-transfer-rules-premier-league-guidelines-limits-full-details |access-date=2024-01-20 |website=90min |first1=James |last1=Cormack |language=en-GB |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230602143304/https://www.90min.com/posts/football-loan-transfer-rules-premier-league-guidelines-limits-full-details |archive-date= Jun 2, 2023 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cunningham |first=Jack |date=2023-09-27 |title=Can David Raya play against Brentford?

===Unpaid trialists===
In the [[Scottish Professional Football League]] (and previously the [[Scottish Football League]]), clubs are permitted to take players on as unpaid trialists even for competitive fixtures. Sometimes for the first two weeks of a trial period player' names are obfuscated; match reports use the convention "A Trialist" to refer to such players in lieu of using their real names.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.spfl.co.uk/docs/067_324__therulesofthespfl_1375800603.pdf |title=The Rules of the Scottish Professional Football League |page=112 |website=Scottish Professional Football League |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611130607/http://spfl.co.uk/docs/067_324__therulesofthespfl_1375800603.pdf |archive-date= Jun 11, 2014 }}</ref>

==Rugby league==
Player loans occur in [[rugby league]] for similar reasons to soccer.  In the United Kingdom, the [[Rugby Football League]] (RFL) stipulate that loans must last for at least 28 days.<ref>{{cite book |title=Tiers 1–3 Operational Rules 2020 |date=2020 |publisher=RFL |url=https://secure.rugby-league.com/ign_docs/143535%20RFL%20Operational%20Rules%20Tier%201-3%202020%20Web.pdf |chapter=C1.2}}</ref> There is no bar against a player playing for the loan club against the parent club unless this has been specified in the loan agreement.  In Australia the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) does not normally allow loans due to the [[National Rugby League reserves affiliations|feeder club arrangement]] but the COVID-19 pandemic forced a review of the situation and in 2020 loans were allowed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Warriors get NRL OK to loan players – Australian Associated Press |url=https://www.aap.com.au/warriors-get-nrl-ok-to-loan-players/ |publisher=Australian Associated Press |access-date=24 September 2020 |language=en |date=23 May 2020}}</ref>

===Guest appearances===
In the [[First World War]] the RFL relaxed player registration rules to allow players to play for clubs close to their military base or workplace. Confusion could arise; in 1917 [[Billy Batten]] was working near to Dewsbury so [[Dewsbury Rams|Dewsbury]] selected him to play against his registered club, [[Hull FC]]. Hull had also selected Batten to play in the same game. On this occasion, Batten chose to play for Dewsbury.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Collins |first1=Tony |title=Rugby League in World War One |url=http://www.tony-collins.org/rugbyreloaded/2014/8/5/rugby-league-in-world-war-one |website=Rugby Reloaded |access-date=24 September 2020 |date=5 August 2014}}</ref> During the [[Second World War]] the RFL allowed players to play as guests for another club on a match by match basis as long as the owning club agreed to the appearance.  The system also allowed players whose club had suspended operations to play while still being registered to the original club<ref>{{cite book |last1=Collins |first1=Tony |title=Rugby League in Twentieth Century Britain |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-39615-8 |page=77}}</ref> Clubs made full use of the guest system; in the [[1940–41 Northern Rugby Football League Wartime Emergency League season#Championship play-off|1940–41 Championship final]] between [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] and [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford]], Wigan featured guest players from [[Liverpool Stanley]], [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]] and [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] while Bradford included guests from Salford and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Saxton |editor1-first=Irvin |title=History of Rugby League: No.46: 1940–41 |publisher=Rugby Leaguer |date=1985 |page=23 }}</ref>

==Ice hockey==
{{see also|Ice hockey contract}}
The [[International Ice Hockey Federation]]'s International Transfer Regulations serve as guidelines all player transfers, including loans, between [[List of members of the International Ice Hockey Federation|member national associations]] and their leagues. Loans between associations, where a player temporarily joins a club in another member association, are classified as limited transfers, meaning the player's playing rights are restricted to that association for a defined period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blob.iihf.com/iihf-media/iihfmvc/media/downloads/regulations/2025/2025_iihf_international_transfer_regulations_20241122.pdf|title=IIHF International Transfer Regulations|year=2025|access-date=10 June 2025|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation}}</ref>

===NHL===
The highest level of professional play for ice hockey is considered to be the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) of [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. As with other major [[North America]]n sports, the NHL is a [[closed league]] without [[promotion and relegation]] and utilizes a system of [[Minor league#Ice hockey|minor league]] [[farm team]]s to develop players. Loans in ice hockey, subsequently, tend to be either formalized short-term reassignments of NHL players to either a team's minor league affiliate or a longer-term reassignment to an unaffiliated club outside of North America, most commonly to a [[Sport in Europe#Ice hockey|European team]].

NHL teams are permitted to loan players to teams outside of North America. The terms of the loan, including the receiving team, duration of loan, and salary responsibility to the player, are determined on case-by-case basis for each individual.<ref name=NHLCBA2013/>

====Conditioning loan====
An NHL team is permitted to temporarily loan a player to their [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate team without having to place the player on [[Waivers (NHL)|waivers]], which may be normally be required to send the player to them on a more permanent basis; this is usually done with a player coming off an injury. Additionally, a player on a conditional loan is paid their NHL salary rate (rather than the lower rate paid if permanently assigned to a minor league club), the player counts towards the NHL roster limits and their team's [[NHL salary cap|salary cap]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pensionplanpuppets.com/understanding-conditioning-stints-toronto-maple-leafs-roster-loopholes-that-arent/|title=Understanding Conditioning Stints|first=Cathy|last=Squires|date=February 16, 2021|website=PPP Leafs}}</ref><ref name=NHLCBA2013>{{cite web|url=https://cdn.nhlpa.com/img/assets/file/NHL_NHLPA_2013_CBA.pdf|date=September 15, 2012|title=2013 NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement|publisher=NHL Players' Association}}</ref><ref name=NHLMOU2020>{{cite web|url=https://cdn.nhlpa.com/img/assets/file/NHLPA_NHL_MOU.pdf|date=July 10, 2020|title=2020 NHL Memorandum of Understanding|publisher=NHL Players' Association}}</ref> AHL teams are allowed to loan players down to the [[ECHL|East Coast Hockey League]] (ECHL).<ref name=NHLCBA2013/>

====Tryouts====
NHL teams and their affiliates are also allowed to temporarily receive [[Amateur sports|amateur]] players to evaluate them while they are still members of other teams, usually either a [[junior ice hockey]] or [[college ice hockey]] teams. These players sign temporary Amateur Tryout (ATO) contracts that allow them to play for an NHL, AHL, or ECHL team without pay (as to not jeopardize their amateur status), though the rules vary on their usage. The NHL primarily uses ATOs for its [[EBUG|emergency back–up goaltender]] (EBUG) rule and only last for a single game.<ref name=NHLCBA2013/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/31/sports/hockey/31backups.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 31, 2010|title=Emergency Backups to the Stars|first=Matt|last=Caputo}}</ref> The AHL and ECHL allow for longer term tryouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thepinkpuck.com/2014/01/09/ato-pto-what-a-primer-on-hockey-contracts/|publisher=The Pink Puck|first=Tasha|last=Hudick|date=January 9, 2014|title=ATO, PTO What?
