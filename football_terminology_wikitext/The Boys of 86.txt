The West Ham team from this season achieved their highest ever position in the [[Football League]], third in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. They were challenging for the title throughout the season which has been described as West Ham's greatest ever season. With one game remaining they were second in the league eventually finishing third behind champions, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/417 | title=Champions | publisher=www.lfchistory.net | accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref> and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].<ref name="McDonaldFrancis2005">{{cite book|author1=Tony McDonald|author2=Danny Francis|title=Boys of '86: The Untold Story of West Ham United's Greatest-Ever Season|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OwhBAQAACAAJ|date=1 July 2005|publisher=Mainstream Publishing Company, Limited|isbn=978-1-84018-864-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&ham=1986&united=1st_Division_1985-86 | title=1st Division 1986-86 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/west-ham-united/1985-1986/results | title=West Ham United results 1985-86 | publisher=www.statto.com | accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref>

Managed by [[John Lyall]], West Ham had finished 16th in the previous season but additions of [[Frank McAvennie]] and [[Mark Ward (footballer, born 1962)|Mark Ward]]<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/mark-ward-from-no-7-to-prisoner-number-nm6982-515481.html | title=Mark Ward: From No 7 to prisoner number NM6982 | newspaper=The Independent | date=16 November 2005 | accessdate=4 December 2021}}</ref> combined with the partnership of McAvennie and [[Tony Cottee]] and the captaincy of [[Alvin Martin]]<ref name=dvd/> made West Ham genuine title challengers.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/nov/27/scott-murray-85-86-football-season | title=The forgotten story of ... the 1985-86 First Division season | work=The Guardian | date=27 November 2008 | accessdate=7 April 2015 | last1=Murray | first1=Scott }}</ref>

The season had started badly with one win from the first seven games. By the autumn the club had gone on a record 18 games undefeated including nine successive victories and by Christmas of 1985 they were described by journalist [[Joe Melling]] of the ''[[Daily Express]]'' as the "best team in the land". After three defeats in four games and a period when fixtures were badly affected by weather West Ham were 7th. However a 4–0 away win at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'s [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130314/six-of-the-best-chelsea_2236884_3108100 | title=Six of the best&nbsp;— Chelsea | publisher=www.whufc.com | accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref> an 8–1 win against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], in which Alvin Martin scored a hat-trick against three different goalkeepers,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3485602.stm | title=The hat-trick hall of fame | date=25 February 2004 | publisher=BBC Sport | access-date=9 April 2015}}</ref> and a period when four games were played in one week, had West Ham four points behind Liverpool with a game in hand. The title was eventually won by Liverpool after [[Kenny Dalglish]] scored in a 1–0 victory over Chelsea in the last but one game of the season.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/results/1986-05-03 | title=All of the results on Saturday 3rd May 1986 | publisher=www.statto.com | accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref> In a final game of the season an exhausted West Ham team lost to Everton at [[Goodison Park]] to take third place.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/results/1986-05-05/everton-v-west-ham-united | title=Everton v West Ham United on 5th May 1986 | publisher=www.statto.com | accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref>

Team member [[Tony Gale]], who would later go on to win a [[Premier League]] title with [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], said of the season, "I will never forget those days as long as I live. That was a dream team....wonderful to play in and wonderful to watch".<ref name="SharrattBlows2011">{{cite book|author1=Ben Sharratt|author2=Kirk Blows|title=Bring Me the Head of Trevor Brooking: Three Decades of East End Soap Opera at West Ham United|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bfcqUhJOOMC&pg=PT49|date=1 April 2011|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|isbn=978-1-84596-901-1|pages=49–}}</ref> McAvennie scored 26 league goals in the season with Cottee contributing 20.
