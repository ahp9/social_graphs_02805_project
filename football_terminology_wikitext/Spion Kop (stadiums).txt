'''Spion Kop''' (or the '''Kop''' for short) is a colloquial name or term for a number of single-tier [[terrace (stadium)|terraces]] and stands at [[list of sports|sports]] [[stadium]]s, particularly in the [[United Kingdom]]. The steep nature resembles the [[Spion Kop (mountain)|Spion Kop]], a hill near [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]], South Africa, which was the scene of the [[Battle of Spion Kop]] in January 1900 during the [[Second Boer War]].

The first recorded reference to a sports terrace as "Kop" related to [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]]'s [[Manor Ground (Plumstead)|Manor Ground]] in 1904, four years after the Second Boer War.<ref name="TGAM">{{cite web |date=25 June 2010 |title=Showdown in Durban |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/soccer/the-worlds-game/showdown-in-durban/article1617646/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304215309/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/soccer/the-worlds-game/showdown-in-durban/article1617646/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |access-date=5 October 2023 |website=The Globe And Mail |publisher=}}</ref><ref name=irwin /> A local newsman likened the silhouette of fans standing on a newly raised bank of earth to soldiers standing atop the [[Spion Kop (mountain)|hill]] at the [[Battle of Spion Kop]]. Two years later in 1906, ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' sports editor [[Ernest Edwards (journalist)|Ernest Edwards]] noted of a new open-air embankment at [[Anfield]]: 
{{blockquote|This huge wall of earth has been termed "Spion Kop", and no doubt this apt name will always be used in future in referring to this spot.}}

The use of the name for the stand was given recognition at Anfield in 1928 when it was extended to a 27,000 capacity and a [[cantilever]] roof was added which amplified the roar of the crowd to create an intense atmosphere.<ref name=irwin /> Traditionally, Liverpool's most vocal supporters congregate in this stand and are referred to as ''kopites''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/football/10/29/first11.stadiums/ |title=Football First 11: Stunning stadiums |publisher=CNN |access-date=29 October 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210220621/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/football/10/29/first11.stadiums/ |archive-date=10 February 2009  }}</ref> Such is the reputation of the stand that it was claimed that the crowd in the Kop could suck the ball into the goal and it has become one of the most famous football stands in the world.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/8257477/Liverpool-2-Everton-2-match-report.html |title=Liverpool 2 Everton 2: match report |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=16 January 2011 |access-date=12 July 2011 |first=Jason |last=Burt}}</ref>

Liverpool's Spion Kop (capacity 27,000, although crowds of 30,000+ have been recorded) was redesigned in 1994 (completed) to comply with requirements of the [[Taylor Report]], which made all-seater stadiums obligatory in the highest two divisions of English football. A new Spion Kop was built in its place with 12,390 seats, making it the largest single-tier stand in the country at the time. This new Kop still stands and currently houses the club's museum.
 
Following the opening of the new [[Tottenham Hotspur Stadium]], Anfield's Kop ceased to be the largest single-tier stand in the country. The South Stand of the new stadium has 17,500 seats and has an incline of 34 degrees, making it one of the steepest stands in the country.<ref>{{Cite news|last=White|first=Jim|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/03/22/tottenham-hotspurs-new-home-sets-benchmark-modern-stadia/|title=Tottenham Hotspur's new home sets benchmark for modern stadia|date=2019-03-22|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2020-02-24|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

Manchester United's proposed new 100,000-capacity Old Trafford stadium will reportedly take inspiration from Tottenham's South Stand with a 'new Stretford End'<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kenmare|first=Jack|title=Sir Jim Ratcliffe's plans for a 'new Old Trafford' have emerged and they are seriously impressive|url=https://www.sportbible.com/football/football-news/man-utd/man-utd-sir-jim-ratcliffe-premier-league-485187-20240215|date=2024-02-15|work=Sport Bible|access-date=2024-11-26|language=en-GB}}</ref> to be a single-tier, steep stand which, due to the overall ground's significantly higher capacity, would likely house 25,000 supporters, indeed a stadium designed to the same proportions but with a 100,000 capacity would actually see this 'new Stretford End' holding as many as 29,000.

[[Villa Park]]'s old Holte End was historically the largest of all Kop ends, closely followed by the old South Bank at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]], both once regularly holding crowds in excess of 30,000.<ref name=irwin>{{cite book |title=Sing When You're Winning |first=Colin |last=Irwin |date=2006|publisher=Andre Deutsch|isbn=978-0233001845 |page=164}}</ref>

Many other English [[association football|football]] clubs and some [[rugby league]] clubs (such as [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]]'s former home [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]]) applied the same name to stands in later years.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

== Composition ==
There is much debate about what type of stand constitutes a Kop.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The size and location of the stand in the stadium varies; most are located behind the goal and are occupied by its club's most vocal supporters. It is usually a single-tiered stand and was traditionally terraced. In England, [[Taylor Report|safety regulations]] brought into effect after the 1989 [[Hillsborough disaster]] required many to be made [[All-seater stadium|all-seated]]. A Kop is not necessarily the largest stand in the stadium and does not have to have a particularly large capacity; for example, Chesterfield's former stadium, [[Saltergate]], had a Kop with a capacity of only a few thousand.
