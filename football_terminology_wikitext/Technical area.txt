The '''technical area''' in [[association football]] is the area at the side of the [[Association football pitch|pitch]] which the teams' [[manager (association football)|manager]]s, other coaching personnel, and [[substitute (football)|substitute]]s are allowed to occupy during a match.<ref name=FIFALaws/>

The technical area usually includes a seated area referred to as the "dugout" or "bench" as well as a marked zone in front of it and adjacent to the pitch.<ref name=FIFALaws/>

==History==
[[File:Old Trafford Technical Area Alex Ferguson Sam Allardyce.jpg|thumb|White lines define the limits of each team's technical area at [[Manchester United]]'s [[Old Trafford]] in 2009.]]
The first football stadium to feature a dugout was [[Pittodrie Stadium]], home of [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], where dugouts were introduced by trainer [[Donald Colman]] in the 1920s. He wanted a place to take notes and observe his players (especially their feet, hence the reason for being set partially below pitch level) without sacrificing the shelter provided by a [[grandstand]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bauckham|first=David |title=Dugouts|publisher=New Holland Publishers (UK) Ltd.|year=2003|ISBN= 1-84537-478-9}}</ref>

The defined space of the technical area was established in the notes section of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] in 1993.<ref name=FIFALaws>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110312104247/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame/law/newsid=1290883.html The Technical Area] Laws of the Game, FIFA</ref>

==Operation==
The technical area is marked by a white line, varying in size but always "1m (1yd) on either side of the designated seated area and extend[ing] forward up to a distance of 1m (1yd) from the touch line", according to the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]].<ref name=FIFALaws/>

Managers may not cross the line during play, which restricts them from approaching the pitch. In 1999, FIFA put the [[fourth official]] in charge of enforcing this rule, although substitutes may [[warm up]] along the side of the pitch.<ref name=FIFALaws/>
