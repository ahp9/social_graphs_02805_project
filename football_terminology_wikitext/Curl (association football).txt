The ball is struck with the inside of his right foot, with his body leaning to the left to generate extra curl on the ball.]]'''Curl''' or '''bend''' in [[association football]] is a definition for a spin on the ball which makes the ball move in a curved direction. When kicking the ball, the inside of the foot is often used to curl the ball, but this can also be done by using the outside of the foot. Similar to curl, the ball can also swerve in the air, without the ''spin'' on the ball which makes the ball curl.<ref>{{Cite web|author1=Soccerpro |date=27 December 2019|title=How to Curve a Soccer Ball|url=https://www.soccerpro.com/theinstep/how-to-curve-a-soccer-ball/|access-date=5 October 2020|website=The Instep|language=en-US|archive-date=12 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201012235139/https://www.soccerpro.com/theinstep/how-to-curve-a-soccer-ball/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Curling or bending the ball is especially used in [[Direct free kick|free kicks]], shots from outside the [[penalty area]] and [[cross (football)|cross]]es. Differences between balls can affect the amount of swerve and curl: traditional [[leather]] footballs were too heavy to curl without great effort, whereas lighter modern footballs curl more easily.

==Nomenclature==
The deviation of a ball from the straight path in the air is known as the curl, or swerve; however, the spin on the ball that causes this is also known as the curl. Shots that curl, bend, or swerve are known as curlers, or in extreme cases, banana shots.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.90min.com/in/posts/6430788-twitter-reacts-as-roberto-carlos-almost-recreates-famous-banana-free-kick |title=Twitter Reacts as Roberto Carlos Almost Recreates Famous Banana Free Kick |publisher=90min.com |date=11 August 2019 |access-date=29 July 2022 |archive-date=29 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220729010409/https://www.90min.com/in/posts/6430788-twitter-reacts-as-roberto-carlos-almost-recreates-famous-banana-free-kick |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Bend it like a Brazilian">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2002/may/19/worldcupfootball2002.football1 |title=Bend it like a Brazilian |work=the Guardian |date=19 May 2002 |access-date=29 July 2022 }}</ref> The technique of putting curl on a ball with the outside of the foot is sometimes known as a '''''trivela''''', a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] term, with [[Ricardo Quaresma]] a notable user of this skill.<ref name="liberation">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jun/29/ricardo-quaresma-outside-of-boot-goal-liberation-world-cup|title=Quaresma chooses liberation over conformity with outside of his boot|first=Barney|last=Ronay|author-link=Barney Ronay|date=29 June 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=13 April 2022}}</ref> The topspin technique of putting straight curl (instead of side curl) on a ball is known as a dip or dipping shot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oJ8oIudXYs|title=How To Score a Dipping Shot {{!}} The Ultimate Guide To Shooting With Dip.|website=[[YouTube]] |date=6 September 2018 |access-date=30 December 2018|archive-date=1 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200501212033/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oJ8oIudXYs&gl=US&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref> Putting no spin on the ball is often used for longer distance kicks, and can cause the ball to dip, or wobble in the air unpredictably.<ref name =fifa1>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=625416.html |title=Who is the free-kick master? |publisher=FIFA.com |date=30 October 2007 |access-date=27 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418062530/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid%3D625416.html |archive-date=18 April 2008 }}</ref> The 1950s Brazilian star [[Didi (footballer, born 1928)|Didi]] is thought to have invented this technique, and used it frequently when taking free kicks, which were known as ''folha seca'' ("dry" or "dead leaf," in Portuguese) free kicks.<ref name="Kings"/><ref name="obituary1">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/may/15/guardianobituaries.football|title=Didi|work=The Guardian|author1=Brian Glanville|date=15 May 2001|access-date=21 February 2017}}</ref><ref name="obituary2">{{cite web|title=Didi|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1330266/Didi.html|publisher=The Telegraph|access-date=21 February 2017|date=15 May 2001}}</ref> Today it is commonly known as the ''[[Knuckleball#Association football|knuckleball]]'' technique;<ref name=fifa1/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00fcef8z0z0|title=Top 10 Knuckleball Goals|website=[[YouTube]] |date=25 March 2017 |access-date=30 December 2018|archive-date=22 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322092342/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00fcef8z0z0&gl=US&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref> this technique has also been described in the media as the "tomahawk",<ref name="dilemma"/> or even the "maledetta" ("accursed," in [[Italian language|Italian]]).<ref name="maledetta"/>

==Usage==
===Free kicks===
[[File:Banana-shape shoot-fr.svg|thumb|right|[[Roberto Carlos]]' bending free kick for Brazil (yellow) against France (blue) in 1997 was struck with the outside of his left foot.<ref name="Bend it like a Brazilian"/>]]
Free kick takers often curl and put spin on the ball, to curl it over or around the wall of defending players, out of the reach of the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. Goalkeepers usually organise walls to cover one side of the goal, and then stand themselves on the other side. Thus, the free kick taker has several choices, from curling the ball around the wall with finesse, to bending the ball around the wall using power, or even going over the {{nowrap|wall{{px2}}{{mdash}}{{px2}}}}although this last lessens the likelihood of scoring from close range.

The 1950s Brazilian star Didi is widely believed to have invented the ''folha seca'' technique;<ref name="Kings"/><ref name="obituary1"/><ref name="obituary2"/> however, Italian forward [[Giuseppe Meazza]] before him is also credited with using the technique.<ref name="The inimitable Giuseppe Meazza">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mensyoutholympic/news/y=2011/m=1/news=the-inimitable-giuseppe-meazza-1363217.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026180026/https://www.fifa.com/mensyoutholympic/news/y%3D2011/m%3D1/news%3Dthe-inimitable-giuseppe-meazza-1363217.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 October 2019|title=The inimitable Giuseppe Meazza|publisher=FIFA.com|access-date=21 January 2015}}</ref><ref name="Evolution of the Free-Kick Master">{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1584379-pele-to-zico-to-beckham-to-ronaldo-evolution-of-the-free-kick-masters |title=Pele to Zico to Beckham to Ronaldo: Evolution of the Free-Kick Masters |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=Tidey |first1=Will |date=23 March 2013 |access-date=26 October 2019 }}</ref><ref name="magliarossonera.it">{{cite web|url=http://www.magliarossonera.it/protagonisti/Gioc-Meazza.html|title=Giuseppe Meazza|publisher=Magliarossonera.it|language=it|access-date=3 January 2016}}</ref><ref name="Technical gifts">{{cite web |url=http://www.giuseppemeazza.it/en/goal-a-invito-meazza |title=Technical gifts |publisher=www.giuseppemeazza.it |access-date=26 October 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/fantasy/story/_/id/27910799/looking-deeper-el-clasico-hold |title=Giuseppe Meazza: Champion of the world |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Hackett |first1=Robin |date=13 September 2012 |access-date=26 October 2019 }}</ref> Today, the ''knuckleball'' technique is notably used by modern-day players such as [[Juninho Pernambucano|Juninho]] (whose technique has often been emulated),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/7ff3d21d-6ff3-480b-b22c-3b198bad381f |title=Noughty Boys: No one hit a free-kick quite like Juninho Pernambucano |publisher=BBC Sport |last1=Anka |first1=Carl |date=16 December 2018 |access-date=26 October 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Ranking the 16 Greatest Free-Kick Takers of All Time |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1886357-ranking-the-16-greatest-free-kick-takers-of-all-time |access-date=15 October 2020 |magazine=Bleacher Report |archive-date=6 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806214301/https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1886357-ranking-the-16-greatest-free-kick-takers-of-all-time |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], who would strike the ball with either no or a low amount of spin, causing it to swerve unexpectedly at a point near the goal.<ref>{{cite news |title=The best free-kick taker EVER: Juninho Pernambucano on how he got so good |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/best-free-kick-taker-ever-juninho-pernambucano-how-he-got-so-good |access-date=15 October 2020 |magazine=Four Four Two |archive-date=10 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210110004758/https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/best-free-kick-taker-ever-juninho-pernambucano-how-he-got-so-good |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Kings"/><ref name="Shooters">{{cite news |title=The Top 15 Best Shooters in World Football |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/748074-the-top-15-best-shooters-in-world-football |access-date=15 October 2020 |magazine=Bleacher Report}}</ref> [[Gareth Bale]]<ref>{{Cite news|last=Wilson|first=Jeremy|date=19 June 2016|title=Gareth Bale's free-kick secrets -

===Corners===
[[File:Magnus force on corner kick goals.svg|thumb|Representation of how the [[Magnus effect]] affects the ball's movement during corner kick goals]]
Curling can be an effective technique when taking [[corner kick|corner]]s. The ball gradually moves in the air towards the goal. This is referred to as an in-swinging corner. Occasionally, a corner-taker will bend the ball towards the edge of the [[penalty area]], for an attacker to [[Volley (football)|volley]], or take a touch and then shoot. Rarely, a goal can be scored directly, this is called an "Olympic goal" and it requires amazing technique and a distraction of the opposing goalkeeper.

===Passing===
Curling can be used in passing. Effective passes from midfield to an attacking player are often the result of a curled pass around the defender, or long cross-field passes are sometimes aided by the addition of curl or [[backspin]]. This can be done with either the inside of the foot or outside of the foot. The outside of the foot may be used when a player is facing sideways and wants to use the dominant foot to make a pass; this technique is known as the ''trivela''.

==Causes==
The fact that spin on a football makes it curl is explained by the [[Magnus effect]]. In brief, a rotating ball creates a [[whirlpool]] of air with itself at its center. Thus, the air on one side of the ball moves in the same direction the ball is travelling in, and the air on the other side moves in the opposite direction. This creates a difference in [[air pressure]] around the ball, and it is this sustained difference in pressure which causes the course of the ball to deviate.<ref name="Magnus"/>

The Magnus effect is named after German physicist [[Heinrich Magnus|Heinrich Gustav Magnus]], who described the effect in 1852.<ref name="Magnus">G. Magnus (1852) "Über die Abweichung der Geschosse," ''Abhandlungen der Königlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin'', pages 1-23.</ref> In 1672, [[Isaac Newton]] had described it and correctly inferred the cause after observing [[Real tennis|tennis]] players in his [[Cambridge]] college.<ref>Isaac Newton, "A letter of Mr. Isaac Newton, of the University of Cambridge, containing his new theory about light and color," ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'', vol. 7, pages 3075-3087 (1671-1672). (Note: In this letter, Newton tried to explain the refraction of light by arguing that rotating particles of light curve as they moved through a medium just as a rotating tennis ball curves as it moves through the air.)</ref><ref>Gleick, James. 2004.
