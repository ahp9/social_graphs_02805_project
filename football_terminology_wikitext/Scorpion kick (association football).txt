The '''scorpion kick''', also known as a '''reverse [[bicycle kick]]''' or '''back hammer kick''', is a physical move in [[association football]] that is achieved by diving or throwing the body forwards and then placing the hands on the ground to lunge the back heels forward to kick an incoming ball.<ref>Bob Wilson, ''Peculiar Sporting Lingo'', p. 369</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Scorpion-kick dictionary definition {{!}} scorpion-kick defined|url=https://www.yourdictionary.com/scorpion-kick|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Yourdictionary.com}}</ref> Sports historian Andreas Campomar praises the manoeuvre as remarkable, noting that it "demonstrated that the spectacle had not died: that the game, in spite of its many flaws, could provide moments of glory that had little to do with just victory or defeat."<ref>Campomar, ''Golazo!''</ref>

Although [[René Higuita]] is often credited with popularising the move,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Fy8b-KjxQQC&dq=Scorpion+kick&pg=PA125|title=Essential Soccer Skills|first=D. K.|last=Publishing|date=21 February 2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780756673932|via=Google Books}}</ref> the scorpion kick was first performed by Paraguayan forward [[Arsenio Erico]] on 12 August 1934, when he scored a goal for [[Independiente de Avellaneda]] in a match against [[Boca Juniors]], in front of 50,000 spectators. Following a cross from [[Antonio Sastre]], Erico attempted a header by diving forward, but as he failed to connect with the ball properly, he resolved the play with an aerial backheel, scoring a goal that surprised the crowd. Initially referred to as the "''balancín''" (translated as 'seesaw' in English),<ref name=esco>{{Cite news |last=Candia López |first=Alberto |url=https://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/deportes/arsenio-erico-concibio-la-excelencia-del-futbol-arte-73881.html |title=Arsenio Erico concibió la excelencia del fútbol-arte |date=1 February 2010 |work=[[ABC Color]] |access-date=27 February 2025 |language=es |trans-title=Arsenio Erico conceived the excellence of football as an art}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.abc.com.py/deportes/erico-marco-goles-con-el-escorpion-1010451.html |title=Erico marcó goles con el "Escorpión" |date=19 September 2007 |access-date=27 February 2025 |work=ABC Color |language=es |trans-title=Erico scored goals with the "Scorpion" kick}}</ref> the move was later associated with Higuita after his iconic performance in a 1995 [[international friendly]] match between [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] and [[England national football team|England]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOwQ82EArigC&dq=Scorpion+kick&pg=PA26|title=Soccer: The Ultimate Guide|last=DK|date=19 April 2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780756673215|via=Google Books}}</ref>

The move gets its name from the player's resemblance to a [[scorpion]]'s tail while performing the kick.

On top of the regular '''diving''' scorpion kick, there are also other variations such as '''standing''' scorpion kick<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea-Sb_CooaA |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/Ea-Sb_CooaA |archive-date=22 December 2021 |url-status=live|title=Fifa 12 STANDING scorpion kick and diving scorpion kick|website=YouTube|date=13 October 2011 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> and '''spinning''' scorpion kick, neither of which necessarily result in the hands being placed on the ground.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T90ZMY6CzIM |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/T90ZMY6CzIM |archive-date=22 December 2021 |url-status=live|title=Biava: goal of the year|website=YouTube|date=27 November 2006 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> Swedish forward [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]] is a notable exponent for the standing scorpion kick,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0B2IKXRs3Y |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/T0B2IKXRs3Y |archive-date=22 December 2021 |url-status=live|title=Sublime scorpion goal Zlatan IBRAHIMOVIC (10') - Paris Saint-Germain - SC Bastia (4-0) - 2013/2014|website=YouTube|date=20 October 2013 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> while the Italian defender [[Giuseppe Biava]] is a notable exponent of the spinning scorpion kick.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=27 December 2016|title=Top 6 Scorpion Kicks of all time|url=https://www.foottheball.com/football-top-10/top-6-scorpion-kicks-football/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 September 2020|website=www.foottheball.com}}</ref>
