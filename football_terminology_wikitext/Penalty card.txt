'''Penalty cards''' are used in many sports as a means of warning, reprimanding or penalising a player, coach or team official. Penalty cards are most commonly used by [[referee]]s or umpires to indicate that a player has committed an offence. The official will hold the card above their head while looking or pointing toward the player who has committed the offence. This action makes the decision clear to all players, as well as spectators and other officials in a manner that is language-neutral. The colour or shape of the card used by the official indicates the type or seriousness of the offence and the level of punishment that is to be applied. Yellow and red cards are the most common, typically indicating, respectively, cautions and [[Ejection (sports)|dismissals]].

==History and origin==
The idea of using a universal language – neutral coloured cards – to communicate a referee's intentions originated in [[association football]], with English referee [[Ken Aston]].<ref name="KenAston">{{Cite web | url = https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/footballdevelopment/technicalsupport/refereeing/news/newsid=80623/index.html | title = Ken Aston – the inventor of yellow and red cards | publisher = fifa.com | access-date = February 20, 2013 | archive-date = April 30, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150430120548/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/footballdevelopment/technicalsupport/refereeing/news/newsid=80623/index.html | url-status = dead }}</ref> Aston had been appointed to the [[FIFA]] Referees' Committee and was responsible for all referees at the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]]. In the [[1966 FIFA World Cup#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]], [[England national football team|England]] played [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. After the match, newspaper reports stated that referee [[Rudolf Kreitlein]] had cautioned Englishmen [[Bobby Charlton|Bobby]] and [[Jack Charlton]], as well as sent off Argentinian [[Antonio Rattín]]. The referee had not made his decision clear during the game, so England manager [[Alf Ramsey]] approached a FIFA representative for post-match clarification. This incident started Aston thinking about ways to make a referee's decisions clearer to both players and spectators. Aston realised that a colour-coding scheme based on the same principle as used on [[traffic light]]s (yellow – stop if safe to do so, red – stop) would transcend language barriers and make it clear that a player had been cautioned or expelled.<ref name=KenAston/> As a result, yellow cards to indicate a caution and red cards to indicate an expulsion were used for the first time  in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico. The use of penalty cards has since been adopted and expanded by several sporting codes, with each sport adapting the idea to its specific set of rules or laws.

==Commonly used penalty cards==

===Yellow card===
[[Image:Yellow card.svg|thumb|A yellow card is used in several sports and most commonly indicates a warning or a temporary suspension. Two of them are always and most commonly followed by a red card.]]

A '''yellow card''' is used in many different sporting codes. Its meaning differs among sports; however, it most commonly indicates a caution given to a player regarding their conduct, or indicates a temporary suspension. Examples include:

====Association football====
{{main|Yellow card (association football)}}
In [[association football]], a yellow card is shown by the [[Referee (association football)|referee]] to indicate that a player has been officially cautioned.<ref name="FIFAwebsite">{{Cite web | url = https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html/ | title = Laws of the Game | publisher = fifa.com | access-date = June 6, 2008 | archive-date = June 6, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080606225303/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html | url-status = dead }}</ref> The player's details are then recorded by the referee in a small notebook; hence a caution is also known as a "booking". A player who has been cautioned may continue playing in the game; however, a player who receives a second caution in a match is sent off (shown the [[Yellow card (association football)|yellow card]] again, and then a [[Red card (association football)|red card]]), meaning that they must leave the field immediately and take no further part in the game. The player may not be replaced by a substitute. Law 12 of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] (which are set by the [[International Football Association Board]] and used by [[FIFA]]) lists the [[Misconduct (association football)|types of offences and misconduct]] that may result in a caution or is cautionary. Law 12 was amended in 2019 to allow team officials, such as head coaches, to also receive yellow and red cards.<ref name="FIFAwebsite" /> It also states that "only a player, substitute, substituted player or team official" can be cautioned. A player is usually given a one-match suspension (although it can be more for certain circumstances) after accumulating two yellow cards in a match. The same is generally applied to team officials.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-07|title=Football Discipline - Yellow Cards, Red Cards and Suspensions, explained|url=https://thepfsa.co.uk/football-discipline-yellow-cards-red-cards-and-suspensions-explained/|access-date=2021-12-16|website=The PFSA|language=en-GB}}</ref>[[File:Ronaldo yellow card.jpg|thumb|Portuguese footballer [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] (in red) is shown the yellow card]]{{pb}}In most tournaments, the accumulation of a certain number of yellow cards over several matches results in disqualification of the offending player for a certain number of subsequent matches, the exact number of cards and matches varying by jurisdiction.

====Athletics====
In [[Sport of athletics|track events]], a yellow card is used as a personal warning in both track and field events used to indicate that a second yellow card followed by a red card would result in a disqualification.<ref name="athgreencard">{{cite web|url=http://www.european-athletics.org/files/12-starting_guidelines-april2009.pdf|title=IAAF Starting Guidelines|access-date=2012-08-07|archive-date=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607132150/http://www.european-athletics.org/files/12-starting_guidelines-april2009.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> [[World Athletics]] rules have abolished false start warnings; false starts now result in immediate disqualification except in combined events where a diagonal yellow/black card indicates a warning for false start.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/6018077/World-Athletics-IAAF-sanctions-immediate-disqualification-for-false-starts-come-January.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=IAAF sanctions immediate disqualification for false starts come January | date=August 12, 2009 | access-date=August 25, 2015 | archive-date=January 18, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210118111656/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/6018077/World-Athletics-IAAF-sanctions-immediate-disqualification-for-false-starts-come-January.html | url-status=live }}</ref>  However, as of 2012, the false start rule is that an athlete's hands must leave the track or their feet must leave the starting blocks before the gunshot in order for a false start to be given. Therefore, if an athlete makes a twitch, while being in their final 'set' position, the maximum penalty is a yellow card.

====Australian football====
In [[Australian rules football]], a yellow card is issued against a player for committing any reportable offence (such as striking an opponent, swearing at an official, amongst others), except those listed as 'serious' reportable offences. Any player issued a yellow card is unable to participate in the game for the length of a quarter of play, excluding breaks, although the player can be replaced. However, a yellow card may be issued against a player at the discretion of an umpire, despite the player not committing a reportable offence. Yellow cards and red cards are, however, not issued in the [[Australian Football League]], the highest level of play in Australian rules football.<ref name="AFL Laws of the Game">{{Cite web | url = http://afl.com.au/Portals/0/2012/AM_6967_0112_AFL_laws.pdf | title = AFL Laws of the Game | publisher = AFL Commission | access-date = October 20, 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120522111034/http://afl.com.au/Portals/0/2012/AM_6967_0112_AFL_laws.pdf | archive-date = May 22, 2012 }}</ref>

====Badminton====
In [[badminton]], a yellow card is given to a singles player or doubles pair as a warning for breaching the Laws of Badminton. A yellow card can only be given once to a player or pair in a match; subsequent breaches are sanctioned with a red or black card.<ref name="badmintonlaws">{{cite web|title=Laws of badminton|url=http://www.bwfbadminton.org/file.aspx?id=608602&dl=1|website=bwfbadminton.org|publisher=[[Badminton World Federation]]|access-date=1 March 2015|pages=10–11|archive-date=20 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320083001/http://bwfbadminton.org/file.aspx?id=608602&dl=1|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="badmintontechnical">{{cite web|title=Recommendations to technical officials|url=http://www.bwfbadminton.org/file.aspx?id=550377&dl=1|website=bwfbadminton.org|publisher=[[Badminton World Federation]]|access-date=1 March 2015|pages=8–9|archive-date=16 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116031642/http://www.bwfbadminton.org/file.aspx?id=550377&dl=1|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Bandy====
In [[bandy]], a yellow card indicates a warning given to an entire team for technical fouls such as errors in the execution of goal-throws or free strokes, or the obstruction of a player without ball.<ref name="Bandywebsite">{{Cite web | url = http://www.internationalbandy.com/ | title = Bandy – Rules of Play | publisher = internationalbandy.com | access-date = June 10, 2008 | archive-date = June 22, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090622035711/http://www.internationalbandy.com/ | url-status = live }}</ref> Subsequent technical fouls by the same team result in a five-minute penalty indicated by a [[Penalty card#White card|white card]].

====Canoe polo====
In [[canoe polo]], a yellow card indicates a player has received a two-minute temporary suspension.<ref name="CPrules">{{Cite web|url=http://www.canoepolonz.org.nz/default.asp?Page=2996 |title=International Canoe Polo – Rules of Play |publisher=canoepolonz.org.nz |access-date=June 12, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014053924/http://www.canoepolonz.org.nz/default.asp?Page=2996 |archive-date=October 14, 2008 }}</ref> A yellow card can be awarded for a deliberate or dangerous foul that prevents the scoring of a near certain goal, dangerous illegal play that is deliberate or repeated, foul or abusive language, continuously disputing a referee's decisions or receiving a third green card for any reason.

====Equestrian sports====
In [[equestrian sports]], yellow cards may be issued during [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] sanctioned events for abuse of a horse or incorrect behavior towards an official.<ref name="Erules">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fei.org/Rules/Documents/GeneralRegulations_22ndedition_effective1June2007.pdf |title=FEI General Regulations |website=fei.org |access-date=September 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704030028/http://www.fei.org/Rules/Documents/GeneralRegulations_22ndedition_effective1June2007.pdf |archive-date=July 4, 2008 }}</ref> Abuse of the horse may include riding an obviously lame horse, riding an exhausted horse, excessive use of [[whip]] or [[spur]]s, and dangerous riding. Riders may choose not to accept issued cards, but doing so may lead to a disciplinary hearing. A rider receiving a yellow card can be disqualified from the event and subsequently fined or suspended.<ref name="Erules"/>

====Fencing====
In [[Fencing (sport)|fencing]], a yellow card indicates a warning to a fencer and is valid for the remainder of the bout.<ref name="Fencingrules">{{Cite web | url = http://www.britishfencing.com/governance/rules/fie-rules/ | title = FIE Competition Rules | publisher = britishfencing.com | access-date = Sep 8, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100716223112/http://www.britishfencing.com/governance/rules/fie-rules/ | archive-date = July 16, 2010 | url-status = dead }}</ref> In some cases, an annulment of any hit scored by the fencer at fault may also occur. Yellow cards are awarded for "Tier 1" offenses, such as turning your back to your opponent, covering target area (most common in Foil), leaving the piste without permission, or refusing to obey the referee. A yellow card can also be awarded when, at the first call by the referee, a fencer does not present himself on the piste ready to fence. Any person not on the piste who disturbs the good order of the competition may also receive a yellow card on the first infringement.<ref name="Fencingrules"/>

====Field hockey====
Yellow cards in [[field hockey]] indicate a temporary suspension of at least 5 minutes. The length of the suspension is determined by the umpire.<ref name="Rules of Hockey">{{Cite web | url = http://www.fih.ch/media/807896/fih-rules-of-hockey-2015.pdf | title = Rules of Hockey | publisher = FIH | access-date = November 16, 2016 | archive-date = February 15, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170215001739/http://www.fih.ch/media/807896/fih-rules-of-hockey-2015.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref> It is possible for a player to receive two yellow cards for different offences during the same match; however, the period of suspension must be significantly longer with each yellow card. When an offence for which a yellow card has been awarded is repeated, the yellow card must not be used again and a more severe penalty must be awarded. There must also be a clear difference between the duration of a yellow card suspension for a minor offence and the duration for a major offence. The yellow card can be shown to a specific player or to the captain for misconduct by the entire team.<ref name="Rules of Hockey"/> In this case, the captain is temporarily suspended.

====Gaelic games====
In the [[Gaelic games]] of [[camogie]], [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]], and [[ladies' Gaelic football]],  yellow cards ({{Langx|ga|cárta buí}}) are given to players for moderate fouls. A player who receives two yellow cards in a single game is sent off and receives a red card. Red and yellow cards were introduced to Gaelic games following an incident during the [[1995 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]] when the referee sent [[Charlie Redmond]] from the field of play but he refused to leave.<ref name=gaelic_echoes_of_1995>{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Sweeney |url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2019/0106/1020607-leitrim-sent-off/|title=Leitrim player sent off, plays on and sets up vital score|work=[[RTÉ Sport]]|date=7 January 2019|quote=There's echoes of Dublin's Charlie Redmond in the 1995 All-Ireland football final, who was sent off in the second half against Tyrone by referee Paddy Russell, but stayed on the field.

====Handball====
A yellow card in [[handball]] indicates a warning and can be given to a player or team official for [[unsportsmanlike conduct]], or to a player whose actions are mainly or exclusively directed at the opponent and not at the ball. [[International Handball Federation|IHF]] rules also allow referees to use discretion to award a yellow card outside of these situations.<ref name="IHF rules">{{Cite web | url = https://archive.ihf.info/ | title = International Handball Federation – Rules of the Game 2005 | publisher = ihf.info | access-date = June 8, 2008 | archive-date = June 30, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190630052043/http://archive.ihf.info/ | url-status = live }}</ref>

==== Loofball ====

In [[loofball]], [[misconduct]] attracts either a verbal warning, a yellow or red card. While a verbal warning carries no penalty, a yellow card carries a point penalty and a red card carries both a point penalty and disqualification. A player usually gets sanctioned in the following order: first misconduct = verbal warning, second misconduct = yellow card + point to the opposition, third misconduct = red card + point to the opposition + disqualification.

====Mixed martial arts====
*[[Mixed martial arts]] promotions [[Pride Fighting Championships|PRIDE]] (defunct), [[Deep (mixed martial arts)|DEEP]], and [[ZST]]: A warning, the third leads to disqualification.

==== Pedagogics ====
Following team sports, the concept of “yellow card” began to be experimentally used in [[pedagogy]], as a temporary point restriction by the [[teacher]] of individual students, due to their unsatisfactory behavior, in the right to receive “prearranged points” in lesson.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Artiukhov |first=A.

====Racewalking====
<!--Image requested|Paddles issued when you break the rules in a race walk-->
A yellow card in [[racewalking]] indicates a competitor's foot fails to be on the ground when the rear leg is being raised, or the front leg is not straightened when it makes contact with the ground.<ref name="What is Olympic Race Walking">{{cite web|url=http://trackandfield.about.com/od/distanceevents/a/olymwalkbasic.htm|title=Olympic Race Walking Basics|author=Mike Rosenbaum|work=About.com Sports|access-date=2009-04-10|archive-date=2016-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220141925/http://trackandfield.about.com/od/distanceevents/a/olymwalkbasic.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Rugby league====
Yellow cards in [[rugby league]] indicate a 10-minute [[sin bin]]. In the UK's [[Super League]] a physical yellow card is used, however in Australia's [[National Rugby League]] referees indicating a sin bin by raising both arms straight out with fingers spread (to indicate 10 minutes).

====Rugby union====

In [[rugby sevens]], any player who commits an offence under [[World Rugby]] Law 9 – Foul Play may be shown a yellow card and suspended from the game for 2 minutes without replacement.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/?law=9&variation=2 |title=Law 9 – Foul Play (Sevens Variation) |work=Laws of the Game: Rugby Union |publisher=World Rugby |access-date=21 March 2018 |archive-date=1 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201135244/https://laws.worldrugby.org/?law=9&variation=2 |url-status=live }}</ref> Offences include obstruction, unfair play, repeated infringements, dangerous play and misconduct which is prejudicial to the game. Receiving a yellow card is known colloquially as being sent to the "sin bin". If that player later commits another yellow-card offence, the player will be shown a red card (see below) and be [[ejection (sports)|sent-off]].

Under [[World Rugby]] Laws, any [[rugby union]] player who commits an offence under Law 9 – Foul Play may be shown a yellow card and suspended from the game for 10 minutes; the player cannot be replaced during that time.<ref name="World Rugby laws">{{Cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/?law=9 |title=Law 9 – Foul Play |work=Laws of the Game: Rugby Union |publisher=World Rugby |access-date=21 March 2018 |archive-date=1 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201135242/https://laws.worldrugby.org/?law=9 |url-status=live }}</ref> Offences include obstruction, unfair play, repeated infringements, dangerous play and misconduct which is prejudicial to the game.

====Table tennis====
Under [[International Table Tennis Federation|ITTF]] regulations, a yellow card is shown by the umpire to warn the player if they misbehave. If the player commits a second offence, one point is awarded to the opponent and two points for further offence, each time with a yellow and a red card together shown by the umpire. A yellow card can also be shown to an authorized advisor if they give advice illegally.<ref name="Table tennis">{{cite book|year=2019 |title=The International Table Tennis Federation Handbook |url= https://ittf.cdnomega.com/eu/2019/08/2019ITTFHandbook_v2.pdf|publisher= The International Table Tennis Federation|pages=54,55 |access-date= September 4, 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190904022838/https://ittf.cdnomega.com/eu/2019/08/2019ITTFHandbook_v2.pdf|archive-date= September 4, 2019|url-status= dead}}</ref>

====Volleyball====
Under FIVB rules, receiving a yellow card is the second stage of a formal warning for a player(s)/coach for minor misconduct, the first being a verbal one given through the team captain. It is recorded on the scoresheet but has no immediate consequences; there is no loss of service (if applicable) and no point awarded to the opposition. It is shown together with a red card (in one hand) where a player(s)/coach is sanctioned with expulsion, and (with a card in each hand) separately with a red card where a player(s)/coach is sanctioned with disqualification, all such offences are recorded on the scoresheet.

====Water polo====
Yellow cards are given in [[water polo]] as an official warning for disrespectful conduct from the coach, individual players, or the entire bench.

==== Wrestling ====
In Germany, Austria, and [[Calgary]], Canada, yellow cards were traditionally given for a first or second severe infraction of the rules in [[wrestling]].

===Red card===
[[Image:Red card.svg|thumb|A red card is used in several sports and most commonly indicates an extreme offense and can often mean that a player has been eliminated from the game and may be excluded from further games as well.]]

A '''red card''' is used in several different sporting codes. Its meaning differs among sports, but it most commonly indicates a serious offence and often results in a player being permanently suspended from the game (commonly known as an [[Ejection (sports)|ejection]], dismissal, disqualification, expulsion, removal, or sending-off). In many sports the ejected player's team cannot replace them and thus must continue the rest of the game with one less player, which may be a significant disadvantage. Examples include:

====Association football====
{{for|more details|Red card (association football)}}
In [[association football]], a red card is shown by a [[Referee (association football)|referee]] to signify that a player has been sent off.<ref name="FIFAwebsite"/> A player who has been sent off is required to leave the field of play immediately and must take no further part in the game.  The player who has been sent off cannot be replaced during the game; their team must continue the game with one player fewer. Only players, substitutes, substituted players and team officials may receive a red card. If a goalkeeper receives a red card another player must assume goalkeeping duties (so teams will usually [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] an outfield player for another goalkeeper if this option is available). A red card will be shown to a player who has committed a serious or extreme offense such as violent conduct or an illegal and purposeful obstruction of a goal scoring opportunity for the opposing team. A red card will also be shown to a player who accumulates two [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)#Yellow card (caution)|yellow cards]] for more minor offenses.

====Athletics====
A red card in [[Sport of athletics|athletics]] indicates that the athlete is disqualified after receiving two yellow cards. A diagonal red/black card is issued if a false start has been made.<ref name="athgreencard"/>

====Australian rules football====
In [[Australian rules football]], a red card is issued against a player who has accumulated two yellow cards over the course of a match, or has committed a 'serious reportable offence' (such as striking an umpire or kicking an opponent). A player issued with a red card may not participate for the remainder of the match; however, unlike most sports, the player can be replaced, although not until a length of time equivalent to one-quarter (excluding breaks) has elapsed. Yellow cards and red cards are, however, not issued in the [[Australian Football League]], the highest level of play in Australian rules football.<ref name="AFL Laws of the Game"/>

====Badminton====
In [[badminton]], a red card is given to a singles player or doubles pair to penalize subsequent infractions after receiving a yellow card. It counts as fault, meaning the opposing side is awarded a point. After a second red card, a player or pair may be disqualified with a black card at the tournament referee's discretion.<ref name="badmintonlaws"/><ref name="badmintontechnical"/>

====Bandy====
A red card in [[bandy]] indicates a [[match penalty]], i.e. a player has been excluded for the remainder of the match and cannot be substituted.<ref name="Bandywebsite"/> Red card offenses include directly attacking an opponent or using abusive language. A coach or substitute may also be penalized with a red card. In this situation, a player currently on the rink also serves a ten-minute penalty, resulting in the number of players being reduced by one.

====Canoe polo====
A red card in [[canoe polo]] indicates a player has been sent off for the remainder of the match and cannot be substituted.<ref name="CPrules"/> A red card can be awarded if a personal attack on a player occurs, repeated foul or abusive language, or when the award of a yellow card is disputed or has not had the desired effect of causing the player to control his play or attitude. A red card is also awarded when a player has received a second yellow card for any reason.

====Cricket====
Red cards are used in some cricket tournaments as part of efforts to penalise fielding sides for slow [[Over rate|over rates]]. The penalised team's captain must select a teammate to be removed, and their side must complete the innings with one less fielder.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mukherjee |first=Abhishek |date=2023-08-13 |title=Explained: The 'Red Card' Rule That Will Enable Umpires To Send Off Cricketers At The CPL And WCPL For Poor Over Rates |url=https://www.wisden.com/cricket-news/explained-the-red-card-rule-that-will-enable-umpires-to-send-off-cricketers-at-the-cpl-and-wcpl-for-poor-over-rates |access-date=4 April 2025 |website=Wisden |language=en-GB}}</ref>

====Fencing====
In [[fencing]], a red card is used to indicate that a fencer has committed an offence that warrants a penalty hit to be awarded to the opponent.<ref name="Fencingrules"/> Second and subsequent Group 1 offences, all Group 2 offences and first Group 3 offences are penalised with a red card.<ref name="Fencingrules"/> A red card may also be awarded when, at the second call by the referee, a fencer does not present himself on the piste ready to fence.

====Field hockey====
A red card in [[field hockey]] results in a player being permanently suspended from the game. The player cannot take any further part in the game and cannot be substituted. Unlike other penalty cards in field hockey, the red card is never given to the captain for team misconduct. In addition to their colour, red cards in field hockey are often circular in shape.<ref name="Rules of Hockey"/>

====Floorball====
In [[floorball]], a red card results in the player being ejected from the game and his/her team being penalised with a major 4-minute bench penalty. In floorball, the red card can be linked with 2 different types of Match Penalties. Technical match penalty is linked with playing with wrong equipment or etc. technical faults; this penalty does not cause additional suspension in the tournament. Match penalty is linked with offences such as sabotage of the game, mild brawl (no punches), and is also given when a player receives his/her second major 4-minute bench penalty also with vulgar conduct, such as insulting the referee, another player or spectators, violent conduct that is not directly linked with play (such as punching an opponent); this match penalty causes an automatic 1-game suspension, and is further reviewed by a disciplinary committee that can penalise the player with additional suspension.
[[Image:Cropped-red-card-handball.jpg|thumb|right|A red card shown in a handball match]]

====Gaelic games====
In [[camogie]], [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]] and [[ladies' Gaelic football]] a red card ({{Langx|ga|cárta dearg}}) is given to players for serious fouls and violent conduct. A player who receives two yellow cards in a single game, or a yellow card and then a black card, is sent off and receives a red card. Red and yellow cards were introduced to Gaelic games following an incident during the [[1995 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]] when the referee sent [[Charlie Redmond]] from the field of play but he refused to leave.<ref name=gaelic_echoes_of_1995/>

A red card in [[handball]] indicates a disqualification of a player who has committed an offense such as unsportsmanlike conduct, serious foul play, or receiving a third two-minute suspension.<ref name="IHF rules"/> A red card prevents a player from playing for the remainder of the match and as a result reduces the number of players that are available to a team.  A red card also carries a two-minute suspension for the team, meaning that a team cannot replace the disqualified player until the two-minute team suspension has expired.<ref name="IHF rules"/>

====Quadball====
In [[Quidditch (sport)|quadball]] a red card results in a player being ejected from the game. In addition, a substitute must go to the penalty box for two minutes. The entire two minutes must be served, regardless of any scores by the opposing team during that time. The player's team must play a player down while the substitute is in the penalty box.<ref name="quidditchrules">{{cite web|title=Quidditch Rulebook|url=http://www.usquidditch.org/files/USQ_Rulebook_15.pdf|access-date=2021-07-25|archive-date=2021-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210708211712/https://www.usquidditch.org/files/USQ_Rulebook_15.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Racewalking====
In [[racewalking]], a red card indicates that a competitor's foot failed to be on the ground when the rear leg is being raised or that his front leg is not straightened when it makes contact with the ground.  A judge would issue a yellow card for the first infraction committed by a competitor. And if the same judge detects the second infraction from the same competitor, a red card is issued.  Three red cards, from three different judges, will result in a competitor's disqualification.<ref name="What is Olympic Race Walking"/>

====Rugby league====
*In [[Rugby league]] a red cards signals a player's sending off with no replacement permitted. In the UK's [[Super League]] a physical red card is used, however in Australia's [[National Rugby League]] referees usually indicate a player sending off with one extended arm above the head with the index finger pointed in the direction of a sideline. Multiple yellow cards do not necessarily equal a red card, it is instead up to the referee's discretion at how bad the offenses are, and in these cases, a red card may be shown for a second yellow card offense without the referee presenting the second yellow card first.

====Rugby union====
*In [[Rugby union]] a red card is used to indicate that a player has been sent off and can take no further part in the game.<ref name="World Rugby laws"/> Traditionally, the player could not be replaced, leaving their team with one less player for the remainder of the game, although in certain cases, a player sent off may be replaced with a substitute after twenty minutes. During matches, a player who commits an offense under Law 9 – Foul Play may be shown a red card. Red cards are normally issued for serious offenses, i.e. tackling an opponent above the line of their shoulders. Any player receiving a second yellow card in a game will automatically be shown a red card.

====Volleyball====
* In [[volleyball]], a red card can be issued by the referee for the first instance of Rude Conduct. It is recorded on the scoresheet and results in loss of service (if applicable) and a penalty point to the opposition. Rude Conduct is the only category of sanction punished by a Red card alone, and which results in loss of service (if applicable) and a penalty point. For the sanctions of Expulsion and Disqualification, a Red and Yellow card is shown simultaneously, held together in one hand, or separately in each hand, respectively.
* [[beach volleyball|Two Man (beach)]]:  The rules vary in one aspect from the six-a-side competition. A red card is shown for the first and any second offense of Rude Conduct in the same set. It is recorded on the scoresheet, resulting in loss of service (if applicable) and a penalty point to the opposition. Otherwise the procedural use of cards is the same as for six-a-side.

====Water polo====
In [[water polo]], a red card is issued to a coach, player, or team official on the bench for a second incident of misconduct after receiving a yellow card or severe unsporting conduct. A person receiving a red card must leave the competition area.

====Wrestling====
In the same territories as listed above under yellow cards, red cards were traditionally given for a third severe infraction of the rules, signifying disqualification.

====Table tennis====
Under [[International Table Tennis Federation|ITTF]] regulations, if after a warning the player misbehaves again, the umpire will show him or her a yellow card and a red card together and award one point to the opponent for the second offence and two for the third one. In case a player commits a serious offence or continues to misbehave after 3 points are awarded to the opponent for misbehavior, the umpire will suspend play and report to the referee, who has the power to disqualify the player from the match, showing a red card. The umpire can show a red card to an authorised advisor and ask them to leave the playing area if they give illegal advice after a warning had been given.<ref name="Table tennis"/>

==Other types of penalty card==

===Green card===
[[Image:greencardhockey.svg|thumb|In [[field hockey]], a triangular-shaped green card indicates a 2-minute suspension for field players and a warning for a coach.]]

[[File:Indiana (80) (5028145116).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Penn State Nittany Lions field hockey|Penn State]] field hockey player receives a green card.]]
A '''green card''' is used in some sports to indicate an official warning to a player who has committed a minor offence that does not warrant a more serious, extreme or further sanction.
====Association football====
Among others, [[Italy]]’s [[Serie B]] uses green cards to display a positive action by a player. The only positive card a referee has, it helps determine sportsmanship awards at the end of the season. On the other hand, in some instances, a green card is used for discipline. In some smaller leagues, a green card is used for situations such as unsportsmanlike conduct, diving, or minor dissent. In the [[2018 CONIFA World Football Cup|2018 CONIFA World Cup]], any player given a green card had to exit the field right away. Teams that had a substitution available could bring in another player as a replacement, but those who had no more replacements left had to play with one less player.<ref name="Soccer Penalty Cards">{{cite news|title=Soccer Penalty Cards|url=https://www.rookieroad.com/soccer/basics/penalty-cards/|access-date=5 March 2023|archive-date=26 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326025134/https://www.rookieroad.com/soccer/basics/penalty-cards/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Green Card In Soccer: Explained">{{cite news |title= Green Card In Soccer: Explained|url= https://soccerprime.com/green-card-in-soccer-explained/|access-date=5 March 2023}}</ref> 
====[[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]]====
A green card indicates that the recall did not warrant a warning, which most commonly happens when the machines used to catch false-starters making a mistake.<ref name="athgreencard"/>

====[[Canoe polo]]====
A green card indicates an official warning that can be applied to an individual player or a whole team.<ref name="CPrules"/> A green card can be awarded for deliberate unsporting behavior or unnecessary verbal communication to the referee.
====[[Field hockey]]====
A green card indicates an official warning when a minor offence has occurred resulting in a 2 minute suspension. A second green card for the same player will result in a yellow card (5 minute suspension). In this case, the umpire will show a green card, followed by a yellow card. When an offence for which a green card has been awarded is repeated, a yellow card should be awarded. A green card can be given to a specific player or to the captain as a warning to the entire team. Cards shown to the captain as a warning to the team are treated separate from cards shown to the captain as a player. A captain who receives a green card is ‘cautioned’ rather than suspended (as with a yellow or red card) and therefore this does not need an alternate captain to be named on the field. In addition to their colour, green cards in field hockey are triangular in shape.<ref name="Rules of Hockey"/> Under FIH Rules of Hockey, the green card carries a two-minute suspension during which time that player's team plays with one less player.

===White card===
[[Image:White card.svg|thumb|In bandy, a white card indicates a five-minute penalty. Half the time of when the player is given the blue card.]]
====Association football====
In a women's cup game between Benfica and Sporting in Portugal, a white card has been shown to praise fair play for the first time in association football history.<ref name="3rd card being introduced to football?">{{cite news |last=Farrant |first=Theo |date=25 January 2023 |title=Referee shows a white card for the first time in football history: But why? |url=https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/01/25/referee-shows-a-white-card-for-the-first-time-in-football-history-but-why |access-date=27 October 2025 |work=[[Euronews]]}}</ref>
====[[Bandy]]==== 
A '''white card''' is used in bandy to indicate a five-minute timed penalty given to a player.<ref name="Bandywebsite"/> The offending player must leave the playing area and wait on a penalty bench near the centre line until the penalty has expired. During the 5 minute period the player may not be replaced. However, a different player may replace them when the penalty has expired. Offences that can warrant a white card include trying to hinder the opponents from executing a free-stroke, illegal substitution or repeated illegal but non-violent attacks on an opponent.

====[[Rugby union]]====
In the 2012 [[Super Rugby]] season in rugby union, a White Card was introduced for incidents of suspected foul play where the referee is unsure of the identity of the perpetrator, or where the referee is unsure if a red card is warranted. The incident is later referred to the citing commissioner, and may result in a suspension for the offending player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/super-rugby-2012/rugby/story/159785.html|title=Super Rugby: White card set for Super Rugby bow - Live Rugby News - ESPN Scrum|work=ESPN scrum|access-date=2012-03-02|archive-date=2012-02-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223033701/http://www.espnscrum.com/super-rugby-2012/rugby/story/159785.html|url-status=live}}</ref> It is similar to a citation sign (arms crossed above the head) in rugby league. However, in 2013 the International Rugby Board, now known as World Rugby, extended the powers of the [[Rugby union match officials#Television match official|TMO]] to include reviewing suspected incidents of foul play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby365.com/article/51557-new-tmo-protocol|title=Rugby365 - New TMO protocol|work=rugby365.com|access-date=2013-09-15|archive-date=2013-12-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213232902/http://www.rugby365.com/article/51557-new-tmo-protocol|url-status=live}}</ref> As a result, the white cards were obsolete a year after they have been introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/super-rugby/8982249/Rennie-apologises-for-bizarre-semi-incident|title=Rennie apologises for bizarre semi incident|work=Stuff|date=30 July 2013 |access-date=2013-09-15|archive-date=2014-10-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018231606/http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/super-rugby/8982249/Rennie-apologises-for-bizarre-semi-incident|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Blue card===
[[Image:Blue card.svg|thumb|In bandy, a blue card indicates a ten-minute penalty. Double the time of the player who is given the white card.]]
====Association football==== 
A blue card is frequently used in indoor football in the United States as a level below a yellow card for offenses such as breaking house safety rules, spitting on the field, committing minor physical fouls, or illegal substitutions,<ref name="Soccer Penalty Cards"/> signifying that the offender must leave the field and stay in a penalty box (usually 2–5 minutes), during which time their team plays down a man (identical to [[ice hockey]] and [[roller hockey]]). If a goal is scored by the team opposite of the offender, then the offender may return to the field immediately. It is also used in the [[Clericus Cup]] association football league for a 5-minute bench penalty for unsportsmanlike play, and it is used in [[beach soccer]] for a 2-minute bench penalty for unsportsmanlike play.

Plans for the introduction of the blue card more widely were expected to be published by the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB), on 9 February 2024 but were delayed; {{Update span|the new protocols around the penalty are expected to be the subject of further discussion at IFAB's [[annual general meeting]] at [[Loch Lomond]] on 2 March 2024 and then published.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Simon |title=Blue cards for sin-binned players to be trialled by football's lawmakers Ifab |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/68246971 |website=[[BBC Sport]] |access-date=13 February 2024 |date=8 February 2024}}</ref>|date=September 2025}}

====Bandy====
A '''blue card''' is used in [[bandy]] to indicate a ten-minute timed penalty given to a player.<ref name="Bandywebsite"/> The offending player must leave the playing area and wait on a penalty bench near the centre line until the penalty has expired. During the 10 minute period the player may not be replaced. However, a different player may replace them when the penalty has expired. A blue card is typically shown for offences that are more serious than those warranting a white card including attacking an opponent in a violent or dangerous way, causing advantage by intentionally stopping the ball with a high stick or protesting a referee's decision.

====[[Handball]]====
The blue card has been in use in handball since the [[International Handball Federation]] announced a rule change that came into effect on July 1, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympichandball.org/2016/03/04/ihf-announces-rule-changes-effective-july-1st-2016/|title=IHF Announces Rule Changes Effective July 1st 2016 : Irish Olympic Handball Association|website=www.olympichandball.org|access-date=2017-01-18|archive-date=2017-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131040959/http://www.olympichandball.org/2016/03/04/ihf-announces-rule-changes-effective-july-1st-2016/|url-status=live}}</ref> First the Red Card is shown, then the referee will after a short discussion show the blue card. Following that a written report will accompany the score sheet and the Disciplinary Commission will then decide on further actions against the player.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cms.eurohandball.com/PortalData/1/Resources/1_ehf_main/3_download_pdf/Rule_changes_2016_03_01.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-01-18 |archive-date=2017-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119053052/http://cms.eurohandball.com/PortalData/1/Resources/1_ehf_main/3_download_pdf/Rule_changes_2016_03_01.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>
====[[Quidditch (sport)|Quidditch]]====
A blue card is also used in quidditch to indicate a technical foul. The fouling player is sent to the penalty box for one minute or until a goal is scored against the fouling player's team. Unlike a yellow card, there is no additional penalty for multiple blue cards.<ref name="quidditchrules" />
====Rugby union====
Under [[Rugby Australia]]'s Concussion Management Procedure, a blue card may be shown by the referee to a player, at "community" rugby level, who is suspected of suffering a potential concussion.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Report a Concern Concussion Management {{!}} Rugby Australia |url=https://australia.rugby/about/codes-and-policies/safety-and-welfare/concussion-management |access-date=2025-02-13 |website=australia.rugby |language=en}}</ref> This is a rare case of a "medical penalty", as any player who is shown a blue card is disqualified from rugby activity for a period of at least 12-19 days, depending on age and severity.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Australia |first=Rugby |title=CONCUSSION PROCEDURE (RUGBY PUBLIC – STANDARD CARE PATHWAY) |url=https://d26phqdbpt0w91.cloudfront.net/NonVideo/1ec5a184-03eb-4dc2-83d7-1b44e698cb6f.pdf |access-date=13 February 2025}}</ref>

The showing of the blue card triggers a detailed process aimed to prevent concussed players subsequent trauma, with a gradual return to training and matches outlined. The player must be replaced and cannot return, though this is generally considered a "free" replacement (where limited substitutions are permitted).
===Black card===
[[Image:Black card.svg|thumb|In [[fencing]], a black card indicates a permanent exclusion from the rest of the competition. In other sports alongside fencing black cards do such a similar job to red cards.]]

==== Badminton ====
A '''black''' card is used in the sport of badminton to indicate disqualification.<ref name=nyp>{{cite news | url=http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/olympics/badminton_players_tossed_match_olympic_28mGWBb3T9toHrGlBOCMFI | title=8 badminton players tossed from Olympic doubles after being accused of throwing matches | work=New York Post | date=1 August 2012 | agency=Associated Press | access-date=1 August 2012 | archive-date=3 August 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803205930/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/olympics/badminton_players_tossed_match_olympic_28mGWBb3T9toHrGlBOCMFI | url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Fencing ====
A black card is used in [[fencing]]. It is issued by the [[Tournament director|director]] or the referee for severe rule infractions.<ref name="Fencingrules"/> A second instance of a Group 3 offence, and all Group 4 offences including deliberate brutality, refusal to fence, refusal to salute, and refusal to shake hands can be punished with a black card.<ref name="Fencingrules"/> When the black card is issued, the offending fencer is excluded or eliminated from the remainder of the competition and may be suspended from further tournaments. In the official record of the tournament, their name is replaced with the words "FENCER EXCLUDED".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usfencing.org/usfa/content/view/1273/111/ |title=Fencing For Parents |access-date=2008-08-14 |work=U.S. Fencing – The Official Website of the U.S. Fencing Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625054519/http://www.usfencing.org/usfa/content/view/1273/111/ |archive-date=2008-06-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==== Gaelic games ====
In the [[Gaelic games]] of [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]], a ''tick'' or ''black book'' was formerly recorded against a player for a minor infringement not warranting a yellow card, though multiple bookings will result in the issuance of a yellow card. The act of the referee physically holding up his black notebook in the same manner as a card has been discontinued by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/gaa-throw-caution-to-wind-and-abandon-black-books-1732523.html|title=GAA throw caution to wind and abandon black books|newspaper=Irish Independent|first=Colm|last=Keys|date=May 8, 2009|access-date=August 20, 2010|archive-date=October 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024225420/http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/gaa-throw-caution-to-wind-and-abandon-black-books-1732523.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since 1 January 2014, a player in Gaelic football can be ordered off the pitch for the remainder of the game with a substitution allowed by being shown a black card (the referee's black notebook) in the same manner as any other penalty card for "cynical behaviour," including blatant tripping, pulling down and bodychecking. This forced substitution is an intermediate punishment between the yellow and red cards. A player who receives a yellow card and a black card in the same game is sent off without any substitute being permitted.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/gaa-pass-controversial-black-card-rule-29150028.html|date=23 March 2013|access-date=14 August 2013|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|title=GAA passcontroversial 'black card' rule|archive-date=17 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017103808/http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/gaa-pass-controversial-black-card-rule-29150028.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

As of January 2020, a player who receives a black card is ejected from the field to a penalty box for a period of ten minutes. The player may return to the field after this period has elapsed, during a break in play with the permission of the referee. If a match extends into extra time and the player has not been in the penalty box for ten minutes, they must serve any remaining time before rejoining play. As in previous years, a player who receives both a yellow card and a black card or two black cards is then shown a red card and ejected for the remainder of the match and cannot be replaced.<ref>{{cite web |title=Guide to new the Gaelic Football playing rules |url=https://www.gaa.ie/football/news/guide-to-new-the-gaelic-football-playing-rules/ |website=GAA.ie |date=23 January 2020 |publisher=Gaelic Athletic Association |access-date=20 November 2020 |archive-date=20 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210120230952/https://www.gaa.ie/football/news/guide-to-new-the-gaelic-football-playing-rules/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
