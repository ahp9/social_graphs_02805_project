In [[association football]], '''expected goals''' ('''xG''') is a [[performance metric]] used to evaluate team and player performances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://understat.com/|title=xG stats for teams and players from the TOP European leagues|website=understat.com}}</ref> It can be used to represent the probability of a scoring opportunity that may result in a [[Scoring in association football|goal]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Expected goals in soccer|url=https://research.tue.nl/en/studentTheses/expected-goals-in-soccer|access-date=2020-09-27|website=Eindhoven University of Technology research portal|language=en}}</ref> It is also used in [[ice hockey]].<ref name="Ryder2007"/><ref name="NHL"/><ref name="comparing-NHL-models">{{cite news |last1=Goldman |first1=Shayna |title=Comparing public expected goal models: How they work and what we should take away from them |work=The New York Times |date=9 December 2021 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3006028/2021/12/09/comparing-public-expected-goal-models-how-they-work-and-what-we-should-take-away-from-them/ |access-date=30 April 2024 |language=en}}</ref>

==Meaning==
The expected goals metric is generally calculated by determining the likelihood of a shot being scored based on various factors, taken from the moment before the player shoots. These factors may vary depending on the statistical model, but include the distance to the goal, angle, shot type, and other contextual factors. Each shot is then given a probabilistic value, representing how many times that shot is likely to be scored based on similar shots. For example, a shot with a value of 0.3 goals is likely to be scored about 3 out of every 10 times.<ref name="Football-glossary">{{cite news |last1=Carey |first1=Mark |last2=Worville |first2=Tom |title=The Athletic's football analytics glossary: explaining xG, PPDA, field tilt and how to use them |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/2730755/2021/07/28/the-athletics-football-analytics-glossary-explaining-xg-ppda-field-tilt-and-how-to-use-them/ |access-date=30 April 2024 |language=en}}</ref> The expected goals metric has become more common with the increase of data analytics in sports, as analysts based the metric on accumulated years of sports data.<ref name="Toronto-FC-xg">{{cite news |last1=Kloke |first1=Joshua |title=Understanding expected goals and how they impact Toronto FC |work=The New York Times |date=16 June 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/67687/2017/06/16/understanding-expected-goals-and-how-they-impact-toronto-fc/ |access-date=30 April 2024 |language=en}}</ref>

==History and application of xG==

There is some debate about the origin of the term ''expected goals''. Vic Barnett and his colleague Sarah Hilditch referred to "expected goals" in their 1993 paper that investigated the effects of [[Artificial turf|artificial pitch (AP)]] surfaces on home team performance in association football in England.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Barnett |first1=Vic |last2=Hilditch |first2=S |date=1993 |title= The Effect of an Artificial Pitch Surface on Home Team Performance in Football (Soccer) |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series A (Statistics in Society) |volume=156 |issue=1 |pages=39–50 |doi=10.2307/2982859|jstor=2982859 }}</ref> Their paper included this observation:
<blockquote>
Quantitatively we find for the AP group about 0.15 more [[scoring in association football|goals]] per home match than expected and, allowing for the lower than expected goals against in home matches, an excess goal difference (for home matches) of about 0.31 goals per home match. Over a season this yields about 3 more goals for, an improved goal difference of about 6 goals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Barnett |first1=Vic |last2=Hilditch |first2=S |date=1993 |title= The Effect of an Artificial Pitch Surface on Home Team Performance in Football (Soccer) |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Jake Ensum, Richard Pollard and Samuel Taylor (2004) reported their study of data from 37 matches in the [[2002 World Cup]] in which 930 shots and 93 goals were recorded.<ref name="applications">{{cite journal |last1=Ensum |first1=Jake|last2=Pollard |first2=Richard |last3=Taylor |first3=Samuel |date=2004 |title=Applications of logistic regression to shots at goal in association football: calculation of shot probabilities, quantification of factors and player/team |journal=Journal of Sports Sciences |volume=22 |issue=6 |page=504 }}</ref> Their research sought "to investigate and quantify 12 factors that might affect the success of a shot". Their [[logistic regression]] identified five factors that had a [[Statistical significance|significant]] effect on determining the success of a kicked shot: distance from the goal; angle from the goal; whether or not the player taking the shot was at least 1 m away from the nearest defender; whether or not the shot was immediately preceded by a [[Cross (association football)|cross]]; and the number of outfield players between the shot-taker and goal.<ref name="applications"/> They concluded "the calculation of shot [[probabilities]] allows a greater depth of analysis of shooting opportunities in comparison to recording only the number of shots".<ref name="applications"/> In a subsequent paper (2004), Ensum, Pollard and Taylor combined data from the [[1986 World Cup|1986]] and 2002 World Cup competitions to identify three significant factors that determined the success of a kicked shot: distance from the goal; angle from the goal; and whether or not the player taking the shot was at least 1 m away from the nearest defender.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pollard |first1=Richard|last2=Ensum |first2=Jake |last3=Taylor |first3=Samuel |date=2004 |title= Estimating the probability of a shot resulting in a goal: The effects of distance, angle and space |journal=International Journal of Soccer and Science |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=50–55 }}</ref> More recent studies have identified similar factors as relevant for xG metrics.<ref>{{cite web |title=An examination of expected goals and shot efficiency in soccer |url=https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/3010/301052437005.pdf |publisher=Universidad de Alicante}}</ref>

Howard Hamilton (2009) proposed "a useful statistic in soccer" that "will ultimately contribute to what I call an 'expected goal value' — for any action on the field in the course of a game, the probability that said action will create a goal".<ref>{{cite web |author=Hamilton, Howard|title=Moneyball and soccer|url=http://www.soccermetrics.net/high-level-discussions/moneyball-and-soccer-2| date=8 January 2009 |accessdate=6 February 2018 }}</ref>

Sander Itjsma (2011) discussed "a method to assign different value to different chances created during a football match" and in doing so concluded:<ref name="chance">{{cite web |author=Itjsma, Sander|title=A chance is a chance is a chance? |url=http://11tegen11.net/2011/07/13/a-chance-is-a-chance-is-a-chance/| date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=4 January 2018 }}</ref>
<blockquote>
we now have a system in place in order to estimate the overall value of the chances created by either team during the match. Knowing how many goals a team is expected to score from its chances is of much more value than just knowing how many attempts to score a goal were made. Other applications of this method of evaluation would be to distinguish a lack of quality attempts created from a finishing problem or to evaluate defensive and goalkeeping performances. And a third option would be to plot the balance of play during the match in terms of the quality of chances created in order to graphically represent how the balance of play evolved during the match.<ref name="chance"/>

[[Sarah Rudd]] (2011) discussed probable goal scoring patterns (P(Goal)) in her use of [[Markov chain]]s for tactical analysis (including the proximity of defenders) from 123 games in the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010-2011 English Premier League season]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Rudd, Sarah|author-link=Sarah Rudd|title=A Framework for Tactical Analysis and Individual Offensive Production Assessment in Soccer Using Markov Chains|url=https://nessis.org/nessis11/rudd.pdf |date=24 September 2011 |accessdate=7 February 2018 }}</ref> In a video presentation of her paper at the 2011 New England Symposium of Statistics in Sport, Rudd reported her use of analysis methods to compare "expected goals" with actual goals and her process of applying weightings to incremental actions for P(goal) outcomes.<ref>{{YouTube|-CbLoQVzC-4|title=2011 NESSIS - Talk by Sarah Rudd}}</ref>

In April 2012, Sam Green wrote about 'expected goals' in his assessment of [[Premier League]] goalscorers.<ref name="auto3">{{cite web |author=Green, Sam|title=Assessing the performance of Premier League goalscorers |url=http://www.optasportspro.com/about/optapro-blog/posts/2012/blog-assessing-the-performance-of-premier-league-goalscorers/| date=12 April 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2018 }}</ref> He asked "So how do we quantify which areas of the pitch are the most likely to result in a goal and therefore, which shots have the highest probability of resulting in a goal?". He added: 
<blockquote>
If we can establish this metric, we can then accurately and effectively increase our chances of scoring and therefore winning matches. Similarly, we can use this data from a defensive perspective to limit the better chances by defending key areas of the pitch.<ref name="auto3"/>
</blockquote>

Green proposed a model to determine "a shot's probability of being on target and/or scored". With this model "we can look at each player's shots and tally up the probability of each of them being a goal to give an expected goal (xG) value".<ref name="auto3"/>

===Ice hockey===
In 2004, Alan Ryder shared a methodology for the study of the quality of an [[ice hockey]] [[shot on goal (ice hockey)|shot on goal]]. His discussion started with this sentence “Not all shots on goal are created equal”.<ref name="Ryder2004">{{cite web |author=Ryder, Alan|title=Shot quality |url=http://hockeyanalytics.com/Research_files/Shot_Quality.pdf| date=January 2004 |page=2 |accessdate=4 January 2018 }}</ref> Ryder's model for the measurement of shot quality was:
<blockquote>
* Collect the data and analyze [[goal (ice hockey)|goal]] probabilities for each shooting circumstance
* Build a model of goal probabilities that relies on the measured circumstance
* For each shot, determine its goal probability
* Expected Goals: EG = the sum of the goal probabilities for each shot
* Neutralize the variation in shots on goal by calculating Normalized Expected Goals
* Shot Quality Against
</blockquote>

Ryder concluded:
<blockquote>
The model to get to expected goals given the shot quality factors is simply based on the
data. There are no meaningful assumptions made. The analytic methods are the classics
from statistics and actuarial science. The results are therefore very credible.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ryder, Alan|title=Shot quality |url=http://hockeyanalytics.com/Research_files/Shot_Quality.pdf| date=January 2004 |page=15 |accessdate=5 January 2018 }}</ref>
</blockquote>

In 2007,<ref name="Ryder2007">{{cite web |author=Ryder, Alan|title=Product Recall Notice for 'Shot Quality' |url=http://hockeyanalytics.com/Research_files/Product_Recall_for_Shot_Quality.pdf| date=2007 |accessdate=5 January 2018 }}</ref> Ryder issued a product recall notice for his shot quality model. He presented “a cautionary note on the calculation of shot quality” and pointed to “data quality problems with the measurement of the quality of a hockey team’s shots taken and allowed”.<ref name="Ryder2007"/>

He reported:
<blockquote>
I have been worried that there is a systemic bias in the data. Random errors don’t concern me. They even out over large volumes of data. But I do think that ... the scoring in certain rinks has a bias towards longer or shorter shots, the most dominant factor in a shot quality model. And I set out to investigate that possibility.<ref name="Ryder2007"/></blockquote>

The term 'expected goals' appeared in a paper about ice hockey performance presented by Brian Macdonald<ref name="NHL">{{cite web |author=Macdonald, Brian|title=An Expected Goals Model for Evaluating NHL Teams and Players |url=http://www.hockeyanalytics.com/Research_files/NHL-Expected-Goals-Brian-Macdonald.pdf| date=March 2012 |accessdate=3 January 2018 }}</ref> at the [[MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference]] in 2012. Macdonald's method for calculating expected goals was reported in the paper:
<blockquote>
We used data from the last four full [[NHL]] seasons. For each team, the season was split into two halves. Since midseason trades and injuries can have an impact on a team’s performance, we did not use statistics from the first half of the season to predict goals in the second half. Instead, we split the season into odd and even games, and used statistics from odd games to predict goals in even games. Data from [[2007-08 NHL season|2007-08]], [[2008-09 NHL season|2008-09]], and [[2009-10 NHL season|2009-10]] was used as the training data to estimate the parameters in the model, and data from the entire [[2010-11 NHL season|2010-11]] was set aside for validating the model. The model was also validated using 10-fold cross-validation. Mean squared error (MSE) of actual goals and predicted goals was our choice for measuring the performance of our models.<ref name="NHL"/>

==Expected assists (xA)==
In association football, expected assists (xA) measures the likelihood that a completed pass becomes a [[Assist (association football)|goal assist]], factoring in distance and the type of pass.<ref>https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12829539/expected-goals-expected-assists-pressures-carries-high-turnovers-and-more-advanced-stats-explained</ref>
