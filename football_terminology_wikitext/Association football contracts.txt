'''Association football  contracts''' are the legal contracts for both amateur and professional [[association football|football]]. Football contracts overlaps substantially with [[contract]], [[tort]] and [[labour law]]. Issues like [[defamation]], [[Privacy|privacy rights]] and [[intellectual property law]] are also an integral aspect of football contracts. This area has been subject to a number of controversies since the 1990s (see the [[Bosman ruling]] and the [[Webster ruling]]). These cases have coincided with the rebalancing of player power and increased media scrutiny and commercialisation of football.
