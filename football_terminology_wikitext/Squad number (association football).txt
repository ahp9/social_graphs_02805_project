'''Squad numbers''' are used in [[association football]] to identify and distinguish players who are on the field. [[number (sports)|Numbers]] very soon became a way to also indicate position, with starting players being assigned numbers 1–11. However, there is no fixed rule; numbers may be assigned to indicate position, alphabetically by name, according to a player's whim, randomly, or in any other way. In the modern game they are often influenced by the players' favourite numbers and other less technical reasons, as well as using "surrogates" for a number that is already in use. However, numbers 1–11 are often still worn by players of the previously associated position.<ref name=sports.yahoo.com>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/mystery-solved--why-do-the-best-soccer-players-wear-no--10-052229677.html|title=Mystery solved: Why do the best soccer players wear No. 10?|publisher=Yahoo|author1=Khalil Garriot|date=21 June 2014|access-date=19 May 2015}}</ref>

As national leagues adopted squad numbers and game tactics evolved over the decades, numbering systems evolved separately in each football scene, and so different countries have different conventions. Still, there are some numbers that are universally agreed upon being used for a particular position, because they are quintessentially associated with that role.<ref name=sports.yahoo.com/>

For instance, "1" is frequently used by the starting [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], as the goalkeeper is the first player in a line-up.<ref name=sports.yahoo.com/> "9" is usually worn by [[Forward (association football)#Striker|strikers]], also known as [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre-forwards]], who hold the most advanced offensive position on the pitch, and are often the highest scorers in the team.<ref name=sports.yahoo.com/> "10" is one of the most emblematic squad numbers in football,<ref name=emblematica/> due to the sheer number of football legends that have worn the number 10 shirt; [[playmaker]]s, [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]]s, and [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]]s have worn this number.<ref name=sports.yahoo.com/>

==History==
===First use of numbers===
The first record of numbered jerseys in football date back to 1911, with Australian teams Sydney Leichardt and HMS Powerful being the first to use squad numbers on their backs.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6EQC4vTUpGAC&dq=squad+numbers+australia+1911+football&pg=PA8 ''The Secret Lives of Numbers: The Curious Truth Behind Everyday Digits''] by Michael Millar, Virgin Books, 2012 – {{ISBN|978-0753540862}}</ref> One year later, numbering in football would be ruled as mandatory in [[New South Wales]].<ref>[https://mundod.lavoz.com.ar/node/624034 Así nació la tradición de usar números en las camisetas] by Gustavo Farías on ''La Voz del Interior'', 22 August 2013</ref>

The next recorded use was on 23 March 1914 when the English Wanderers, a team of amateur players from [[English Football League|Football League]] clubs, played [[Corinthian F.C.|Corinthians]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], London. This was Corinthians' first match after their [[Amateur Football Alliance#History|FA ban for joining the Amateur Football Association]] was rescinded. Wanderers won 4–2.<ref name="PlayUp">{{cite book |last= Cavallini |first= Rob | title= Play Up Corinth: A History of The Corinthian Football Club |year= 2007 |page=114 |publisher= History Press Limited |isbn=978-0-7524-4479-6 }}</ref>

[[File:Combinado znorte v third lamark 10jun1923.jpg|thumb|First use of numbers in South America: [[Third Lanark A.C.|Third Lanark]] and Argentine "Zona Norte" combined entering to the pitch with numbered jerseys, 10 June 1923]]
In South America, Argentina was the first country with numbered shirts. It was during the Scottish team [[Third Lanark A.C.|Third Lanark]] [[British football clubs tours to South America#Third Lanark|tour to South America of 1923]], they played a friendly match v a local combined team ("Zona Norte") on 10 June. Both squads were numbered from 1–11.<ref name=emblematica>[https://www.pagina12.com.ar/93048-el-numero-10-la-camiseta-que-se-convirtio-en-un-emblema El número 10, la camiseta que se convirtió en un emblema] by Leonardo Peluso on ''Página/12'', 3 February 2018</ref>

On 30 March 1924, saw the first football match in the [[soccer in the United States|United States]] with squad numbers, when the [[Fall River F.C. (1922–1931)|Fall River F.C.]] played [[St. Louis Vesper Buick]] during the [[1923–24 National Challenge Cup]], although only the local team wore numbered shirts.<ref name=clarin>[https://www.clarin.com/deportes/historia-curiosidades-numeracion-fija-futbol_0_B1-ObAB9Z.html Historia y curiosidades de la numeración fija en el fútbol] by Walter Raiño on ''Clarín'', 13 September 2017</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6zdZqbAFpE |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211215/E6zdZqbAFpE |archive-date=2021-12-15 |url-status=live|title=1924 U.S. Open Cup Final Fall River @ Vesper Buick (St. Louis)|last=soccermavn|date=16 December 2012|access-date=4 April 2018|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

The next recorded use in association football in Europe was on 25 August 1928 when [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]] played [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]<ref>[http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-wear-numbered-shirts "Gunners wear numbered shirts"], Arsenal.com, 6 July 2007</ref> and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] hosted [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea Town]] at Stamford Bridge. Numbers were assigned by field location:

#[[Goalkeeper (association football)|Goalkeeper]]
#[[Fullback (association football)|Right full back]] (right side centre back)
#[[Fullback (association football)|Left full back]] (left side centre back)
#[[Wing half|Right half back]] (right side defensive midfield)
#[[Centre half]] back (centre defensive midfield)
#[[Wing half|Left half back]] (left side defensive midfield)
#[[Outside forward|Outside right]] (right winger)
#[[Inside forward|Inside right]] (attacking midfield)
#[[Centre forward]]
#[[Inside forward|Inside left]] (attacking midfield)
#[[Outside forward|Outside left]] (left winger)

In the first game at Stamford Bridge, only the outfield players wore numbers (2–11). ''[[The Daily Express]]'' (p.&nbsp;13, 27 August 1928) reported, "The 35,000 spectators were able to give credit for each bit of good work to the correct individual, because the team were numbered, and the large figures in black on white squares enabled each man to be identified without trouble." ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' ("Numbered Jerseys A Success", p.&nbsp;29, 27 August 1928) also covered the match: "I fancy the scheme has come to stay. All that was required was a lead and London has supplied it." When Chelsea toured Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil at the end of the season in the summer of 1929, they also wore numbered shirts, earning the nickname "''Los Numerados''" ("the numbered") from locals.

[[File:Arsenal fc wear numbered shirts 1933.jpg|thumb|Arsenal FC wearing numbered shirts in a friendly v FC Vienna in 1933. Numbered shirts had first appeared in England in 1928 when Arsenal played Sheffield Wednesday. Their use would not be ruled mandatory until 1939]]
A similar numbering criterion was used in the [[1933 FA Cup Final]] between [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].<ref name=histboys/> Nevertheless, it was not until the [[1939–40 Football League|1939–40]] season when [[English Football League|The Football League]] ruled that squads had to wear numbers for each player.<ref name=histboys>[https://www.thefootballhistoryboys.com/2020/04/the-most-novel-cup-final-in-history-of.html The 'most novel cup final in the history of football'] By Gareth Thomas on The Football History Boys - April 14, 2020</ref><ref name=clarin/>

Early evolutions of formations involved moving specific positions; for example, moving the centre half back to become a defender rather than a half back. Their numbers went with them, hence central defenders wearing number 5, and remnants of the system remain. For example, in friendly and championship qualifying matches [[England national football team|England]], when playing the 4–4–2 formation, generally number their players (using the standard right to left system of listing football teams) four defenders – 2, 5, 6, 3; four midfielders – 7, 4, 8, 11; two forwards – 10, 9. This system of numbering can also be adapted to a midfield diamond with the holding midfielder wearing 4 and the attacking central midfielder wearing 8. Similarly, the Swedish national team number their players: four defenders – 2, 3, 4, 5; four midfielders – 7, 6, 8, 9; two forwards – 10, 11.

The [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] was the first [[FIFA]] competition to see squad numbers for each players,<ref>[https://www.marca.com/reportajes/2010/02/brasil_1950/2010/02/18/seccion_01/1266495739.html De 'Nuestro Hirosima' al surgimiento de los números como dorsales] by Javier Estepa on Marca</ref> but persistent numbers would not be issued until the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]], where each man in a country's 22-man squad wore a specific number from 1 to 22 for the duration of the tournament.

===Evolution===
In 1993, [[The Football Association]] (The FA) switched to persistent squad numbers, abandoning the mandatory use of 1–11 for the starting line-up. The first league event to feature this was the [[1993 Football League Cup Final]] between Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday, and it became standard in the [[Premier League|FA Premier League]] the following season, along with names printed above the numbers.<ref name=clarin/> [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] were among the ten Football League clubs who chose to adopt squad numbers for the 1993–94 season (with squad numbers assigned to players in alphabetical order according to their surname), before reverting to 1–11 shirt numbering a year later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://squadnumbers.wordpress.com/2014/10/14/1-11-in-the-premier-league-era/|title=1–11 in the Premier League era|date=14 October 2014|website=wordpress.com|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref>

Squad numbers became optional in the three divisions of the [[English Football League|Football League]] at the same time, but only 10 out of 70 clubs used them. One of those clubs, [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], issued 25 players with squad numbers but reverted to traditional 1–11 numbering halfway through the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thegoldstonewrap.com/tag/ron-pavey/|title=ron pavey – The Goldstone Wrap|website=thegoldstonewrap.com|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> In the Premier League, Arsenal temporarily reverted to the old system halfway through that same season, but reverted to the new numbering system for the following campaign. Most European top leagues adopted the system during the 1990s.<ref name=clarin/> The Football League made squad numbers compulsory for the [[1999–2000 in English football|1999–2000 season]], and the [[Football Conference]] followed suit for the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03 season]].

The traditional 1–11 numbers have been worn on occasions by English clubs since their respective leagues introduced squad numbers. Premier League clubs often used the traditional squad numbering system when competing in domestic or European cups, often when their opponents still made use of the traditional squad numbering system. This included [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s Premier League clash with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] at [[Old Trafford]] on 10 February 2008, when 1950s style kits were worn as part of the [[Munich air disaster]]'s 50th anniversary commemorations.

Players may now wear any number, as long as it is unique within their squad, between 1 and 99.

In continental Western Europe this can generally be seen:

# Goalkeeper
# Right Back
# Left Back
# Central Defensive/Holding Midfielder
# Centre Back (or [[Sweeper (association football)|Sweeper]], if used)
# Centre Back
# Right Attacking Midfielder/Winger
# Central/Box-to-Box Midfielder
# Striker
# Attacking Midfielder/Playmaker
# Left Attacking Midfielder/Winger

This changes from formation to formation, although the defensive number placement generally remains the same. The use of [[Midfielder#Inverted winger and raumdeuter|inverted winger]]s now sees traditional right wingers (the number 7s, like [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]) on the left and traditional left wingers (the number 11s, like [[Gareth Bale]]) on the right.

==Numbering by country==

===Argentina===
[[File:Lionel Messi 2018.jpg|thumb|[[Lionel Messi]] displaying his squad number (10), as portrayed on his [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] jersey in 2018]]
Argentina developed its numeration system independently from the rest of the world. This was because until the 1960s, Argentine football developed more or less isolated from the evolution brought by English, Italian and Hungarian coaches, owing to technological limitations at the time in communications and travelling with Europe, lack of information as to keeping up with news, lack of awareness and/or interest in the latest innovations, and strong nationalism promoted by the [[Asociación del Fútbol Argentino]] (for example, back then Argentines playing in Europe were banned from playing in the Argentine national team).

The first formation used in Argentine football was the '''2–3–5''' and, until the 1960s, it was the sole formation employed by Argentine clubs and the [[Argentina national football team]], with only very few exceptions like [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]]'s ''La Máquina'' from the 1940s that used '''3–2–2–3'''. It was not until the mid 1960s in the national team, with Argentina winning the [[Taça das Nações]] (1964) using '''3–2–5''', and the late 1960s, for clubs, with [[Club Estudiantes de La Plata|Estudiantes]] winning the treble of the [[Copa Libertadores]] (1968, 1969, 1970) using '''4–4–2''', that Argentine football adopted European formations on major scale, and mirrored its counterparts on the other side of the Atlantic.

While the original '''2–3–5''' formation used the same numbering system dictated by the English clubs in 1928, subsequent changes were developed independently.

The basic formation to understand the Argentine numbering system is the '''4–3–3''' formation, used by the coach [[César Menotti]] for the team that won the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]]. The squad numbers are:

* 1 Goalkeeper
* 4 Right Back<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/blog_detalle.php?id_post=646%7CSalvemos|title=Salvemos al 4: la desaparición de los laterales|website=www.elgrafico.com.ar|access-date=4 April 2018}} {{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
* 2 First Centre Back / Sweeper
* 6 Second Centre Back / Stopper
* 3 Left Back<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infobae.com/2007/08/24/333633-el-lateral-izquierdo-una-especie-extincion%7cEl|title=lateral izquierdo, ¿una especie en extinción?|website=infobae.com|access-date=4 April 2018}}{{Dead link|date=August 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
* 8 Right Midfielder
* 5 Central Defensive Midfielder<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dejatodoodejaelfutbol.obolog.es/numero-5-volante-tapon-mediocampista-central-284902%7cEl|title=número 5: Volante tapón-mediocampista central|website=obolog.es|access-date=4 April 2018}} {{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
* 10 Left Midfielder
* 7 Right Winger
* 11 Left Winger
* 9 Striker

=== Brazil ===

In Brazil, the 4–2–4 formation was developed independently from Europe, thus leading to a different numbering – here shown in the 4–3–3 formation to stress that in Brazil, number ten is midfield:

*1 Goleiro (Goalkeeper)
*2 Lateral Direito (right wingback)
*3 Zagueiro Direito (right centre back) or Beque Central (centre back) "STOPPER"
*4 Zagueiro Esquerdo (left centre back) or Quarto Zagueiro (the "Quarterback", almost the same as a centre back) "SWEEPER"
*6 Lateral Esquerdo (left wingback)
*5 Primeiro Volante ("Rudder" or "mobile", the defensive midfielder)
*8 Segundo Volante (central midfielder) or Meia Armador (playmaker)
*10 Meia Atacante (attacking midfielder) or Meia Esquerda (left midfielder, generally more offensive than the right one)
*7 Ponta Direita (right winger) or Meia Direita (right midfielder)
*9 Centroavante (centre-forward/striker)
*11 Ponta Esquerda (left winger) or Segundo Atacante (secondary striker)

When in 4–2–4, number 10 passes to the Ponta de Lança (striker), and 4–4–2 formations get this configuration: four defenders – 2 (right wingback), 4, 3, 6 (left wingback); four midfielders – 5 (defensive), 8 ("second midfielder"), similar to a central midfielder), 7, 10 (attacking); two strikers – 9, 11

===France===
Until 2022, players were required to be registered between numbers 1–30, with 1 and 16 reserved for goalkeepers and 33 left empty for extra signings. If a further goalkeeper had to be registered, they were allocated the number 40.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.balls.ie/football/mario-balotelli-nice-jersey-squad-number-rule-345995|title=Hate Mental Squad Numbers? You'll Love Ligue 1's Reasoning For Not Letting Balotelli Wear #45|first=Mikey|last=Traynor|website=balls.ie|date=12 September 2016 |access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> Since the [[2022–23 Ligue 1]] season, players may now wear any number between 1 and 99 without restriction.

=== Hungary ===
In Eastern Europe, the defence numbering is slightly different. The [[Hungary national football team|Hungarian national team]] under [[Gusztáv Sebes]] switched from a 2–3–5 formation to 3–2–5. So the defence numbers were 2 to 4 from right to left thus making the right back (2), centre back (3) and the left back (4). Since the concept of a flat back four the number (5) has become the other centre back.

===Italy===
In 1995, the [[Italian Football Federation]] (FIGC) also switched to persistent squad numbers for [[Serie A]] and [[Serie B]] (second division), abandoning the mandatory use of 1–11 for the starting lineup. After some years during which players had to wear a number between 1–24, now they can wear any number between 1–99 without restrictions. Notably, [[Chievo Verona]] had the goalkeeper [[Cristiano Lupatelli]] wearing number 10 from 2001 to 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/25759/no-10-shirt-downsized|title=No 10 shirt downsized – Football Italia|website=www.football-italia.net|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> and midfielder [[Jonathan de Guzman]] wearing number 1 in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/2942637/jonathan-de-guzman-to-wear-no-1-at-chievo|title=Jonathan De Guzman to wear the No.1 shirt at Chievo|website=espnfc.com|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref>

FIGC banned the use of the number [[88 (number)|88]] on kits in 2023 due to its [[anti-semitic]] connections; the announcement was made following several instances of neo-Nazi fans using the number.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Rasmussen |first=Karl |date=27 June 2023 |title=Italy Bans Soccer Jersey Number Due to Antisemitic Connotation |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2023/06/27/italy-bans-soccer-jersey-number-antisemitic-connotation-88 |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=27 June 2023}}</ref>

===Spain===
In the Spanish [[La Liga]], players in the A-squad (maximum 25 players, including a maximum of three [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]]) must wear a number between 1–25. Goalkeepers must wear 1, 13 or 25. When players from the reserve team are selected to play for the first team, they are given squad numbers between 26 and 50.

===United Kingdom===
Players are not generally allowed to change their number during a season, although a player may change number if they change clubs mid-season. Players may change squad numbers between seasons; this often happens when a player's role in the first team increases or diminishes. Occasionally, when a player has two loan spells at the same club in a single season (or returns as a permanent signing after an earlier loan), an alternative number is needed if the original number has been reassigned.

A move from a high number to a low one may be an indication that the player is likely to be a regular starter for the coming season, particularly after at least one preceding season of increased first team opportunities. An example is [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]'s [[Scott McDonald]], who, after the departure of former number 7 [[Maciej Żurawski]], was given the number, a move down from 27.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.celticfc.net/news/stories/news_100708165942.aspx |title=New squad numbers for title heroes |access-date=14 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917133824/http://celticfc.net/news/stories/news_100708165942.aspx |archive-date=17 September 2008 }}</ref> Another example is [[Steven Gerrard]], who wore number 28 (his number in the academy) during his debut [[1998–99 Liverpool F.C. season#Squad|1998–99 season]], then switched to 17 in [[2000–01 Liverpool F.C. season#First-team squad|2000–01]]. In [[2004–05 Liverpool F.C. season#First-team squad|2004–05]], after [[Emile Heskey]] left Liverpool, Gerrard then changed his number again to 8. [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] striker [[Harry Kane]] changed his number from 37 for the [[2013–14 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season#First-team squad|2013–14 season]] to 18 for the [[2014–15 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2014–15 season]] when he became one of the club's first-choice strikers after [[Jermain Defoe]] was sold and the number 18 was vacated. Kane then switched to the number 10 for the [[2015–16 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2015–16 season]] after [[Emmanuel Adebayor]] left the club and the number was vacated. Manchester City's [[Sergio Agüero]] also did a similar switch in shirt number, from number 16 in [[2014–15 Manchester City F.C. season|2014–15]] to number 10 in [[2015–16 Manchester City F.C. season|2015–16]], a number he took over from [[Edin Džeko]] following his loan departure to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. During the 1990s, [[David Beckham]] wore a different shirt number for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in four consecutive seasons. He was assigned the number 28 shirt for the 1993–94 season and retained it for the 1994–95 season, before switching to the number 24 shirt for the 1995–96 season, when he established himself as a regular player. He then switched to the number 10 shirt for the 1996–97 season, and following the retirement of [[Eric Cantona]] at the end of that season, he switched to the number 7 shirt for the 1997–98 season, with new signing [[Teddy Sheringham]] taking the number 10 shirt.

Some players keep the number they start their career at a club with, such as Chelsea defender [[John Terry]], who wore the number 26 during his long spell at the club. On occasion, players have moved numbers to accommodate a new player; for example, Chelsea midfielder [[Yossi Benayoun]] handed new signing [[Juan Mata]] the number 10 shirt, and changed to the number 30, which doubles his "lucky" number 15, or when [[Edinson Cavani]] had to swap his number 7 for 21 after the arrival of [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 2021.<ref name="Deco's Top 20">{{cite news

In a traditional 4–4–2 system in the UK, the squad numbers 1–11 would usually have been:

* 1 Goalkeeper
* 2 Right-back
* 3 Left-back
* 4 Central midfielder (more defensive)
* 5 Centre back
* 6 Centre back
* 7 Right winger
* 8 Central midfielder (more attacking/box-to-box)
* 9 Striker (usually a target player)
* 10 Second striker (usually a fast poacher)
* 11 Left winger

However, even before the introduction of squad numbers in 1993, there were many exceptions to this rule. For example, at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], the number 7 was typically associated with the team's attacking midfielder or second striker ([[Kevin Keegan]], [[Kenny Dalglish]], [[Peter Beardsley]]).

In a more modern 4–2–3–1 system, the numbering will typically be arranged like this:

* 1 Goalkeeper
* 2 Right-back
* 3 Left-back
* 4 Central midfielder (more defensive)
* 5 Centre-back
* 6 Centre-back
* 7 Right winger
* 8 Central midfielder (box-to-box)
* 9 Striker
* 10 Central midfielder (more attacking)

Higher-level clubs have a tendency to field reserve and fringe players in the [[EFL Cup]], as well as [[dead rubber]] matches towards the end of the season, so high squad numbers are not uncommon.

==== England ====
[[File:Formation evolution.jpg|thumb|Evolution from 2–3–5 to 4–4–2]]
In England, in a now traditional 4–4–2 formation, the standard numbering is usually: 2 (right fullback), 5 and 6 (centre backs), 3 (left fullback); 4 (defensive midfielder), 7 (right midfielder), 8 (central/attacking midfielder), 11 (left midfielder); 10 (second/support striker), 9 (striker). This came about based on the traditional 2–3–5 system. Where the 2 fullbacks retained the numbers 2, 3. Then of the halves, 4 was kept as the central defensive midfielder, while 5 and 6 were moved backward to be in the central of defence. 7 and 11 stayed as the wide attacking players, whilst 8 dropped back a little from inside forward to a (sometimes attacking) midfield role, and 10 stayed as a second striker in support of a number 9. The 4 is generally the holding midfielder, as through the formation evolution it was often used for the sweeper or libero position. This position defended behind the central defenders, but attacked in front – feeding the midfield. It is generally not used today, and developed into the holding midfielder role.

When [[Substitute (association football)|substitutions]] were introduced to the game in 1965, the substitute typically took the number 12; when a second substitute was allowed, they wore 14. Players were not compelled to wear the number [[13 (number)|13]] if they were [[Triskaidekaphobia|superstitious]].

===United States and Canada===
North American professional association football club follows a model similar to that of European clubs, with the exception that many American and Canadian clubs do not have "reserve squads", and thus do not assign higher numbers to those players.

Most American and Canadian clubs have players numbered from 1 to 30, with higher numbers being reserved for second and third goalkeepers. In the [[USL First Division]] (since merged into the current [[USL Championship]]) and [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS), there were only 20 outfield players wearing squad numbers higher than 30 on the first team in the 2009 season, suggesting that the traditional model has been followed.

In 2007, MLS club [[LA Galaxy]] retired the former playing number of [[Cobi Jones]], number 13, becoming the first MLS team to do so. Jones allowed [[Jermaine Jones]] to wear the number in 2017.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.lagalaxy.com/news/cobi-jones-confirms-jermaine-jones-will-wear-la-galaxy-no-13-kit-insider |title=Cobi Jones confirms that Jermaine Jones will wear the LA Galaxy No. 13 kit |date=7 February 2017 |access-date=21 July 2023 |publisher=[[LA Galaxy]] |first=Adam |last=Serrano}}</ref>

==Goalkeeper numbering==
[[File:Hope in San Jose.jpg|thumb|[[Hope Solo]] displaying her squad number (1), as portrayed on her [[United States women's national soccer team|US national team]] jersey]]
The first-choice goalkeeper is usually assigned the number 1 shirt as they are the first player in a line-up.<ref name=sports.yahoo.com/>

The second-choice goalkeeper wears, on many occasions, shirt number 12, which is the first shirt of the second line up, or number 13. In the past, when it was permitted to assign five substitute players in a match, the goalkeeper would also often wear the number 16, the last shirt number in the squad. Later on, when association football laws changed and it was permitted to assign seven substitute players, second-choice goalkeepers often wore the number 18. In [[A-League Men]], second-choice goalkeepers mostly wear number 20, based on that competition having a 20-man regulated "first team" squad size.

In international tournaments (such as FIFA World Cup or continental cups) each team must list a squad of 26 players,{{Update inline|date=April 2023|reason=the standard international squad is 26 players since 2021}} wearing shirts numbered 1 through 26. Thus, in this case, third-choice goalkeepers often wear the number 26, or the number 23, which was the previous number of players allowed in a squad until 2021. Prior to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], only 22 players were permitted in international squads; therefore, the third goalkeeper was often allocated the number 22 jersey in previous tournaments.

The move to a fixed number being assigned to each player in a squad was initiated for the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]] where each man in a country's 22-man squad wore a specific number for the duration of the tournament. As a result, the numbers 12 to 22 were assigned to different squad players, with no resemblance to their on-field positions. This meant that a team could start a match not necessarily fielding players wearing numbers one to eleven. Although the numbers one to eleven tended to be given to those players deemed to be the "first choice line-up", this was not always the case for a variety of reasons – a famous example was [[Johan Cruyff]], who insisted on wearing the number 14 shirt for the Netherlands.

In the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]], the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]] forgot to send the player numbers list to the event organization. However, the Uruguayan official Lorenzo Villizzio assigned random numbers to the players. The [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Gylmar dos Santos Neves|Gilmar]] received the number 3, and [[Garrincha]] and [[Zagallo]] wore opposite winger numbers, 11 and 7, while [[Pelé]] was randomly given the number 10, for which he became famous.<ref>[http://www.mienet.com/sports/soccer/2006world_cup/documents/3C75E9E67D775FA74B27B6F7C1DD3A6EE2BD3EE4.html Soccer and World Cup Trivia & Curiosities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202121941/http://www.mienet.com/sports/soccer/2006world_cup/documents/3C75E9E67D775FA74B27B6F7C1DD3A6EE2BD3EE4.html |date=2 December 2008 }}, Mienet.com.

[[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] defied convention by numbering their squads for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]], [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] World Cups alphabetically, resulting in outfield players (not goalkeepers) wearing the number 1 shirt (although [[Diego Maradona]] was given out-of-sequence number 10 in both 1982 and 1986, while [[Mario Kempes]] in 1982 and [[Jorge Valdano]] in 1986 were allowed to use number 11).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/teams/team=43922.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025054513/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/teams/team=43922.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 October 2007|title=Argentina squad 1982 World Cup|website=fifa.com|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> In [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]] Argentina also used the alphabetical system, but only to line players and goalkeepers [[Daniel Carnevali]] and [[Ubaldo Fillol]] wore traditional goalkeeping numbers 1 and 12 respectively.

Before the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], the [[Argentine Football Association]] (AFA) attempted to retire the number 10 in honour of Maradona by submitting a squad list of 23 players for the tournament, listed 1 through 24, with the number 10 omitted. FIFA rejected Argentina's plan, with the governing body's president [[Sepp Blatter]] suggesting the number 10 shirt be instead given to the team's third-choice goalkeeper, [[Roberto Bonano]]. The AFA ultimately submitted a revised list with [[Ariel Ortega]], originally listed as number 23, as the number 10.<ref>{{cite news

In early era of Chinese football, number 0 was often assigned to a substitute goalkeeper. At least four goalkeepers had been recorded wearing number 0 on field during the early years of professional league of China: Zhao Lei from [[Sichuan Quanxing]], Wang Zhenjie from [[Bayi Football Team|August 1]], Li Jiming from [[Tianjin Jinmen Tiger|Tianjin Lifei]] and Li Yun from [[Shanghai Yuyuan]].

* [[Gary Hooper]] wore shirt number 88 at [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] as his number 10 was already taken and 88 is the year (1988) he was born in. "88" (1888) is also the year [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] played their first game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/clubs/celtic/188621-hooper-to-wear-number-88-for-celtic/|title=Hooper to wear number 88 for Celtic|date=27 July 2010|website=[[STV (TV channel)|STV Sport]]|location=Scotland|access-date=11 January 2015|archive-date=18 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218185323/http://sport.stv.tv/football/clubs/celtic/188621-hooper-to-wear-number-88-for-celtic/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The season after Hooper signed, new signing [[Victor Wanyama]] chose the number 67 to honour the Lisbon Lions, Celtic's European Cup winning team of 1967.

He also wore the number 6 in his second stint for [[Club América|Club America]] in his first season at the club, as his traditional number 13 was taken by [[Leonel López]]. He chose the number 6 because that was the date his niece was born, and it was the day he signed for Club America.<ref>{{Cite web|title=¿Por qué Memo Ochoa usa el número '6' con América? {{!}} Goal.com|url=https://www.goal.com/es/noticias/memo-ochoa-usara-numero-6-america/1iejnccqm9vr919bb2u0nsgtna|access-date=11 August 2021|website=www.goal.com}}</ref>
*When [[Róger Guedes]] signed for [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista]], he chose the number 123. He chose this because the numbers go 1, 2, 3..., because he has been wearing 23 for years and now that he has a son he wants to begin a new chapter of his life, which includes a new number, but still wants to retain some connection, and also because [[Fagner Conserva Lemos]] was already wearing the 23.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://remonews.com/brazileng/roger-guedes-explains-the-choice-of-number-123-at-corinthians-and-promises-you-can-expect-a-lot-of-competition/|title = Roger Guedes explains the choice of number 123 at Corinthians and promises: 'You can expect a lot of competition'}}</ref> On substitution boards, it will show 12 or 23 and someone will tell Guedes that he is going on/off.
*When [[Andrés Iniesta]] left [[FC Barcelona]] in 2018, a special "#Infinit8Iniesta" shirt was released. Although Iniesta never wore it in a match, it was sold to fans.

* [[Mario Balotelli]] wore the number 45 across several stints at [[Inter Milan]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[A.C. Milan]] and [[FC Sion]]. Originally, he received the squad number at Inter Milan prior to his first four matches there as youngsters at the club were assigned the squad numbers 36 to 50, explaining that he had joked that "four plus five is nine" and that he "ended up scoring a goal in all four of those matches and brought him luck". The number stuck with Balotelli after his move to Manchester City in 2010, swapping the squad number 9 with youngster [[Greg Cunningham]], who had the squad number 45. This continued after his first stint at A.C. Milan, continuing to his move to Liverpool and then his second move to A.C. Milan on loan. However, he resorted to the squad number 9 for his stints at [[OGC Nice]], [[Olympique de Marseille]], and his first stint at [[Adana Demirspor]], before going back to 45 at [[FC Sion]]. However, after FC Sion were relegated, Balotelli moved back to Adana Demirspor and chose the squad number 99.
