In [[association football]], '''one-touch football''' is passing or shooting [[Ball (association football)|the ball]] with ''one touch'' rather than trapping or [[Dribbling (association football)|dribbling]] the ball first. Often an effective tactic for quick shots from passes or crosses, "flick" passes or for "give and go" passes. One or two touch scrimmages or drills are also used to improve teamwork and passing skills.<ref name="theguardian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/may/21/newsstory.sport1|title=One-touch perfectionist &#124; Football &#124; The Observer|date=21 May 2000 |publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref>

This skill is most commonly executed by teams with skillful midfielders and a cohesive frontline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/trainingground/coaches/video/videoid=902993.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422233021/http://www.uefa.com/trainingground/coaches/video/videoid=902993.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 22, 2012 |title=RFEF one-touch passing move drill II |publisher=[[UEFA]] |date= |access-date=2016-03-27}}</ref> The attackers usually act like target men bringing in other players by simple but elegant 'flicks' or just slight and accurate touches. This style of football, when executed effectively, creates many decoys for opposing defenders, and also creates space for the attacking midfielders to try long-range efforts. It has been observed to be most effective when used in counterattacks by teams with quick and visionary attackers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/my-football/coaching/practices/conti---one-touch-give-and-go |title=Conti - One Touch Give And Go - Football Coaching |publisher=The FA |date= |accessdate=2016-03-27}}</ref>
