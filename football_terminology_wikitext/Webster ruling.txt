The '''Webster ruling''' is a [[test case (law)|test case]] in association football [[sports law|law]] involving [[Andy Webster (footballer, born 1982)|Andy Webster]], a [[defender (association football)|defender]] formerly with [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] [[football club]] in Edinburgh, Scotland. In September 2006 he became the first player to exploit the updated [[transfer (football)|transfer regulations]] of [[FIFA]], football's [[sport governing body|governing body]], which stipulated that players are able to unilaterally walk away from a contract after a fixed period, regardless of the duration of the contract itself. Although the long-term effects of the decision remain unclear, it has been compared to the landmark [[Bosman ruling]] of 1995 in its potential significance.<ref name="landmark">{{cite news | last = Harris | first = Nick | title = Webster ruling sets transfer landmark | newspaper = [[The Independent]] | date = 5 May 2007 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/webster-ruling-sets-transfer-landmark-447523.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080406201322/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/webster-ruling-sets-transfer-landmark-447523.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 6 April 2008 | location=London}}</ref><ref name="revolution">{{cite news | last = Spiers | first = Graham | author-link = Graham Spiers | title = Andy Webster ruling set to herald a revolution to rival Bosman | newspaper = [[The Times]] | date = 31 January 2008 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article3279498.ece | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080821145135/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article3279498.ece | url-status = dead | archive-date = 21 August 2008 | location=London}}</ref><ref name="exit-door">{{cite news | last = Nisbet | first = John | title = Webster ruling opens exit door for 'big-name stars' | newspaper = [[The Independent]] | date = 21 February 2008 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/webster-ruling-opens-exit-door-for-bigname-stars-784861.html | location=London}}</ref>

==Background==
===Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players<!--This section heading is the name of a legal ruling and should be in capitals. Please do not attempt to "correct" this. -->===
The regulations which led to the Webster ruling were enacted in response to the [[European Commission]], who in 1998 opined that [[FIFA]]'s then current [[transfer (football)|football transfer system]] served as an obstruction to players' [[freedom of movement]] compared to workers in other industries.<ref name="d-day">{{cite news | title = Transfer D-day put off | publisher = [[BBC Sport]] | date = 6 October 2000 | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/959827.stm }}</ref><ref name="soccernet">{{cite web | title = EC warns FIFA over transfers | publisher = Soccernet | date = 19 June 2000 | url = http://soccernet.espn.go.com/euro2000/news/20000619fifatransfers.html | access-date = 24 May 2008 | archive-date = 4 October 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121004212317/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/euro2000/news/20000619fifatransfers.html | url-status = dead }}</ref> FIFA, and its European governing body [[UEFA]], campaigned for a special exemption for football,<ref name="safe">{{cite news | title = Blatter: Transfer system safe | publisher = [[BBC Sport]] | date = 10 January 2001 | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1110566.stm }}</ref><ref name="optimistic">{{cite news | title = Fifa optimistic over transfer talks | publisher = [[BBC Sport]] | date = 10 December 2000 | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1064846.stm }}</ref> but after the Commission threatened to abolish the system, the new regulations were put in place by September 2001. Because of the complexity and potential legal ramifications for players, it was five years before Webster's test case emerged.<ref name="pay-as-you-go">{{cite news | last = Harris | first = Nick | title = Stars will buy into 'pay as you go' system | newspaper = [[The Independent]] | date = 13 February 2007 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/stars-will-buy-into-pay-as-you-go-system-436166.html | location=London}}</ref>

===Article 17===
Article 17 of FIFA's ''Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players'' is entitled "Consequences of Terminating a Contract Without Just Cause", and is the fifth article of Chapter IV, "Maintenance of Contractual Stability between Professionals and Clubs". It outlines the provisions which apply if a contract is terminated without just cause, and the requirement for the party in breach to pay compensation.<ref name=regulations>{{Cite web | title = Regulations for the Status and Transfer of Players | pages = 14, 33 | url = https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/status_transfer_en_25.pdf  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070922234650/http://fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/status%5ftransfer%5fen%5f25.pdf  | url-status = dead  | archive-date = 22 September 2007  }}</ref> Specifically, it states that any player who signed a contract before the age of 28 can buy himself out of the contract three years after the deal was signed.

==FIFA and CAS rulings on the Webster case==
Hearts had initially placed a valuation of £5&nbsp;million on Webster.<ref name="demanding">{{cite news | title = Hearts demanding £5m for Webster | publisher = [[BBC Sport]] | date = 17 March 2007 | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6462949.stm }}</ref> However, because he had served more than three years of his contract he was outside of FIFA's "protected period", and any compensation due to Hearts would, per Article 17, be based primarily on the amount of Webster's salary still outstanding—a figure estimated by Webster's advisors at approximately £250,000.<ref name="landmark"/>

FIFA's transfer arbitration tribunal, the Dispute Resolution Chamber, met on 4 April 2007 and ruled that Hearts were due £625,000, based on Webster's future wages, his earning potential, and the legal costs.<ref name="625k">{{cite news |title = Webster must pay Hearts £625,000 | publisher = [[BBC Sport]] | date = 4 May 2007 | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/6526119.stm}}</ref><ref name="drc">{{Cite web | title = Decision of the Dispute Resolution Chamber | date = 4 April 2007 | pages = 19 | url = https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/47936_15014.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110222173852/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/47936_15014.pdf| url-status = dead| archive-date = 22 February 2011}}</ref> They also found Webster guilty of breaking his contract "without just cause", although only on a technicality; he and his [[sports agent|agent]] were late informing the club of his intention to leave, because of confusion over the final match of the season (Hearts had reached the [[2006 Scottish Cup Final]], but the time limit was calculated from the club's last league game, four days prior to the Cup match). For this he was suspended for the first two weeks of the 2007–08 season.<ref name="landmark"/>

Hearts were quick to lodge an appeal against the ruling, disputing the figure which they said had not been unambiguously calculated.<ref name="appeal">{{cite news | last = MacDonald | first = Kenny | title = Hearts appeal FIFA's Webster ruling | work = [[Reuters]] | date = 25 May 2007 | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL2519224120070525| archive-url = https://archive.today/20120716092707/http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL2519224120070525| url-status = dead| archive-date = 16 July 2012}}</ref><ref name="challenge">{{cite news | title = Hearts challenge Webster ruling | publisher = [[BBC Sport]] | date = 25 May 2007 | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/6692841.stm }}</ref> Webster had also indicated a desire to appeal, believing the fine against him was excessive.<ref name="625k appeal">{{cite web | title = Webster may appeal FIFA fine | publisher = [[Eurosport]] | date = 9 May 2007 | url = http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/09052007/58/spl-webster-appeal-fifa-fine.html}}</ref> On 30 January 2008 the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]], the highest arbitration authority in sport, met in [[Lausanne]] and clarified the original ruling.<ref name="award">{{Cite web | title = Award&nbsp;— CAS 2007/A/1298/1299/1300 Wigan Athletic FC/Heart of Midlothian/Webster | date = 30 January 2008 | url = http://jurisprudence.tas-cas.org/sites/CaseLaw/Shared%20Documents/1298,%201299,%201300.pdf }}</ref> They also reduced the compensation due payable by Webster to £150,000.<ref name="revolution"/><ref name="vindication">{{cite news | last = MacPherson | first = Graeme | title = Vindication for Webster but a 'dark day' for clubs | newspaper = [[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|location=Glasgow | date = 31 January 2008 | url = http://www.theherald.co.uk/sport/headlines/display.var.2007018.0.Vindication_for_Webster_but_a_dark_day_for_clubs.php }}{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Reactions and analysis==

FIFA were highly critical of the ruling; president [[Sepp Blatter]] said "the verdict in favour of the player will have far-reaching and damaging effects on the game as a whole. [It] is... a Pyrrhic victory for those players and their agents who toy with the idea of rescinding contracts before they have been fulfilled."<ref name="criticise">{{cite web | title = FIFA criticizes CAS ruling on soccer contract dispute

Conversely, players' organisations were highly supportive of CAS's decision. [[Tony Higgins]], a Scottish representative of international footballers' union [[FIFPro]], said "Article 17 gives footballers the sort of employee rights that anyone else would expect in the workplace",<ref name="revolution"/> while [[Fraser Wishart]], the general secretary of the Scottish players' union who had supported Webster's case, described it as "a new groundbreaking decision enabling players to enjoy greater freedom of employment."<ref name="iht-cas"/>

Despite the circumstances of his departure, Webster returned to play for Hearts again from February 2011 to May 2013, winning the Scottish Cup with the club in 2012.
