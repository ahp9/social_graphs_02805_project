'''Prawn sandwich brigade''' is a derogatory term for people who attend [[Football in England|English football]] matches primarily to enjoy [[luxury box]]es and corporate hospitality, rather than support a team or enjoy the sport.<ref>{{cite web |last=Warshaw |first=Andrew |title=Prawn sandwich, sir? |url=http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/Kind%3D128/newsId%3D248342.html |website=[[UEFA]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041025002004/http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/Kind=128/newsId=248342.html |archive-date=25 October 2004 |date=22 October 2004}}</ref>

The term originated from a media comment by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] captain [[Roy Keane]], who felt that certain sections of the crowd hadn't been vocal enough in their support, and at times too quick to criticise minor mistakes, during the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] game against [[Dynamo Kyiv]] in November 2000:<ref name=Keane_quote>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/champions_league/1014868.stm |title=Angry Keane slates Man Utd fans |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=2000-11-09 |access-date=2012-01-05}}</ref>

{{cquote|Away from home our fans are fantastic, I'd call them the hardcore fans. But at home they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch.<ref name=Keane_quote />}}

The term is often attributed to a direct Keane quote; in fact, the term originated in the print media in reaction to Keane's comments.<ref name=Keane_quote />

The 2009 film ''[[The Damned United]]'' depicts [[Brian Clough]] castigating the directors of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] for luxuriating in corporate hospitality suites with "prawn sandwiches" but "failing to understand" the game of football. The scene is set in 1973, but Clough's tirade in the film was probably inspired by Keane's comments of 2000.{{Citation needed|date=May 2024}}
