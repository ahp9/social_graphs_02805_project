'''The Famous Five''' is the collective term for [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]]'s [[Formation (association football)#Classic formations|forward line]] of [[Gordon Smith (footballer born 1924)|Gordon Smith]], [[Bobby Johnstone]], [[Lawrie Reilly]], [[Eddie Turnbull]] and [[Willie Ormond]]. The north stand at [[Easter Road]] was named in their honour when it was rebuilt in 1995.<ref>[http://www.hibernianfc.co.uk/FAMOUS%20FIVE.pdf Seating plan of the Famous Five stand] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530094300/http://www.hibernianfc.co.uk/FAMOUS%20FIVE.pdf |date=2008-05-30 }}, [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] official site.</ref> All five players have been inducted into the [[Scottish Football Hall of Fame]].<ref name = "2010 inductee">{{cite news |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/sport/Caldo-hails-Hibs-spirit-after.6626282.jp |title=Caldo hails Hibs spirit after fightback |last=Strachan |first=Colleen |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=15 November 2010}}</ref>

The first time that the Famous Five all started together in a competitive match was on 15 October 1949 versus [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] at [[Easter Road]]. The [[Edinburgh]] club won the match 2–0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qosfc.com/history|title=QosFC: Club History|publisher=}}</ref> The first time they ever played together however, was in a pre-season friendly match against Nithsdale Wanderers at Sanquhar, when they won 7-2. The last match all five players started together was against [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]] at Easter Road on 29 January 1955. Despite Ormond and Reilly getting both on the scoresheet, the visitors won the match 3–2.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/hibs/60th-anniversary-famous-fives-final-match-1514102 | title=60th anniversary of the Famous Five’s final match | work=[[The Scotsman]] | date=29 January 2015| accessdate=23 April 2020}}<br />{{cite web |title=ON THIS DAY IN 1965|  url=http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/videos/230214/on-this-day-in-1965-hibernians-famous-five-the-finest-forward-line-in-scottish-football-history-play-together-for-last-time.html | publisher=Who Ate All The Pies | date=29 January 2016 | accessdate=23 April 2020}}</ref>

Most or all of the players featured significantly as Hibs won [[Scottish football champions|league championships]] in [[1947–48 in Scottish football|1948]], [[1950–51 in Scottish football|1951]] and [[1951–52 in Scottish football|1952]] – a remarkable achievement given that the club has only won one other championship, in [[1902–03 in Scottish football|1903]]. Hibs also finished second to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in [[1952–53 in Scottish football|1953]] on [[goal average]] and second to Rangers by a point in [[1949–50 in Scottish football|1950]]. The team was less successful in cup competitions, however. Their only [[Scottish Cup Final]] appearance in this period was in [[1947 Scottish Cup Final|1947]], where they lost 2&ndash;1 to [[Dave Halliday]]'s [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]].<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20050227/ai_n11838182/ FEELING LUCKY?], ''[[Sunday Herald]]'', 27 February 2005.</ref> Hibs reached the final of the [[Coronation Cup (football)|Coronation Cup]] in 1953 by winning against [[Newcastle United]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur]], but lost 2–0 to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in the final despite dominating play.<ref>[https://www.rsssf.org/tablesc/coronation53.html Coronation Cup in Glasgow 1953], [[RSSSF]].</ref>

It was due to this successful period that Hibs played in the inaugural [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]] in the [[European Cup 1955–56|1955–56 season]],<ref>{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20070713074544/http://www.europeancuphistory.com/euro56.html Season 1955–56]}}, www.europeancuphistory.com</ref> even though the club had only finished in 5th place in [[1954–55 in Scottish football|1955]], 15 points behind [[Scottish football champions|champions]] [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]].<ref>[http://www.afc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/clubNewsDetail/0,,10284~1055020,00.html Dons denied Euro spot..] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006040536/http://www.afc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/clubNewsDetail/0,,10284~1055020,00.html |date=2007-10-06 }}, [[Aberdeen F.C.]] official site.</ref> The club reached the semi-finals of the European Cup, losing to [[Stade Reims]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0043/print.shtml|title=BBC - A Sporting Nation - Hibernian reach the first European Cup semi-finals 1956|publisher=}}</ref>

The forward line was never picked as a whole unit for a Scottish international side. Four of the players appeared in a [[Scottish League XI]] game in October 1952, with Turnbull replaced by [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] player [[Billy Steel]]. Reilly scored four of the five Scotland goals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.londonhearts.com/SFL/games/19521008.html|title=Wed 08 Oct 1952  SFL 5 League Of Ireland 1|publisher=London Hearts Supporters' Club|accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>
