"'''Anti-football'''", also known colloquially as '''[[haram]]ball''' or '''football terrorism''', is a playing style in [[association football]] that emphasises a highly defensive and aggressive approach, relying mainly on passing and involving the deployment of all team members except the striker behind the ball. The goal of the tactic is to prevent the opposing team from scoring, rather than pursuing an offensive strategy to win the game. Managers known for such tactics include [[Massimiliano Allegri]], [[Mikel Arteta]], [[José Bordalás]], [[Antonio Conte]], [[Sean Dyche]], [[José Mourinho]], [[Diego Simeone]], [[Thomas Tuchel]], [[Walter Smith]], and [[Hugo Broos]], among others.<ref name="haramball"/> Managers accused of playing anti-football usually deny using such tactics,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13436825/mikel-arteta-arsenal-manager-responds-to-critics-calling-him-overcautious-after-draw-with-man-city|title=Mikel Arteta: Arsenal manager responds to critics calling him overcautious after draw with Man City|first=Sam|last=Blitz|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=24 September 2025}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/sports/conte-fires-back-at-anti-football-criticism-of-tactics-idUSKBN1GG0Z3/|title=Conte fires back at 'anti-football' criticism of tactics|first=Simon|last=Evans|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=5 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11708/11704416/burnley-boss-sean-dyche-rejects-anti-football-claims-by-david-luiz|title=Burnley boss Sean Dyche rejects 'anti-football' claims by David Luiz|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=26 April 2019}}</ref> though Smith openly admitted to using anti-football tactics at [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] following criticism from [[Lionel Messi]] after Messi's [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] drew 0–0 away in the [[UEFA Champions League]] (UCL) with Smith's Rangers in the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|2007–08 season]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ftbl.com.au/news/smith-stands-by-euro-tactics-99121|title=Smith stands by Euro tactics|date=11 December 2007|publisher=FTBL}}</ref>

The term is also used to describe teams that intentionally prevent the game from progressing by kicking the ball forward without attempting to reach any players, engaging in acts of diving and time-wasting, and kicking the ball away during free kicks. Such actions often result in a yellow card by the referee.

[[UEFA]], the governing body of football in [[Europe]], offers a [[UEFA Respect Fair Play ranking|fair play prize]] to teams that prioritise fair play, including avoiding anti-football tactics. Teams that seek to "unlock" the game by playing offensively, taking risks, retaining possession and avoiding fouls, receive higher fair play scores. The three highest-rated teams in Europe automatically qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] from 1995 to the 2014–15 season. They continue to receive a monetary reward for their fair play.

== History and usage ==
The term "anti-football" has been used in English since at least 2001, when [[Gary Armstrong (footballer)|Gary Armstrong]] and Richard Giulianotti used it in their book ''Fear and Loathing in World Football'' to describe the tactics of Argentine club [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] during the 1968 [[Intercontinental Cup (1960–2004)|Copa Intercontinental]]. They cited a 1968 editorial in the Argentine sports magazine [[El Gráfico (Argentina)|El Gráfico]] that had used the phrase.<ref>{{cite book |author=Gary Armstrong & Richard Giulianotti |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKAeC-Zpw9YC&q=%22anti+football%22+2001&pg=RA6-PA242 |title=Fear and Loathing in World Football |year=2001 |isbn=978-1859734636 |pages=242| publisher=Berg Publishers }}</ref>

[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s [[Cesc Fàbregas]] used the phrase to describe the style of play in the [[Premier League|English Premier League]] after a frustrating 1–0 defeat to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Sheppard |first=David |date=10 November 2006 |title=Fabregas slates the 'anti-football' of Premiership rivals |work=ESPN |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=390941 |url-status=dead |access-date=30 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207010855/http://www.espnfc.com/story/390941 |archive-date=7 February 2018}}</ref> In 2007, Fàbregas had a heated exchange with fellow ex-Barcelona player, [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] manager [[Mark Hughes]], who defended his team's style of play.<ref>{{cite news |author=Michael Wade |date=19 April 2011 |title=Six of the best: Cesc Fabregas run-ins |work=Talksport |url=https://talksport.com/magazine/features/2011-04-19/six-best-cesc-fabregas-run-ins}}</ref>

During their run to the [[2008 UEFA Cup final|2008 UEFA Cup Final]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] manager [[Walter Smith]] deployed an ultra-defensive strategy dubbed "[[Catenaccio|Watenaccio]]" (a reference to the defensive system ''Catenaccio'', which was popularised in the 1960s in Italian football).<ref>{{cite news |date=1 January 2010 |title=Forget Watenaccio – Walter Smith's Rangers can go for Celtic's jugular |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jan/01/walter-smith-rangers-celtic-spl |access-date=4 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=14 May 2008 |title=Uefa Cup final tactics |work=BBC |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7400437.stm |access-date=4 January 2014}}</ref> The tactics drew criticism from opposition players, including Barcelona's [[Lionel Messi]], who described them as "anti-football" after failing to score against Rangers in a 0–0 draw.<ref>{{cite news |date=24 October 2007 |title=Rangers played anti-football, bemoans Messi |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/24/championsleague4 |access-date=4 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=24 October 2007 |title=Barcelona's Lionel Messi hits out at Rangers |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2324036/Barcelonas-Lionel-Messi-hits-out-at-Rangers.html |access-date=4 January 2014}}</ref>

In 2010, [[Johan Cruyff]] applied the term "anti-football" to the style of play used by the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup final|FIFA World Cup final]] against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. He criticised the Dutch team for renouncing their commitment to attacking and entertaining football and for playing "dirty". Other commentators had already described the Dutch style of play during the tournament as "anti-football".<ref>{{cite news |date=2010-07-12 |title=World Cup final: Johan Cruyff hits out at 'anti-football' Holland |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/12/world-cup-final-johan-cruyff-holland}}</ref>

[[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]] manager [[Henrique Calisto]] used the phrase "anti-football" after his team's defeat to the [[Philippines national football team|Philippines]] at the [[2010 AFF Championship|2010 AFF Suzuki Cup]] group stage in Vietnam.<ref>{{cite news |date=2010-12-06 |title=Historic victory leaves McMenemy bewildered |work=AFF Suzuki Cup 2010 |url=http://www.affsuzukicup.com/_webapp_735740/Historic_victory_leaves_McMenemy_bewildered |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207052857/http://www.affsuzukicup.com/_webapp_735740/Historic_victory_leaves_McMenemy_bewildered |archive-date=7 December 2010}}</ref>

After [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]'s defeat to [[France national football team|France]] in the semi-finals of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Belgium goalkeeper [[Thibaut Courtois]] accused the French team of playing "anti-football" for their defensive tactics despite having significantly more shots on goal and less possession than Belgium.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kalinic |first=Dejan |date=2018-07-10 |title=Belgium loss to France: Les Bleus are 'an anti-football team', says Thibaut Courtois |url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/world-cup-2018-france-belgium-thibaut-courtois/12nasz5kkb03y1tc6vo416hl03 |access-date=2020-10-01 |website=Goal.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Taylor |first=Daniel |date=2018-07-10 |title=Samuel Umtiti header put France in World Cup final with win over Belgium |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/10/france-belgium-world-cup-semi-final-match-report |access-date=2020-10-01 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> He later apologised for the comments.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=2018-07-15 |title=Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois Apologises to France & Backtracks on His Criticism of Les Bleus' Tactics |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/07/15/chelseas-thibaut-courtois-apologises-france-backtracks-his-criticism-les-bleus-tactics |access-date=2023-11-21 |magazine=Sports Illustrated |language=en-us}}</ref>

The term "haramball" originated on social media in the early 2020s. It is mainly used alongside [[Photoshop]] edits of managers' faces onto infamous terrorists such as [[Osama bin Laden]], [[Sadam Hussein]], and [[Adolf Hitler]], particularly after a bad run of results or a boring performance.
