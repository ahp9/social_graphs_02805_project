[[File:Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain rabona (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain]] performing a rabona while warming up for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 2013]]

In [[association football]], the '''rabona''' is the technique of kicking the [[Association football ball|football]] where the kicking leg is crossed behind the back of the standing leg.

There are several reasons why a player might opt to strike the ball this way: for example, a right-footed [[Striker (association football)|striker]] advancing towards the goal slightly on the left side rather than having the goal straight in front may feel that his shot power or accuracy with his left foot is inadequate (more colloquially, the player has "no left"), so will perform a rabona in order to take a better shot. Another scenario could be a right-footed [[winger (football)|winger]] sending a cross while playing on the left side of the pitch without having to turn first. Another reason why a player could perform a rabona might be to confuse a defending player, or simply to show off their own ability, as it is considered a skillful trick at any level.

== History ==
''Rabona'' in Spanish means to play [[Truancy|hooky]], to skip school.  The name derives from its first documented performance by [[Ricardo Infante]] in a game between [[Estudiantes de La Plata|Estudiantes de la Plata]] and [[Rosario Central]] in 1948.<ref name="The art of Rabona">{{cite news|url= https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1856678-20-football-tricks-and-the-players-who-invented-them |title=20 Football Tricks and the Players Who Invented Them|publisher=Bleacher Report|date=24 November 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.clarin.com/deportes/stylecolorBF1424Planeta-Redondoibr-fundador-rabona_0_474552831.html "El fundador de la rabona"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024819/http://www.clarin.com/deportes/stylecolorBF1424Planeta-Redondoibr-fundador-rabona_0_474552831.html |date=2016-03-04 }}. {{in lang|es}} Clarin.com</ref> The football magazine ''[[El Gráfico (Argentina)|El Gráfico]]'' published a front cover showing Infante dressed as a schoolboy with the caption "El infante que se hizo la rabona" (In English: "The kid who plays hooky").<ref name="Enraptured">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/news/y=2011/m=10/news=enraptured-rabonas-1527054.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811083130/http://www.fifa.com/news/y=2011/m=10/news=enraptured-rabonas-1527054.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 11, 2015|title=Enraptured by 'rabonas'|publisher=FIFA.com|date=24 October 2014|access-date=9 April 2016}}</ref> Another supposed origin for the name is that ''Rabona'' is derived from the Spanish word ''rabo'' for [[tail]], and that the move resembled the swishing of a cow's tail between or around its legs. In Brazil, the move is also known as the ''chaleira'' ([[kettle]]) or ''letra'' ([[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]).<ref name="Cocò Roccotelli, il mago della rabona"/>

The first filmed rabona was performed by Brazilian footballer [[Pelé]] in the [[Campeonato Paulista|São Paulo state championship]] in 1957. [[Giovanni Roccotelli|Giovanni "Cocò" Roccotelli]] is credited with popularising the rabona in Italy during the 1970s; at the time, this move was simply called a "crossed-kick" (''incrociata'', in Italian).<ref name="Cocò Roccotelli, il mago della rabona">{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Primo_Piano/2007/02_Febbraio/02/roccotelli.shtml|title=Cocò Roccotelli, il mago della rabona|trans-title=Cocò Roccotelli, the rabona wizard|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=it|author1=Sebastiano Vernazza|date=2 February 2007|access-date=22 December 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mondopicchio.it/viewnews19.php?id_news=6 "Giovanni Roccotelli"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928091829/http://www.mondopicchio.it/viewnews19.php?id_news=6 |date=28 September 2007 }} {{in lang|it}}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportpiceno.biz/giovanniroccotelli.htm "Cocò, l'acrobata del numero 7"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219234704/http://www.sportpiceno.biz/giovanniroccotelli.htm |date=19 February 2009 }} {{in lang|it}}</ref>
