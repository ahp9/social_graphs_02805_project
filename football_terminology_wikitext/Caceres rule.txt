{{Short description|Transfer regulation in Australian rules football}}

The '''Caceres rule''', also known as the '''Anthony Caceres rule''' or '''Caceres Clause''', is a transfer regulation imposed by [[Football Australia]] that prevents a player from being registered in an [[A-League]] season if said player was purchased by a [[Holding company|multi-club ownership/partnership]] (MCO) and loaned to an MCO related A-League club.<ref name="ref0">{{cite web |title='Caceres Clause' to be reviewed ahead of 2024-25 A-Leagues Season |url=https://aleagues.com.au/news/a-league-rule-change-caceres-clause-explained-latest-updated/ |publisher=[[A-Leagues]] |access-date=10 August 2024 |language=en-AU |date=8 August 2024}}</ref> This applies until the player's preceding A-League contract is completed or the expiry of the two transfer windows during the domestic season, including the window in which the player was purchased.<ref name="ref0"/>

== History ==
During the [[2015–16 A-League|2015–16 season]] of the [[A-League]], on 15 January 2016, [[Anthony Caceres]] was signed by English club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for a [[Transfer (association football)|transfer fee]] of [[Australian dollar|AU$]]300,000 from [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]].<ref>{{cite web |title=BREAKING NEWS: Caceres set for Manchester City transfer |url=https://ccmariners.com.au/news/breaking-news-caceres-set-manchester-city-transfer/ |publisher=[[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]] |access-date=10 August 2024 |language=en-AU |date=15 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Beveridge |first1=Riley |title=Manchester City transfers: Anthony Caceres, Luke Brattan head to Premier League giants |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/a-league/manchester-city-transfers-anthony-caceres-luke-brattan-head-to-premier-league-giants/news-story/62105aff5b84060a4f923d42536a7f6e |work=Fox Sports |access-date=10 August 2024 |language=en |date=19 January 2016}}</ref> Four days after his signing to City, Caceres was sent on loan to A-League rivals [[Melbourne City FC|Melbourne City]], who are under the same ownership as Manchester City, for the remainder of the season.<ref>{{cite web |title=City Signs Caceres On Loan |url=https://melbournecityfc.com.au/news/city-signs-caceres-loan/ |publisher=[[Melbourne City FC|Melbourne City]] |access-date=10 August 2024 |language=en-AU |date=19 January 2016}}</ref> The move sparked controversy as it was deemed a loophole to a rule which prohibits A-League clubs to request, offer or pay a transfer fee for a player in a national league club; Melbourne City would not have been able to sign Caceres without the influence of Manchester City.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beveridge |first1=Riley |title=Anthony Caceres to Manchester City: FFA to conduct review of its transfer system |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/a-league/anthony-caceres-to-manchester-city-ffa-to-conduct-review-of-its-transfer-system/news-story/3b6557e75dd0b6440598c2b2b649ab8d |work=Fox Sports |access-date=10 August 2024 |language=en |date=19 January 2016}}</ref> [[Sydney FC]] chief executive officer [[Tony Pignata]] criticised the move since it gave an advantage for clubs under a club-model despite it being within the competitions regulations.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Davutovic |first1=David |title=Anthony Caceres joins Melbourne City: A-League clubs calling for loan review in wake of Anthony Caceres loan |url=https://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/football/anthony-caceres-joins-melbourne-city-aleague-clubs-calling-for-loan-review-in-wake-of-anthony-caceres-loan/news-story/95ed8132f92731de17a2192db7b6e55c?amp&nk=ffe5dfa26e32154e450d2e720ae31e24-1723301743 |website=Herald Sun |access-date=10 August 2024 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240810145527/https://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/football/anthony-caceres-joins-melbourne-city-aleague-clubs-calling-for-loan-review-in-wake-of-anthony-caceres-loan/news-story/95ed8132f92731de17a2192db7b6e55c?amp&nk=ffe5dfa26e32154e450d2e720ae31e24-1723301743 |archive-date=10 August 2024 |language=en-AU |date=19 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Rosengarten |first1=Jake |title=Real story of the $300k transfer so controversial it changed the rules of the A-Leagues |url=https://aleagues.com.au/news/a-league-transfers-news-sydney-fc-melbourne-city-tickets-details-latest-caceres/ |publisher=A-Leagues |access-date=10 August 2024 |language=en-AU |date=11 May 2023}}</ref>

As a result, after a review of the transfer, [[Football Australia]] sent a memo to all participating A-League clubs about a rule change that prohibits players, who were purchased by a multi-club ownership, from being sent on loan to a sister club in the A-League until the player's preceding contract in the A-League is completed or the two domestic transfer windows have passed since the date of the signing.<ref name="ref1">{{cite web |last1=Davutovic |first1=David |title=FFA set to introduce 'Anthony Caceres rule' to stop Melbourne City signing players through its brother club Manchester City |url=https://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/football/a-league/ffa-set-to-introduce-anthony-caceres-rule-to-stop-melbourne-city-signing-players-through-its-brother-club-manchester-city/news-story/25f81cec94d6962b204a2d7da9c3b67a |website=Herald Sun |access-date=10 August 2024 |language=en-AU |date=2 May 2016}}</ref>

The clause was reviewed once more in August 2024 after the introduction of [[Auckland FC]], which shares a similar club model to Melbourne City, under owner [[Bill Foley (businessman)|Bill Foley]].<ref name="ref0"/> This was further called upon due to the loan signing of goalkeeper [[Alex Paulsen]] from [[AFC Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] to sister club Auckland. Paulsen recently played for [[Wellington Phoenix FC|Wellington Phoenix]] in the [[2023–24 A-League Men|2023–24]] season before signing for Bournemouth for a transfer fee in June. Auckland's chief executive officer Nick Becker said that all clubs in the A-League agreed the 'Caceres rule' needed reviewing and potentially taken out for future seasons.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Toogood |first1=Will |title=Auckland FC sign ex-Phoenix star Alex Paulsen on loan from Premier League club Bournemouth |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/football/auckland-fc/auckland-fc-sign-ex-phoenix-star-alex-paulsen-on-loan-from-premier-league-club-bournemouth/J2LCBIFVGBBAPHATLJO2GX6HMQ/ |publisher=NZ Herald |access-date=10 August 2024 |language=en |date=8 August 2024}}</ref> However, Wellington Phoenix released a statement from general manager David Dome, asking for clarification on the loan signing despite supporting the adaption of the clause to allow Paulsen into the league.<ref>{{cite web |title=Club statement from general manager David Dome |url=https://wellingtonphoenix.com/news/club-statement-from-general-manager-david-dome/ |publisher=[[Wellington Phoenix FC|Wellington Phoenix]] |access-date=10 August 2024 |language=en-AU |date=8 August 2024}}</ref>
