In the sport of [[association football]], a '''forward''' (or '''attacker''') is an [[Glossary of association football terms#O|outfield position]] which primarily plays further up the pitch than [[Midfielder|midfielders]] and [[Defender (association football)|defenders]]. As with any attacking player, the role of the forward relies heavily on being able to create space for attack.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Michalak |first1=Joakim |title=Identifying football players who create and generate space |url=http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&c=30&af=%5B%5D&searchType=LIST_LATEST&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&query=&language=en&pid=diva2%3A1687971&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&sf=all&aqe=%5B%5D&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&noOfRows=50&dswid=6728 |publisher=Uppsala University Publications |access-date=22 August 2022 |archive-date=8 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408114248/http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?aq2=&#91;&#93;&#93;&c=30&af=&#93;&searchType=LIST_LATEST&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&query=&language=en&pid=diva2:1687971&aq=&#93;&sf=all&aqe=&#93;&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&noOfRows=50&dswid=6728 |url-status=live }}</ref> Their advanced position and limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals on behalf of their team than other players.

Attacking positions generally favour direct players who take on the defense of the opponent in order to create scoring chances, where they benefit from a lack of predictability in attacking play. [[Formation (association football)|Modern team formations]] normally include one to three forwards. For example, the common [[Formation (association football)#4–2–3–1|4–2–3–1]] includes one forward.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/09/03/fifa-2010-technical-report-summary/|title=FIFA's 289-page Technical Report on the 2010 World Cup – in 15 points|access-date=17 August 2013|first=Michael|last=Cox|date=3 September 2010|archive-date=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104193726/http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/09/03/fifa-2010-technical-report-summary/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Less conventional formations may include more than three forwards, or sometimes none.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/19/barcelona-4-2-4-formation-guardiola-messi/|title=Is Barcelona's alternative shape really a 4–2–4?|access-date=17 August 2013|first=Michael|last=Cox|date=19 March 2010|archive-date=21 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221152436/http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/19/barcelona-4-2-4-formation-guardiola-messi/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/05/teams-of-the-decade-5-roma-2007/|title=Teams of the Decade #5: Roma, 2007|access-date=17 August 2013|first=Michael|last=Cox|date=5 March 2010|archive-date=26 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190726020823/http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/05/teams-of-the-decade-5-roma-2007/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Centre-forward==

A multi-functional forward, he has influenced a generation of strikers who followed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smyth|first1=Rob|title=Ronaldo at 40: Il Fennomen's legacy as greatest ever No 9, despite dodgy knees|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/17/ronaldo-40-birthday-brazil-greatest-ever-striker|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 September 2016|access-date=9 September 2018|archive-date=7 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907161434/https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/17/ronaldo-40-birthday-brazil-greatest-ever-striker|url-status=live}}</ref>]]

The traditional shirt for centre-forwards is number 9. The traditional role is to score the majority of goals on behalf of the team. 

If they are tall and physical players, with good heading ability, the player may also be used to get onto the end of crosses, win [[long ball]]s, or receive passes and retain possession of the ball with their back to goal as [[Team sport|teammates]] advance, in order to provide depth for their team or help teammates score by providing a pass ('through ball' into the [[Penalty area (football)|box]]), the latter variation usually requiring quicker pace and good movement, in addition to finishing ability. Most modern centre-forwards operate in front of the second strikers or central attacking midfielders, and do the majority of the ball handling outside the box. The present role of a centre-forward is sometimes interchangeable with that of an [[attacking midfielder]] or second striker, however, especially in the 4–3–1–2 or 4–1–2–1–2 formations. The term centre-forward is taken from the earlier football playing [[Formation (association football)|formations]], such as the 2–3–5, in which there were five ''forward'' players: two [[outside forward]]s, two [[inside forward]]s, and one centre-forward. The term "target forward" is often used interchangeably with that of a centre-forward, but usually describes a particular type of striker, who is usually a tall and physically strong player, who is adept at heading the ball; their main role is to win high balls in the air, hold up the ball, and create chances for other members of the team, in addition to possibly scoring many goals themselves. However, the two terms are not necessarily synonymous, with the target forward having developed into a more specialised role, while the centre-forward description is more broad, encompassing many types of forwards.<ref name="targetManRef1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportslingo.com/sports-glossary/t/target-man/|title=Target Man Definition In Soccer - Meanings & Examples From SportsLingo.com|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|language=en-US|archive-date=25 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225225916/http://www.sportslingo.com/sports-glossary/t/target-man/|url-status=live}}</ref>

When [[Squad number (association football)|numbers]] were introduced in the 1933 [[1933 FA Cup Final|English FA Cup final]], one of the two centre-forwards that day wore the number 9 – [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]'s [[Dixie Dean]], a strong, powerful forward who had set the record for the most goals scored in a season in [[Football in England|English football]] during the 1927–28 season. The number would then become synonymous with the centre-forward position (only worn that day because one team was numbered 1–11 whilst the other was numbered 12–22).<ref name=sports.yahoo.com>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/mystery-solved--why-do-the-best-soccer-players-wear-no--10-052229677.html|title=Mystery solved: Why do the best soccer players wear No. 10?|publisher=Yahoo|author1=Khalil Garriot|date=21 June 2014|access-date=19 May 2015|archive-date=26 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626005732/https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/mystery-solved--why-do-the-best-soccer-players-wear-no--10-052229677.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Striker==
[[File:Omar Batistuta.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Gabriel Batistuta]] holding his old number 9 [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] jersey. The number most associated with the position, he was an out and out striker.]]
The role of a striker is rather different from that of a traditional centre-forward, although the terms centre-forward and striker are used interchangeably at times, as both play further up the field than other players, while tall, heavy and technical players, like [[Marco Van Basten]], [[Oliver Bierhoff]], and [[Edin Džeko]], have qualities which are suited to both positions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/15115/10303502/zlatan-ibrahimovic-to-manchester-united-what-will-he-bring |title=Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Manchester United: What will he bring? &#124; Football News |work=Sky Sports |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |access-date=7 August 2016 |archive-date=1 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230501234145/https://www.skysports.com/football/news/15115/10303502/zlatan-ibrahimovic-to-manchester-united-what-will-he-bring |url-status=live }}</ref> Like the centre-forward, the traditional role of a striker is to score goals; strikers are therefore known for their ability to peel off defenders and to run into space via the blind side of the defender and to receive the ball in a good goalscoring position, as typified by [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], [[Andriy Shevchenko]] and [[Thierry Henry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/detail/article/luis-suarez-a-centre-forward-with-a-difference |title=News |publisher=FC Barcelona |access-date=7 August 2016 |archive-date=18 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518173031/http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/detail/article/luis-suarez-a-centre-forward-with-a-difference |url-status=live }}</ref> They are typically fast players with good ball control and dribbling abilities. Shorter statured, more agile strikers like [[Michael Owen]], [[Romário]], [[Dries Mertens]], [[Sergio Agüero]], and [[Paulo Dybala]] have an advantage over taller defenders due to their short bursts of speed.

Good strikers should be able to [[Shooting (association football)|shoot]] confidently with either foot, possess great power and accuracy, and have the ability to link-up with teammates and pass the ball under pressure in breakaway situations. While many strikers wear the number 9 shirt, such as [[Alan Shearer]], an out and out striker, the position, to a lesser degree, is also associated with the [[Squad number (association football)|number 10]], which is frequently worn by more creative deep-lying forwards such as [[Pelé]], and occasionally with numbers 7 and 11, which are often associated with wingers.<ref name="sports.yahoo.com" />

==Second striker==

Deep-lying forwards or second strikers have a long history in the game, but the terminology to describe their playing activity has varied over the years. Originally such players were termed inside forwards, creative or deep-lying centre-forwards ("sub forwards"). More recently, the role has occasionally been colloquially referred to as the centre-forward role, however, two more variations of this old type of player have developed: the second, or shadow, or support, or auxiliary striker and, in what is in fact a distinct position unto its own, the number 10;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afootballreport.com/post/9738165711/the-essence-of-the-number-10-a-beginners-guide|title=The Essence of the Number 10: A Beginner's Guide|website=Afootballreport.com|access-date=12 January 2015|archive-date=27 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227011047/https://afootballreport.com/post/9738165711/the-essence-of-the-number-10-a-beginners-guide|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Mancini: THE NUMBER 10">{{cite web|url=http://www.robertomancini.com/en/calciatore-2/il-numero-10.html|title=THE NUMBER 10|publisher=www.robertomancini.com|last=Mancini|first=Roberto|access-date=8 December 2018|archive-date=30 November 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221130131930/https://www.robertomancini.com/en/calciatore-2/il-numero-10.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="question"/> the former role is exemplified by players such as [[Dennis Bergkamp]] (who would play just behind the striker [[Thierry Henry]] at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/thierry-henry-arsenal-most-premier-league-assists-season-200203-van-nistelrooy-golden-boot |title=Thierry Henry's assist record of 2002/03: how Arsenal's talisman reinvented the Premier League striker |publisher=FourFourTwo |last1=Haugstad |first1=Thore |date=25 October 2019 |access-date=21 January 2020 |archive-date=12 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200612061722/https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/thierry-henry-arsenal-most-premier-league-assists-season-200203-van-nistelrooy-golden-boot |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Alessandro Del Piero]] at [[Juventus FC|Juventus]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2006/agosto/23/Del_Piero_mezzo_Come_Baggio_ga_10_060823083.shtml |title="Del Piero è un 9 e mezzo" Come Baggio per Platini |trans-title="Del Piero is a 9 and a half" Like Baggio was for Platini |work=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=it |last1=Luca |first1=Curino |date=23 August 2006 |access-date=9 January 2020 |archive-date=25 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201125120509/http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2006/agosto/23/Del_Piero_mezzo_Come_Baggio_ga_10_060823083.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Youri Djorkaeff]] at [[Inter Milan]],<ref name=musica>{{cite news|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1996/10/14/dribbling-tiro-la-musica-di-djorkaeff.html|title=Dribbling e tiro.

The second striker position is a loosely defined and most often misunderstood description of a player positioned in a free role, somewhere between the out-and-out striker, whether the player is a "target man" or more of a "poacher", and the number 10 or attacking midfielder, while possibly showing some of the characteristics of both. In fact, a term coined by French advanced playmaker [[Michel Platini]], the "nine-and-a-half", which he used to describe the playing role of his successor in the number 10 role at Juventus, Italian playmaker [[Roberto Baggio]], has been an attempt to become a standard in defining the position.<ref>{{cite web |title=AdTech Ad Roberto Baggio:&#124; 'Allenare l'Italia?

This player should also be able to position themselves well in order to receive passes and subsequently either create or finish off a goalscoring opportunity. They should also be capable of finishing well with either foot as well as their head (which is less common, seeing as many second strikers are diminutive creative players),<ref name="alla Zidane"/> as this will lead to a good scoring percentage on attempts on goal and give their team an advantage offensively. Although they are often deployed in a free role, and given "license to roam", and either run forward or drop further back in order to pick up the ball in deeper areas, giving them more time and space in possession, second or support strikers do not tend to get as involved in the orchestration of attacks as the number 10, nor do they bring as many other players into play, since they do not share the burden of responsibility, functioning mostly in a supporting role as [[Assist (football)|assist]] providers.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197254.stm |title=Positions guide: Behind the striker |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=21 June 2008 |date=1 September 2005 |archive-date=29 December 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051229161022/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197254.stm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/96186/rise-seconda-punta |title=Rise of the Seconda Punta |publisher=Football Italia |last1=Murray |first1=Greg |date=29 December 2016 |access-date=9 January 2020 |archive-date=26 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126181115/https://www.football-italia.net/96186/rise-seconda-punta |url-status=live }}</ref> In [[Italy national football team|Italy]], this role is known as a "rifinitore", "mezzapunta", or "seconda punta",<ref name="Platini: Baggio, Il Fu Nove E Mezzo">{{cite web|url=http://www.eatsport.net/2012/roberto-baggio-il-nove-e-mezzo/ |title=Platini: Baggio, Il Fu Nove E Mezzo |language=it |access-date=16 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604152313/http://www.eatsport.net/2012/roberto-baggio-il-nove-e-mezzo/ |archive-date=4 June 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://dizionari.corriere.it/dizionario_italiano/M/mezzapunta.shtml |title=mezzapunta |work=Il Corriere della Sera |language=it |access-date=21 May 2020 }}</ref> whereas in [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], it is known as "segundo atacante"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Guimarães|first1=Levy|title=Segundo atacante: uma posição em desuso|url=http://doentesporfutebol.com.br/2013/06/segundo-atacante-uma-posicao-em-desuso/|website=Doentes por Futebol|access-date=13 August 2016|date=2 June 2013|archive-date=27 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227011038/https://doentesporfutebol.com.br/2013/06/segundo-atacante-uma-posicao-em-desuso/|url-status=dead}}</ref> or "ponta-de-lança".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://footballsgreatest.weebly.com/second-strikers.html|title=The Greatest Second Strikers / Inside Forwards of All Time|access-date=5 January 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206074856/http://footballsgreatest.weebly.com/second-strikers.html|archive-date=6 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Inside forward==
[[Image:2-3-5 (pyramid).svg|thumb|2–3–5 formation: the inside forwards (red) flank the centre-forward.]]
The position of inside forward was popularly used in the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries. The inside forwards would support the centre-forward, running and making space in the opposition defense, and, as the passing game developed, supporting him with passes. The role is broadly analogous to the ''[[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|"hole"]]'' or ''second striker'' position in the modern game, although here, there were two such players, known as inside right and inside left.

[[Image:Football Formation - WM.png|thumb|left|WM formation: the inside forwards (red) occupy a more withdrawn position supporting the centre-forward and outside right and left.]]
In early [[Formation (association football)#2–3–5 (Pyramid)|2–3–5 formations]] the inside-forwards would flank the centre-forward on both sides. With the rise of the [[Formation (association football)#WM|WM formation]], the inside forwards were brought back to become attacking midfielders, supplying balls to the centre-forward and the two attacking [[Winger (sports)|outside forwards]] – known as the ''outside right'' and ''outside left''. In Italian football jargon, the inside forward was initially occasionally known as a ''[[Midfielder#Mezzala|mezzala]]'' (literally "half-winger", not to be confused with [[wing-half]]); however, the use of this particular term to describe inside forwards is now obsolete, as the ''mezzala'' label was later reapplied to describe the role of offensive-minded [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielders]] in Italian football, while the inside forward role was instead labelled as "interno" ("internal", in Italian) in Italian football in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/127534/just-what-mezzala |title=Just what is a mezzala? |publisher=Football Italia |last1=Tallarita |first1=Andrea |date=4 September 2018 |access-date=3 January 2020 |archive-date=31 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731234253/https://www.football-italia.net/127534/just-what-mezzala |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/italian-english/mezzala |title=English translation of 'mezzala' |publisher=Collins Dictrionary |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=2 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210702093232/https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/italian-english/mezzala |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/alessandro-mazzola_%28Enciclopedia-dello-Sport%29/ |title=MAZZOLA, Alessandro (Sandro) |publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport (2002) |language=it |last1=Garanzini |first1=Gigi |access-date=21 May 2020 |archive-date=31 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731192614/http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/alessandro-mazzola_%28Enciclopedia-dello-Sport%29/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In today's game, inside forwards have been pushed up front to become either out-and-out attackers or [[#False 9|false-9s]], or out wide to wingers (in a [[Formation (association football)#4–3–3|4–3–3 formation]]), or they have even been switched to a deeper position in which they are required to drop back to link-up with the midfield, while also supporting another striker playing alongside them up front (in a [[Formation (association football)#4–4–2|4–4–2]] formation). Many teams still employ one of their strikers in this latter more withdrawn role as a support forward for the main striker, in a role broadly similar to the inside forward.

==Outside forward==

<!-- linked from redirects [[Outside forward]], [[outside left]], [[outside right]] -->
[[File:Metodo (ENG).png|thumb|[[Vittorio Pozzo]]'s ''Metodo'' system from the 1930s featured attacking wingers or outside forwards.]]

An outside forward plays as the advanced forward on the right or left wing – as an outside right or outside left, typically as part of a [[Formation (association football)#2–3–5 (Pyramid)|2–3–5 formation]] or one of its variants. As football tactics have largely developed, and wingers have dropped back to become [[midfielder]]s, the terminology has changed and "outside forward" has become a historical term. Many commentators and football analysts still refer to the wing positions as "outside right" and "outside left". Such players in the modern era have been labelled "wing forwards", particularly when the two wingers play high up the pitch in a 4–3–3 or similar formation, where the front 3 attacking players have 3 central midfielders behind them. A wing forward who is known for cutting inside and shooting can have the term "inverted winger" used interchangeably.

The responsibilities of an outside forward include but are not limited to:
* Scoring: their first option should be to shoot, while their second option should be to find another way to create a goal opportunity for the team.
* Passing: when they run into a shooting angle that is unlikely to become a goal, they must find a way to pass the ball to the middle of the penalty box area allowing the centre-forwards to finish the job.
* Crossing: a main job of outside players, or players in the wide areas, especially forwards is their ability to cross the ball to the middle of the field in front of the goal for the central players to score from

Due to these responsibilities some of the most important attributes include:
* Good dribbling and circumventing defenders
* Speed as a necessity to produce effective counter-attacks
* Technical ability to strike a ball
* Quickness in deception to pass a defender 
* Striking technique to get on the end of crosses from wide players of the opposing side

==Winger==
{{main|Midfielder#Winger}}

[[File:Ronaldo vs. FC Schalke 04 (16854146922).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cristiano Ronaldo]] has been deployed as an inverted winger.]]
A winger is an offensive player located in a wide position near the touchlines. They can be classified as forwards, considering their origin as the old "outside-forward" position, and continue to be termed as such in most parts of the world, especially in Latin and Dutch football cultures. However, in the British game (in which the 4–4–2 formation and its variants are most commonly used) they are usually counted as part of the midfield.

It is a winger's duty to beat opposing [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-backs]], deliver cut-backs or [[Cross (association football)|crosses]] from wide positions and, to a lesser extent, to beat defenders and score from close range. They are usually some of the quickest players in the team and usually have good dribbling skills as well. In Dutch, Spanish and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] usage, the defensive duties of the winger have been usually confined to pressing the opposition fullbacks when they have the ball. Otherwise, a winger will drop closer to the midfield to make themself available, should their team win back the ball.

[[File:Mohamed Salah Ghaly.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|An inverted winger, [[Mohamed Salah]] plays on the right wing, a position which allows him to cut inside to his stronger left foot.]]
In British and other northern European styles of football, the wide-midfielder is expected to track back all the way to their own corner flag should their full-back require help, and also to track back their marker, as well as tucking into the midfield when the more central players are trying to pressure the opposition for the ball. This is a large responsibility for attack-orientated players, and particularly those like [[Joaquín (footballer, born 1981)|Joaquín]] (winger/wide midfielder), or [[Ryan Giggs]] (winger/striker), and [[John Barnes]] (winger/central midfielder), who lack the physical attributes of a wing-back or of a more orthodox midfield player. As these players grow older and lose their natural pace, they are frequently redeployed as "number 10s" between the midfield and the forward line, where their well-honed ball control, technical skills, ability to create chances, and improved reading of the game in the final third can serve to improve their teams' attacking options in tight spaces. An example is [[Inter Milan]]'s use of veteran [[Luís Figo]] behind one or two other attackers, either as a second striker or in a playmaking role as an attacking midfielder.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197228.stm |title=Positions guide: Wide Midfield |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=21 June 2008 |date=1 September 2005 |archive-date=21 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921223945/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197228.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>

In recent years there has been a trend of playing [[Inverted Winger|inverted wingers]] – wide players stationed on the 'wrong' side of the pitch, in order to enable them to cut inside and [[Shooting (association football)|shoot]] on their stronger foot and sometimes provide in-swinging crosses. This tactic was used by [[Frank Rijkaard]], who, whilst at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], moved [[Lionel Messi]] from the left flank onto the right wing, initially against the player's wishes. This allowed him to cut into the centre and shoot or cross with his left foot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lionel Messi |work=Financial Times |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/cfa0d296-8672-11e0-9d5c-00144feabdc0.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108185001/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/cfa0d296-8672-11e0-9d5c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1xRQZ4Y00 |archive-date=8 January 2015 |url-access=subscription |url-status=bot: unknown |access-date=12 January 2015 |date=27 May 2011 |last=Reng |first=Ronald }}</ref> Another example of a successful inverted winger partnership was [[Bayern Munich]]'s pairing of the left-footed [[Arjen Robben]] alongside the right-footed [[Franck Ribéry]], on the right and left flanks respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/ribery-alaba-aubameyang-mkhitaryan-de-bruyne-dost-telepathic-partnerships-472644.jsp |title=Robbery, Aubameyang and Mkhitaryan and the Bundesliga's Top 10 telepathic understandings |publisher=Bundesliga |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=21 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211121055059/https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/ribery-alaba-aubameyang-mkhitaryan-de-bruyne-dost-telepathic-partnerships-472644.jsp |url-status=live }}</ref>

A description that has been used in the media to label a variation upon the inverted winger position is that of an "attacking", "false", or "goalscoring winger", as exemplified by [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and [[Gareth Bale]]'s roles on the left and right flank during their time at Real Madrid in particular. This label has been used to describe an offensive-minded inverted winger, who will seemingly operate out wide on paper, but who instead will be given the freedom to make unmarked runs into more advanced central areas inside the penalty area, in order to get on the end of passes and crosses and score goals, effectively functioning as a [[#Striker|striker]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/real-madrid/86/blog/post/3418861/cristiano-ronaldo-evolving-into-an-effective-striker-for-real-madrid |title=Cristiano Ronaldo evolving into an effective striker for Real Madrid |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Dunne |first1=Robbie |date=14 March 2018 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=25 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210825222345/https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/real-madrid/86/blog/post/3418861/cristiano-ronaldo-evolving-into-an-effective-striker-for-real-madrid |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/ronaldo-vs-messi-case-ronaldo-worlds-greatest-player/ |title=Ronaldo vs. Messi: the case for Ronaldo as world's best player |publisher=Sportsnet |last1=Molinaro |first1=John |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=27 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627033937/https://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/ronaldo-vs-messi-case-ronaldo-worlds-greatest-player/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/125639/cristiano-ronaldos-rise-real-madrid |title=Cristiano Ronaldo's rise at Real Madrid |publisher=Football Italia |last1=Driscoll |first1=Jon |date=2 August 2018 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910110637/https://football-italia.net/125639/cristiano-ronaldos-rise-real-madrid |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.co.uk/football/club/real-madrid/86/blog/post/2824537/real-madrid-prepare-for-a-post-cristiano-ronaldo-era |title=Are Real Madrid ready for life without Cristiano Ronaldo? |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Goodman |first1=Mike |date=8 March 2016 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910110635/https://www.espn.co.uk/football/club/real-madrid/86/blog/post/2824537/real-madrid-prepare-for-a-post-cristiano-ronaldo-era |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/name/93/post/1839626/headline |title=Bale and Ronaldo comparisons not so ridiculous |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Laurence |first1=Martin |date=11 February 2013 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910112137/https://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/name/93/post/1839626/headline |url-status=live }}</ref> This role is somewhat comparable to what is known as the ''raumdeuter'' role in German football jargon (literally "space interpreter"), as exemplified by [[Thomas Müller]], namely an attacking-minded wide player, who will move into central areas in order to find spaces from which he can receive passes and score or assist goals.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/thomas-muller-the-most-under-appreciated-player-in-football-raumdeuter-bayern-munich-9945 |title=Thomas Müller: the most under-appreciated player in world football |publisher=bundesliga.com |access-date=15 August 2021 |archive-date=2 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231002110923/https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/thomas-muller-the-most-under-appreciated-player-in-football-raumdeuter-bayern-munich-9945 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The "false winger" or "seven-and-a-half" is instead a label which has been used to describe a type of player who normally plays centrally, but who instead is deployed out wide on paper; during the course of a match, however, they will move inside and operate in the centre of the pitch, in order to drag defenders out of position, congest the midfield and give their team a numerical advantage in this area, so that they can dominate possession in the middle of the pitch and create chances for the forwards; this position also leaves space for full-backs to make overlapping attacking runs up the flank. [[Samir Nasri]], who has been deployed in this role, once described it as that of a "non-axial playmaker".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/name/93/post/1839728/headline |title=Roberto Soldado perfectly anchors AVB's 'vertical' football |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Cox |first1=Michael |date=6 August 2013 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910110642/https://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/name/93/post/1839728/headline |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/english-premier-league/23/blog/post/2998241/manchester-united-must-play-paul-pogba-in-his-best-position-to-get-the-most-from-him |title=Man United must play Paul Pogba in best position to get the most from him |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Cox |first1=Michael |date=18 November 2016 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910122303/https://www.espn.com/soccer/english-premier-league/23/blog/post/2998241/manchester-united-must-play-paul-pogba-in-his-best-position-to-get-the-most-from-him |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/man-united-meet-henrikh-mkhitaryan-one-man-arsenal-wholl-give-your-attack-a-new-lease-life |title=Man United, meet Miki: The one-man arsenal who'll revitalise your attack |publisher=FourFourTwo |last1=Baldi |first1=Ryan |date=1 July 2016 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=1 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211201193521/https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/man-united-meet-henrikh-mkhitaryan-one-man-arsenal-wholl-give-your-attack-a-new-lease-life |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-england-liverpool-united/analysis-soccer-van-gaals-tactical-wits-edge-battle-of-the-bosses-idUKL3N0WN0AT20150322 |title=ANALYSIS-Soccer-Van Gaal's tactical wits edge battle of the bosses |work=Reuters |last1=Davis |first1=Toby |date=22 March 2015 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910110635/https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-england-liverpool-united/analysis-soccer-van-gaals-tactical-wits-edge-battle-of-the-bosses-idUKL3N0WN0AT20150322 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/long-read-guardiolas-16-point-blueprint-dominance-his-methods-management-and-tactics |title=The long read: Guardiola's 16-point blueprint for dominance - his methods, management and tactics |publisher=FourFourTwo |last1=Murray |first1=Andrew |date=16 August 2016 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910110635/https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/long-read-guardiolas-16-point-blueprint-dominance-his-methods-management-and-tactics |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@Discussion_Dave/julian-weigl-the-modern-day-regista-3586684bf2cc |title=Julian Weigl: The Modern Day Regista |publisher=Medium |last1=Ndiyo |first1=David |date=3 August 2017 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=26 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211026153726/https://medium.com/@Discussion_Dave/julian-weigl-the-modern-day-regista-3586684bf2cc |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2511694-the-tactical-evolution-of-arsenal-midfielder-santi-cazorla |title=The Tactical Evolution of Arsenal Midfielder Santi Cazorla |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=McNicholas |first1=James |date=1 July 2015 |access-date=17 May 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910110641/https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2511694-the-tactical-evolution-of-arsenal-midfielder-santi-cazorla |url-status=live }}</ref>

On occasion, the role of an offensive winger can also be occupied by a different type of player. For example, certain managers have been known to use a "wide target man" on the wing, namely a large and physical player who usually plays as a centre-forward, and who will attempt to win aerial challenges and hold up the ball on the flank, or drag full-backs out of position. [[Jostein Flo]] epitomizes this role so much so that a tactic was named after him – [[Flo Pass]]. [[Egil Olsen]], while managing the [[Norway national football team]], positioned Flo, usually a centre-forward, on the right flank to exploit the opposition full-backs' lack of aerial abilities. Another example is [[Mario Mandžukić]], a natural centre-forward, who was used on the left flank under manager [[Massimiliano Allegri]] at Juventus during the 2016–17 season, as well as the following season. Unlike wide target men of earlier eras, Mandžukić was also tasked with pressing opposing players.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-champions-juv-mandzukic/versatile-mandzukic-becomes-juves-secret-weapon-idUKKBN1860YF |title=Versatile Mandzukic becomes Juve's secret weapon |work=Reuters |last1=Homewood |first1=Brian |date=10 May 2017 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910110637/https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-champions-juv-mandzukic/versatile-mandzukic-becomes-juves-secret-weapon-idUKKBN1860YF |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Romelu Lukaku]] has also been used in this role on occasion.<ref name="FM1">{{cite news |url=https://medium.com/@v_maedhros/understanding-roles-in-football-manager-and-real-life-part-1-73054cfbb303 |title=Understanding roles in Football Manager (and real life) (part 1) |work=Medium |date=13 May 2018 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=31 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731234408/https://medium.com/@v_maedhros/understanding-roles-in-football-manager-and-real-life-part-1-73054cfbb303 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==False 9==
[[File:Leo_Messi_v_Granada_2014.jpg|thumb|[[Lionel Messi]] (front, no. 10) has been used in the false 9 position to much success throughout parts of his career.]]
A ''false 9'', similar to a more advanced attacking midfielder/playmaker role, is an unconventional lone striker or centre-forward, who drops deep into midfield. The purpose of this is that it creates a problem for opposing [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-backs]] who can either follow the false 9, leaving space behind them for onrushing midfielders, forwards or wingers to exploit, or leaving the false 9 to have time and space to dribble or pick out a pass. The term comes from the traditional number for centre-forwards (nine), and the fact that normally a centre-forward traditionally stayed near the line of [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] until they got an opportunity to move past them toward goal.<ref name="thefalse9.com">{{cite web|title=Football Tactics for Beginners: The False 9|url=http://www.thefalse9.com/2013/09/football-tactics-for-beginnersthe-false.html|website=The False 9 – Football Tactics Simplified|date=20 December 2014|access-date=17 January 2017|archive-date=17 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191017120945/https://www.thefalse9.com/2013/09/football-tactics-for-beginnersthe-false.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Key attributes for a false 9 are similar to those of a deep-lying striker: dribbling ability to take advantage of space between the lines, good short passing ability to link up with the midfield and vision to play through teammates making runs from deep to goal.

The first false 9 in a World Cup was [[Juan Peregrino Anselmo]] in the [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay national team]], although he could not play the match against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930 World Cup]] due to injury.

The [[Revie Plan]] was a variation on the tactics used by the Hungarians, involving [[Don Revie]] playing as a deep-lying centre-forward. Revie started attacks by coming into the centre of the field to receive the ball, drawing the opposing [[centre-half]] out of position. The role can also be compared to the false role in which Hidegkuti operated. The system was first implemented by the Manchester City reserve team. They used the system and went unbeaten for the last 26 games of the [[1953–54 in English football|1953–54]] season. Before the start of the [[1954–55 in English football|1954–55]] season, Manchester City manager [[Les McDowall]] called his team into pre-season training two weeks early to try the new tactic. Manchester City lost their first game using the system 5–0, but as the players got more used to the system, it started to become more successful. Manchester City used the system to help them reach the [[1955 FA Cup Final]], but they lost to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] 3–1. The following year, City again reached the final where they played [[Birmingham City]], this time winning 3–1.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/name/93/post/1841124/headline |title=A change of formation |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Smith |first1=Rory |date=19 February 2014 |access-date=17 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/may/13/manchester-city-don-revie |title=The Revie final: how the Don glowed quietly for Manchester City |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 May 2011 |access-date=1 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/latest-leeds-united-news/30-years-leeds-united-legend-don-revie-remembered-pictures-480907 |title=30 years on - Leeds United legend Don Revie remembered in pictures |work=Yorkshire Evening Post |last1=Hay |first1=Phil |last2=Urquhart |first2=Joe |date=26 May 2019 |access-date=17 June 2020 |archive-date=17 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200617114246/https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/latest-leeds-united-news/30-years-leeds-united-legend-don-revie-remembered-pictures-480907 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Throughout his career, [[Johan Cruyff]] was often deployed in a free role as a centre-forward with Ajax, Barcelona, and the Netherlands in the 1970s in [[Rinus Michels]]'s fluid 1–3–3–3 formation, which was a key and trademark feature of the manager's ''[[Total Football|total football]]'' system. Although Cruyff was a prolific goalscorer in this position, he also frequently dropped deep to confuse his markers and orchestrate attacks, or moved out onto the wing to create space for other teammates' runs, which has led certain pundits to compare this role retroactively as a precursor to the modern false 9 role.<ref name="false9History" /><ref name="false9Best"/><ref name="Turn">[https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/11/world-cup-stunning-moments-johan-cruyff-turn-1974 "World Cup: 25 stunning moments ...

[[Michael Laudrup]] was occasionally used as a lone centre-forward in Johan Cruyff's Barcelona ''Dream Team'', a role which was similar to that of the modern false 9 role.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/brendan-rodgers-aims-follow-pep-2833794 |title=Rodgers aims to follow Guardiola on Johan Cruyff's path |work=Leicester Mercury |last1=Blackwell |first1=Jordan |date=5 May 2019 |access-date=10 October 2021 |archive-date=10 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211010171921/https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/brendan-rodgers-aims-follow-pep-2833794 |url-status=live }}</ref>

At [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]], [[Spain men's national football team|Spain]] manager [[Vicente del Bosque]], although sometimes deploying [[Fernando Torres]] as a traditional striker, often used [[Cesc Fàbregas]] as a false 9 in several matches, including [[UEFA Euro 2012 Final|the final]]. By the end of 2012, the false 9 had gone "mainstream" with many clubs employing a version of the system. Barcelona's [[Lionel Messi]] has been an epitome of the false 9 position to much success in recent years, first under coach [[Pep Guardiola]] and later under his successor [[Tito Vilanova]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/dec/18/football-tactical-trends-of-2012 |title=5 The football tactical trends of 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=8 January 2019 |archive-date=9 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109062445/https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/dec/18/football-tactical-trends-of-2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Brazilian forward [[Roberto Firmino]] was later also successfully used in the false 9 position under manager [[Jürgen Klopp]] at Liverpool.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/what-makes-liverpool-tick-club-world-cup|title=FIFA Club World Cup 2019 – News – What makes Liverpool tick? – FIFA.com|last=FIFA.com|website=www.fifa.com|access-date=}}</ref>

One approach to stop false 9s has been to create congestion in the midfield by bringing several players back into a more defensive role in an attempt to deny them space needed to create plays, notably in [[José Mourinho]]'s "parking the bus" strategy.<ref name="thefalse9.com"/>

In Italian football jargon, this role is historically known as the ''centravanti di manovra'' (which literally translates to "manoeuvring centre-forward"), due to the player's tendency to move freely and participate the build-up of attacking plays.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://torino.corriere.it/sport/19_dicembre_04/dopo-belotti-b-toro-berenguer-1668ae5c-16c9-11ea-b17e-02f19725a806.shtml |title=Dopo Belotti, la B del Toro è Berenguer |work=Il Corriere della Sera |language=it |last1=Balice |first1=Nicola |date=4 December 2019 |access-date=9 April 2020 |archive-date=31 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031222628/https://torino.corriere.it/sport/19_dicembre_04/dopo-belotti-b-toro-berenguer-1668ae5c-16c9-11ea-b17e-02f19725a806.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.tuttosport.com/news/calcio/serie-a/2019/12/04-64146061/la_riscoperta_del_vero_n_9/ |title=La riscoperta del vero n.9 |work=Tutto Sport |language=it |last1=Vocalelli |first1=Alessandro |date=4 December 2019 |access-date=9 April 2020 |archive-date=31 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731232058/https://www.tuttosport.com/news/calcio/serie-a/2019/12/04-64146061/la_riscoperta_del_vero_n_9/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Target forward==
[[File:Tymoshchuk Drogba.jpg|thumb|left|[[Didier Drogba]] (blue, no. 11), who often played as a target forward throughout his career, was known for his ability to hold up the ball, as demonstrated during the [[2012 UEFA Champions League final]] against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]].]]
The term "target forward" or "target man" or "target striker" is often used to describe a particular type of striker or centre-forward whose main role is to win high balls in the air, hold up the ball, and create chances for other members of the team in addition to scoring goals themselves.<ref name="targetManRef1"/> These players are usually tall and physically strong, adept at heading the ball, and capable of playing with their back to goal in the final third of the pitch. Some of the most high-profile examples of this type of players in modern football include [[Olivier Giroud]] and [[Fernando Llorente]], both [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] winners, with the former having played the entire [[2018 FIFA World Cup|tournament]] as a starting line-up forward tasked primarily with pressing, counter-pressing, winning high or loose balls, and providing key passes to quicker and more agile teammates, namely [[Antoine Griezmann]] or [[Kylian Mbappé]]. Another example of a striker who played in this position is [[Didier Drogba]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1242375-didier-drogba-my-tribute-to-the-chelsea-fc-legend |title=Didier Drogba: Striker's Time in Chelsea Was Special |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=Li |first1=Martin |date=30 June 2012 |access-date=15 May 2021 |archive-date=15 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210515183542/https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1242375-didier-drogba-my-tribute-to-the-chelsea-fc-legend |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1207048-didier-drogba-5-reasons-real-madrid-shouldnt-sign-the-ivorian |title=Didier Drogba: 5 Reasons Real Madrid Shouldn't Sign the Ivorian |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=Nolan |first1=Ryan |date=6 June 2012 |access-date=15 May 2021 |archive-date=15 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210515183542/https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1207048-didier-drogba-5-reasons-real-madrid-shouldnt-sign-the-ivorian |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/30/didier-drogba-chelsea |title=The real Didier Drogba is back, mean and motivated for Chelsea |work=The Guardian |last1=Fifield |first1=Dominic |date=29 April 2011 |access-date=15 May 2021 |archive-date=15 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210515183542/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/30/didier-drogba-chelsea |url-status=live }}</ref> However, not any tall or physically strong player feels comfortable in the role of a "target man", despite having all the necessary features. Such forwards as [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]], [[Romelu Lukaku]], and [[Erling Haaland]] have all rejected the term when applied to specifically them, with Ibrahimović preferring to be described as an attacking all-rounder, while Lukaku and Haaland have said to favour poaching goals rather than physical play.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/haaland-fjortoft-interview-hat-trick-on-dortmund-debut-english-transcript-9401 |title=Watch: Erling Haaland's interview with Jan Age Fjortoft after his Borussia Dortmund debut hat-trick heroics |publisher=Bundesliga |access-date=21 June 2021}}</ref>

As stated above, the target forward is a player who does not run or look to make runs as compared to other forwards. Typically they are strong, tall, and physical players. Usually, the build-up play of a target forward will often consist of one of the following options: firstly, the goalkeeper will either launch a long kick or distribute the ball to a central defender or full-back. From there, the [[Defender (association football)|defender]] will play a long ball to the striker, either in the air or ground. The target forward usually has perfected their ability to provide first touches of the ball on all areas of the body. They will control the ball and provide holdup, which allows their teammates to transition forward. From here, they may create more opportunities such as passing the ball backwards and creating space by moving around defenders, making combination plays with a "false 9", midfielders, or wingers, or turning and facing the goal and attempting to score by dribbling or shooting.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Robyn |title=Soccer Strategies: Defensive and Attacking Strategies |last2=Tranter |first2=Tom |publisher=Library of Congress |year=1999 |isbn=1-890946-32-X}}</ref> Because of their strength and physicality, target forwards may be defended against by [[Marking (association football)|man-to-man marking]]. Sometimes the central defender of the opposing team will be of similar strength and height, which makes the matchup more evenly based. Due to this man-to-man marking, target forwards are often fouled and receive many calls from the referee.

==Striker combinations==

Strike teams consist of two or more strikers who work together. The history of football has been filled with many effective combinations. Three-man teams often operate in "triangles", giving a wealth of attacking options. Four-man packages expand options even more. Strikers must also be flexible, and be able to switch roles at a moment's notice, between the first (''advanced penetrator position''), second (''deep-lying manoeuvre'') and third (''support and expansion, e.g. wings'') attacker roles.

Another example was the [[Total Football]] played by the Dutch team in the 70s, where the ability of their players, and in particular [[Johan Cruyff]], to swap positions allowed a flexible attacking approach which opposition teams found difficult to effectively mark.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150930160041/http://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=1043/profile.html "FIFA Classic Player: Cruyff. The Netherlands' Grand Master"]. FIFA.com. Retrieved 13 August 2018</ref>

In a two-player front line, it is common for two forwards who complement one another to be paired together; for example, former Italy manager [[Cesare Maldini]] often used a large, physical, and prolific player as a traditional [[#Centre-forward|centre-forward]] – such as [[Christian Vieri]] – alongside a smaller, faster, creative and more technical player as a [[#Second striker|second striker]] – such as Roberto Baggio or Alessandro Del Piero.<ref name="alla Zidane">{{cite news|url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,27/articleid,0550_01_1998_0161_0031_7340355/|title=Robi "alla Zidane"|last=Beccantini|first=Roberto|work=La Stampa|language=it|date=14 June 1998|page=27}}</ref>

== Defensive capabilities ==
Although the striker is mainly an offensive position in many cases, they still play critical roles for defense that are often overlooked. Strikers can be involved in tactics such as high-pressing, cutting out passing lanes, defending set pieces, and tracking back (mostly for wingers). For high-pressure, this tactic is employed when the opposing team without the ball will defend the team all the way to their back line of defenders so that they have little area to pass or perform play buildup. Strikers will usually be at the forefront of this high-pressing movement and will attempt to direct ball movement. As part of this high-pressing technique, they can also cut out passing lanes. This means that they will position their bodies in-between an outside defender and central defender or midfielders and center defenders so that the opposing player is not able to pass the ball or make a play. By performing this method, they can effectively force the opposing team to one area of the pitch and create better opportunities for the opposing team to turn the ball over. They are heavily used in the "delay, coverage, balance, and concentration principles of football" through a variety of methods. According to the delay principle of defense in football is the idea that players should disturb the ball holder and block passing lanes, which is done in high-pressing and closing down. Closing down is the ability of a player to very quickly start defending the opposing player with the ball. This usually falls under the concentration principle of football, so strikers must be able to start defending the opposing team very high up in the opposing half.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Matsuoka |first1=Hiroki |last2=Tahara |first2=Yasuhiro |last3=Ando |first3=Kozue |last4=Nishijima |first4=Takahiko |date=2020 |title=Development of Criterion-referenced Measurement Items for Soccer Defensive Tactical Play from Tracking Data |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jssfenfs/17/0/17_29/_article |access-date=15 October 2023 |journal=Football Science|volume=17 |doi=10.57547/jssfenfs.17.1_29 }}</ref> Although many believe strikers are not very involved in defensive strategies, they greatly help with "gathering defense to protect vital zones from progression of offensive actions, direct play to less vital zones, and allow for a regain of ball possession."<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Mota |first1=Tomás |last2=Silva |first2=Rui |last3=Clemente |first3=Filipe Manuel |date=2023 |title=Holistic soccer profile by position: a theoretical framework |url=https://www.termedia.pl/Holistic-soccer-profile-by-position-a-theoretical-framework,129,45625,1,1.html |access-date=15 October 2023 |journal=Human Movement |volume=24 |pages=4–20 |doi=10.5114/hm.2023.110751 |s2cid=244650565 |doi-access=free |archive-date=3 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203061724/https://www.termedia.pl/Holistic-soccer-profile-by-position-a-theoretical-framework,129,45625,1,1.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
