In the sport of [[cricket]], the '''corridor of uncertainty''' is an area where a cricket ball can pitch during a [[Delivery (cricket)|delivery]]: a narrow line on and just outside a batsman's off stump. The name is derived from the opinion that this is the area in which a [[batsman]] struggles most to determine whether to play forward or back, or to leave the delivery. If a batsman leaves the ball, there is a chance the ball will turn inward and either [[Bowled|bowl]] him or hit him with an increased chance of [[leg before wicket]]. If a batsman plays the ball, there is a chance the ball will go to the outside instead, leading to an outside edge that can be [[caught]] by the [[Slip (cricket)|slip fielders]] or [[wicketkeeper]].

The phrase was popularised by former [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] and [[English cricket team|England]] [[batsman]], now [[sports commentator|commentator]], [[Geoffrey Boycott]] whilst commentating on England's 1990 tour of the West Indies.<ref>{{Citation | last=Greenslade | first=Nick | title=First and last: Geoffrey Boycott | newspaper=The Observer  | date=4 July 2004 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/jul/04/cricket.features2 }}</ref> But he did not invent the cricketing use of the term that is seen at least from the 1980s.

For instance while describing the [[The Gabba|Brisbane]] Test of the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1986–87|1986-87 Ashes]] in [[The Age]], [[Peter Roebuck]] writes of [[Graham Dilley]] bowling "down the corridor of uncertainty" and explains that "this American phrase" is used for "bowling on or outside the offstump".<ref>[[Peter Roebuck|Roebuck, Peter]], [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/97010559/roebuckcorridor/ ''England turns to a team at last''], 20 November 1986, [[The Age]] (via newspapers.com)</ref> According to [[Mike Selvey]], Dilley in [[New Zealand cricket team in Australia in 1987–88|New Zealand a year later]], "sent ball after ball relentlessly down the "corridor of uncertainty" just outside the offstump, from which batsmen are drawn into the shot without the security of the leaving option, all to a good length".<ref>[[Mike Selvey|Selvey, Mike]], [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/97010949/selveycorridor/ ''Rejuvenated Dilley finds his corridor of power''], 16 February 1988, [[The Guardian]] (via newspapers.com)</ref> Some writers attribute the term to [[Terry Alderman]].<ref>Blake, Martin, [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/97011233/blakecorridor/ ''Test win hopes soar''], 11 July 1989, The Age (via newspapers.com)</ref><ref>Thicknesse, John, [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/97011367/ ''Ellison is the man to put wind up Aussies''], 10 May 1989, [[Evening Standard]] (via newspapers.com)</ref>

The phrase has also been used in other sports commentary. In [[football (soccer)|football]] it is commonly used to describe a [[cross (football)|cross]] or pass which is delivered into the area in front of the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] and behind the last line of [[Defense (sport)|defence]]. The "uncertainty" in this case comes from the decision which both the last defender and the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] must make: whether to defend the ball, or leave it to the other player.

"Corridor of uncertainty" is also the name, or part of the name, of several online cricket forums and at least two [[fanzine]]-type cricket publications.
