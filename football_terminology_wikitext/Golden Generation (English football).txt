The players of the [[England national football team]] in the 2000s have been referred to as a [[golden generation]]. Despite the talent of its players and their success at club level, the Golden Generation has been known as underachievers, being eliminated at the quarter-finals in three major tournaments and failing to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2008]].<ref name=nyt>{{cite news |title=England's 'golden generation' shows feet of clay |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/23/sports/23iht-soccer.4.8457225.html |access-date=23 October 2023 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=23 November 2007}}</ref>

The term "Golden Generation" was coined in 2001 by [[The Football Association]] chief executive [[Adam Crozier]], and criticised as a burden by players such as [[Frank Lampard]].<ref name=lampard/> Reasons offered by pundits and players for the failure of the team have included arrogance,<ref name=wilson/><ref name=williams/> tactical inflexibility,<ref name=talk/><ref name=four/> the incapability of Lampard and [[Steven Gerrard]] to perform together in [[midfield]],<ref name=talk/><ref name=four/> and the lack of an assertive manager.<ref name=gerrard/>

==History==
On 1 September 2001, England [[2001 Germany v England football match|won 5–1]] away to [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in a [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifier]]. The unexpected victory eventually saw England qualify automatically at the expense of the Germans, though England were eliminated in the quarter-finals and Germany reached the [[2002 FIFA World Cup final|final]], both losing to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. Following the game, [[the Football Association]] chief executive [[Adam Crozier]] referred to the team as a golden generation, and the game has been referred to as the start of the generation.<ref name=four>{{cite news |last1=Flanagan |first1=Chris |title=What happened to England's "Golden Generation"?

England failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2008]], a first qualification failure since the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. Upon sacking manager [[Steve McClaren]], [[The Football Association|Football Association]] board member Brian Mawhinney said "I've been brought up over the last few years believing that this was the golden generation, but I have to tell you, if this is the golden generation, the sooner we move away from the gold standard the better".<ref name=nyt/> [[BBC Sport]] writer [[Phil McNulty]] wrote that McClaren had been Eriksson's assistant and was therefore unfit to revitalise the team.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McNulty |first1=Phil |title=Where it went wrong for McClaren |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7106870.stm |access-date=23 October 2023 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=22 November 2007}}</ref>

With many of the same players as in 2006, England entered the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] with media optimism that the Golden Generation would succeed.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Molinaro |first1=John F. |title=All Hail Fabio Capello |url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/all-hail-fabio-capello-1.819109 |access-date=23 October 2023 |publisher=[[CBC Sports]] |date=13 November 2009|quote=Indeed, many critics believed that this golden generation of players would wrap themselves in glory in Germany and end the country's lengthy World Cup drought — England has won the World Cup once, in 1966.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=England: Capello dares to dream |url=https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/england-capello-dares-to-dream.311916 |access-date=23 October 2023 |work=[[Times of Malta]] |date=12 June 2010}}</ref> Richard Williams of ''The Guardian'' called the last-16 elimination by [[Germany national football team|Germany]] the "passing" of the Golden Generation that he believed had been born at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]; many key players were retired from international football or past the age of 30. He contrasted the perceived "entitlement" of the players to the team that had won the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=williams>{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Richard |title=World Cup 2010: Golden generation passes on after 12 frustrating years |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jun/28/england-golden-generation-world-cup-2010 |access-date=23 October 2023 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 June 2010}}</ref>

[[Michael Owen]] said in 2021 that tactics were the downfall of the team: he said that the team should have played a 3–5–2 and not 4–4–2 [[Formation (association football)|formation]] due to a strength in central [[Defender (association football)|defence]] and central [[Midfielder|midfield]].<ref name=talk>{{cite news |last1=Cole |first1=Jackson |title=Michael Owen believes tactics in England’s Golden Generation featuring Gerrard and Lampard ‘killed’ them but backs Euro 2020 squad to fare better |url=https://talksport.com/football/851507/michael-owen-england-golden-generation-gerrard-lampard-euro-2020/ |access-date=23 October 2023 |publisher=[[Talksport]] |date=18 March 2021}}</ref> Lampard and [[Steven Gerrard]] were criticised as central midfield partners.<ref name=talk/> Eriksson played [[Paul Scholes]] out of position on the left wing in order to accommodate the pair, and Scholes retired from the team after [[UEFA Euro 2004]], aged 29; journalist [[Henry Winter]] identified the misuse of Scholes as a reason for the team's failure.<ref name=four/> The team was known for a wealth of central defenders including [[John Terry]], [[Rio Ferdinand]], [[Sol Campbell]], [[Jamie Carragher]], [[Ledley King]] and [[Jonathan Woodgate]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brewin |first1=John |title=Traditional centre-back a dying breed |url=https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/37351977/traditional-centre-back-dying-breed |access-date=23 October 2023 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=30 May 2014}}</ref> Gerrard said in 2020 that the team failed because managers were incapable of getting the best out of the team, offering [[Rafael Benítez]] as a hypothetical alternative.<ref name=gerrard>{{cite news |last1=Fordham |first1=Josh |title=‘We needed a manager who was bigger than the players’ – Steven Gerrard blames England ‘golden generation’ failings on FA appointments |url=https://talksport.com/football/735946/england-managers-steven-gerrard-golden-generation-failings/ |access-date=23 October 2023 |publisher=[[Talksport]] |date=22 July 2020}}</ref>
