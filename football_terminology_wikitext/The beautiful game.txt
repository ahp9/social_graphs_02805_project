'''''The beautiful game''''' ({{langx|pt|o jogo bonito}}, {{IPA|pt-BR|u ˈʒoɡu boˈnitu|pron}}) is a nickname for [[association football]]. It was popularised by Brazilian footballer [[Pelé]], who played from 1957 to 1977. It was a term widely used in Brazil, though the exact origin of the phrase is disputed. [[Stuart Hall (presenter)|Stuart Hall]], an English football commentator, used it in 1958. Hall admired [[Peter Doherty (footballer)|Peter Doherty]] when he went to see [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] play at [[Maine Road]] and used the term ''the beautiful game'' to describe football as a whole.<ref>{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Nick|date=2 May 2003|title=Stuart Hall|work=The Guardian|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/may/02/newsstory.sport11|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402072207/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/may/02/newsstory.sport11|archive-date=2 April 2019|quote=The player I fell in love with and who inspired me to coin the phrase 'the beautiful game' was Peter Doherty, an inside forward, my first hero.|access-date=24 April 2011}}</ref> During his career, the Brazilian footballer [[Ronaldinho]] was an exponent of the ''jogo bonito'' ('nice game' or 'cute game') style of play.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ronaldinho's Biography |date=9 March 2020 |url=https://rioandlearn.com/ronaldinho/}}</ref> Although made famous around the world, the phrase ''jogo bonito'' in Brazil has been replaced with ''futebol-arte'' ("Art Football") which means the same.
