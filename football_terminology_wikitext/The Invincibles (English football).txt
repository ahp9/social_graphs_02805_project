[[File:Preston north end art.jpg|thumb|381x381px|The [[1888–89 Football League|1888–89 season]] was [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]'s first season in the [[Football League]] (and the first edition of the championship); they went on to claim the league and [[FA Cup]] double without being defeated, which earned the squad legendary status.]]

The "Invincibles" nickname was first coined in 1883, long before the [[1888–89 Football League|inaugural Football League competition]]. The term was used by the press in attempt to sneer or devalue Preston's achievements at the time due to the club's unpopular [[Professional sports|professional status]]; Preston was one of the first sides in England to pay footballers to play for the club and the side was very successful under Sudell before the Football League.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Clayton |first=David |title=The Preston North End Miscellany |date=2010 |publisher=The History Press |isbn=9780752458762 |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire |pages=43–44}}</ref> After Preston played [[Upton Park F.C.|Upton Park]] in the FA Cup in January 1884, their opponents reported the club for fielding a professional side to the [[The Football Association|Football Association]], and Preston were subsequently disqualified from the competition.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS168609340/TTDA |title=The Association Challenge Cup |newspaper=[[The Times]] |publication-place=London |issue=31041 |page=10 |date=1884-01-28 |access-date=2024-12-20 |via=The Times Digital Archive}}</ref>

After they won the inaugural Football League competition in 1888–89, the nickname returned in a commemorative capacity; completing the season unbeaten in both the [[The Football League|league]] and the [[1888–89 FA Cup|FA Cup]], so becoming the first team ever to achieve the "[[Double (association football)|Double]]". Preston's league record was 18 wins, 4 draws, and 0 losses out of 22 games played, while in the FA Cup they won all 5 of their matches without conceding a single goal.<ref name="Agnew">{{cite book | last=Agnew | first= Paul | title=Football Legend: Tom Finney | publisher=Milo Books | year=2002 | orig-year=1989 | pages=53–55 | isbn=0-9530847-9-5}}</ref> Preston achieved this with a squad primarily composed of Scottish players, part of a wave of Scottish footballers in England who became known as the [[Scotch Professors]].<ref name="scotsman2">{{cite web |author=Aitken, Mike |date=22 March 2008 |title=Scots passing pioneers shaped football |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/football/Scots-passing-pioneers-shaped-football.3905190.jp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306005853/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/football/Scots-passing-pioneers-shaped-football.3905190.jp |archive-date=6 March 2011 |access-date=9 February 2009 |website=The Scotsman |publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Barrett |first=Michael |date=19 February 2019 |title=The Scottish Professors and their role in football's first Invincibles |url=https://www.nutmegmagazine.co.uk/issue-4/the-scottish-professors-and-their-role-in-footballs-first-invincibles/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124004527/https://www.nutmegmagazine.co.uk/issue-4/the-scottish-professors-and-their-role-in-footballs-first-invincibles/ |archive-date=24 November 2020 |access-date=26 September 2020 |website=Nutmeg Magazine}}</ref>

[[1889–90 Football League|The following season]], Preston won their first league match to stretch their unbeaten league run to 23 games; in their second game they suffered their first-ever league defeat against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], losing 5–3.<ref>{{cite web |title=Preston North End match record: 1890 |url=http://www.11v11.com/teams/preston-north-end/tab/matches/season/1890 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310080258/http://www.11v11.com/teams/preston-north-end/tab/matches/season/1890/ |archive-date=10 March 2016 |access-date=11 August 2015 |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises}}</ref> In his autobiography, [[Tom Finney]] wrote: "The championship stayed with North End – by now tagged the Old Invincibles – the following year, but runners-up spot had to suffice for the next three seasons".<ref>{{cite book | last=Finney | first=Tom | author-link=Tom Finney | title=Tom Finney – My Autobiography | page=113 | year=2003 | publisher=Headline Publishing | location=London | isbn=0-7553-1106-X}}</ref>

Of the eight teams to have completed the Double in England, Preston remain the only one to have done so unbeaten. In 2008, Preston opened a new 5,000 seater stand at their [[Deepdale]] stadium, named the Invincibles Pavilion in honour of the unbeaten 1880s team that had also played their home matches at the same site.<ref name="Deepdale">{{cite web|title=Deepdale|url=http://www.pnefc.net/page/Deepdale/0,,10362~1033873,00.html|publisher=Preston North End FC|date=15 February 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126163821/http://www.pnefc.net/page/Deepdale/0%2C%2C10362~1033873%2C00.html|archive-date=26 November 2009}}</ref>

In comparison to their rivals [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], bankrolled by new owner [[Roman Abramovich]], and Manchester United, Arsenal's transfer activity was quiet.

In the [[2003–04 FA Premier League|2003–04]] season, Arsenal regained the Premier League without a single defeat. Over the 38 games played, their league record stood at 26 wins, 12 draws and no defeats. The unbeaten run came close to ending six matches into the campaign [[Battle of Old Trafford|against Manchester United]], as striker [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] missed a penalty in injury time; the match then ended 0–0. At the turn of the calendar year, Arsenal won nine league matches in a row to consolidate first position; they secured their status as champions with a draw against local rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in April 2004. Their form did not continue into the domestic cups; Arsenal exited the semi-final stage of the Football League Cup and the FA Cup to eventual winners [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], respectively.

Of the players from Arsenal's [[1997–98 Arsenal F.C. season|double-winning side of 1998]], only [[Patrick Vieira]] and [[Dennis Bergkamp]] remained as first team players throughout the unbeaten run; [[Martin Keown]] featured briefly, while [[Ray Parlour]] made 25 league appearances. Defenders [[Lee Dixon]] and [[Tony Adams]] had retired from professional football in 2002 and goalkeeper [[David Seaman]] joined Manchester City a year later. [[Kolo Touré]], signed as a right-back and defensive midfielder, was chosen to play in central defence alongside [[Sol Campbell]] after impressing during pre-season. [[Lauren (Cameroonian footballer)|Lauren]], who had played as a midfielder for [[Real Mallorca]], was shifted to right-back when he joined Arsenal. Wenger initially replaced left-back [[Nigel Winterburn]] with [[Sylvinho]], but an injury to the defender allowed [[Ashley Cole]] to take his place as first pick by the [[2000–01 Arsenal F.C. season|2000–01 season]]. In midfield [[Gilberto Silva]] partnered Vieira, with [[Freddie Ljungberg]] and [[Robert Pires]] playing either side of them on the wings. [[Thierry Henry]], signed as [[Nicolas Anelka]]'s replacement in 1999, was the team's focal point in attack; he was supported most often by Bergkamp.

Although the team were interpreted as one who organised themselves in a [[Formation (association football)#4–4–2|4–4–2]], their formation with the ball was closer to a [[Formation (association football)#4–4–1–1|4–4–1–1]]. Wenger's tactics emphasised attacking football and relied on movement and interchanging, with full-backs joining in attacks. Journalist [[Michael Cox (journalist)|Michael Cox]] noted that Arsenal's strengths lay on the left side of the pitch, and added that, because the opposition focused on containing Cole, Pires, and Henry, this allowed Lauren and Ljungberg to find space for crosses. Arsenal were also strong on the counter-attack, exemplified in their away performances against Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur.<ref>{{cite news |title=Henry torments poor Leeds |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/nov/02/match.sport |newspaper=The Observer |location=London |first=Ian |last=Ridley |date=2 November 2003 |access-date=19 August 2014 |archive-date=12 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912141931/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/nov/02/match.sport |url-status=live }}</ref>
