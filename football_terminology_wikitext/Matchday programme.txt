A '''matchday programme''' or '''match programme''' is a [[Programme (booklet)|booklet associated with a live sporting event]] which details the proposed [[starting lineup]] and other details of the match. To some spectators, the purchase of a matchday programme is part of the "ritual" of attending football and hurling matches in Britain and Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/01/traditional-programme-demise-memories-threatened | website = [[The Guardian]] | title = Demise of the match-day programme threatens treasured memories | date = 1 May 2018 | accessdate = 8 June 2021 | quote = For many fans, though, there is, and never will be, anything quite like a programme in its most traditional form – on paper and on sale outside of the ground.

[[Souvenir programme]]s are also collected as [[sports memorabilia]], and rare [[FA Cup Final]] matchday programmes have fetched in excess of [[Pound sterling|£]]35,000 at auction houses such as [[Sotheby's]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/your-old-football-programmes-could-14470411 | publisher = Birmingham Mail | website = birminghammail.co.uk | title = Why your old football programmes could be worth a small fortune! | date = 15 February 2019 | accessdate = 8 June 2021 }}</ref><ref name="bbc2013">{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-22532857 | publisher = BBC News | website = bbc.com | title = 1882 FA Cup final programme sells for world record price | date = 14 May 2013 | accessdate = 8 June 2021 }}</ref> Matchday programmes from early 20th-century [[hurling]] and [[Gaelic football]] games are also collected in Ireland,<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.independent.ie/life/home-garden/treasures-the-clash-of-the-cash-31278361.html| publisher = Independent News & Media | website = independent.ie | title = Treasures: The clash of the cash | date = 4 June 2015 | accessdate = 8 June 2021 | quote = medals, tickets and programmes, from early matches are highly collectible [..] The 1926 All-Ireland football final was notable for torrential rain, which probably explains why programmes of the match are so rare.

==Association football==
Among the traditions in attending a league or cup [[Association football|football]] match in Britain is the purchase of a matchday programme.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://talksport.com/football/1235404/demise-matchday-programme-premier-league-efl-wsl/ | website = talksport.com | title = The demise of the matchday programme | first = Bradley | last = Hayden | date = 4 November 2022 | accessdate = 19 January 2024 }}</ref> Due to their initial expendable nature (like the ticket) it took many decades for the format to gain respectability as a collectible. Collecting football programmes became a common hobby among fans in Britain during the 1960s and a number of specialist dealers subsequently began to appear.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cox|name-list-style=amp|last2=Vamplew|title=Encyclopedia of British Football|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0714652498|location=UK|page=241}}</ref>

===History===
[[File:QPWanderers.jpg|thumb|Programme for an association football match played at [[Hampden Park]], Glasgow on 9 October 1875 between home side [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] and the [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] from London. It mentions the visiting club first and identifies individual players not by jersey numbers but by the colours of their stockings or caps.]]
One of the earliest matchday programmes recorded, for an 1873 football match between alumni representatives of [[Eton College]] (in England) and [[Yale College]] (in the US), was reputedly sold in 2016 for £15,000.<ref>{{cite book | title = Origin Stories: The Pioneers Who Took Football to the World | chapter = The Genesis of Soccer in the US | first = Chris | last = Lee | isbn = 9781785319235 | publisher = Pitch Publishing | date = 2021 | quote = A match took place on 6 December 1873 between alumni of the English school Eton and American college Yale [..] The four-page matchday programme, also one of the earliest recorded, sold at aution for £15,000 in 2016 }}</ref>

In English league football, matchday programmes were used from the late 1880s as a scorecard which would have been a single card or sheet with dateline, team names, player positions and advertising. [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] team [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] were one of the first clubs to publish a programme, ''The Villa News and Record'', which was printed in the form of a journal with a different number and volume for each season and week respectively.{{fact|date=January 2024}}

Of particular interest for UK collectors is the FA Cup Final programme. The covers of FA Cup Final matchday programmes have had designs which reflected the age, with the late 1920s and 1930s covers bearing [[Art Deco]] styles, for example.{{fact|date=January 2024}} Programmes from the 1940s and early 1950s are rarer due to recycling for paper shortages as part of the war effort and times of post-war austerity. The size of the programmes increased over the decades from a smaller pocket size to a larger [[A4 paper|A4]] size, but a number of clubs in the early 21st century have reverted to more convenient sizes. The FA Cup Final programme has, however, retained its larger size (customarily being sold with a carrier bag for this reason).{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

While, until the 1950s, programmes produced by individual clubs were typically limited to team sheets and advertising, some clubs started to introduce "more sophisticated" magazine formats.<ref>{{cite book | title = When Saturday Comes | date = 2006 | isbn = 9780141927039 | publisher = Penguin Books Limited | chapter = Programmes | quote = Early programmes remained little more than a collage of team sheets and crude advertisements until the 1950s, which saw the gradual introduction - pioneered by clubs such as Chelsea and, later, Coventry City - of more sophisticated magazines }}</ref> Modern programmes have more pages than their four or eight-page predecessors and are often full colour and glossy. 

In June 2018, clubs in the [[English Football League]] voted to end the requirement for programmes to be produced for every game.<ref name="compulsory"/> A decline in sales was attributed to the proliferation of [[smartphones]] which allowed fans to access team information easily.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/the-matchday-programme-can-it-survive-the-digital-age-1.3525857|title=The matchday programme: can it survive the digital age?|first=Ruaidhrí|last=Croke|website=The Irish Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/07/the-end-of-an-era-football-programmes-outdated-or-great-pieces-of-history|title=The end of an era: football programmes – outdated or great pieces of history?|first=Elis|last=James|date=7 February 2022|via=The Guardian}}</ref>

===Notable programmes and collecting===
Some clubs have a programme shop for collectors.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

One of the most sought-after of all programmes is the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final]]. There have been at least two reprints — with the original being heavier than the reprints at 130 grams — and the inside advert for Player's No. 6 is different. The blue of the [[Union Jack|Union Flag]] on the cover is darker too.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

The programme for the first ever [[FA Cup Final]] held in [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] in [[1923 FA Cup Final|1923]] is rarer than the 1966 programme, and would typically cost over £1000.{{fact|date=January 2024}} The programme for the [[1924 FA Cup Final]] is also rare; the game was played in torrential rain and fans used their programmes as part of their effort to cover themselves against the weather. An example, offered at auction in 2017, was estimated at between £3,500 and £4,500.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/rare-4500-newcastle-united-fa-12956923 | website = chroniclelive.co.uk | title = The rare £4,500 Newcastle United FA Cup final programme that will get Toon fans seeing red | first = Mike | last = Kelly | date = 28 April 2017 | accessdate = 19 January 2024 }}</ref>

Following the [[Munich air disaster]] in February 1958, Manchester United's planned game against Wolverhampton Wanderers was cancelled and a majority of programmes that had been printed were destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-67906099 | work = BBC | title = Manchester United programme for Munich air disaster abandoned game at auction | date = 7 January 2024 | accessdate = 19 January 2024 }}</ref> One of the rare surviving examples of this matchday programme was sold in 2024 for £7,500.<ref>{{cite press release | url = https://hansonsauctioneers.co.uk/one-of-worlds-rarest-manchester-united-football-programmes-is-top-of-the-league-under-the-hammer/ | publisher = Hansons Auctioneers | title = One of world's rarest Manchester United football programmes is top of the league under the hammer | date = 12 January 2024 | accessdate = 19 January 2024 }}</ref> Another notable Manchester United programme is the example printed in February 1958 for the FA Cup game between Manchester United and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].{{fact|date=January 2024}} This was the club's first game after the Munich air disaster and the team layout was left blank.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/1958-man-utd-programme-of-first-match-after-munich-air-disaster-is-now-available-to-view-digitally | website = manutd.com | title = Read a Poignant Piece of United History | date = 18 February 2023 | accessdate = 19 January 2024 }}</ref>

A football programme from the [[1882 FA Cup Final]] between [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]] sold at auction for a world record of £35,250.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.maturetimes.co.uk/one-expensive-football-programmes-ever-sold/|title=One of the most expensive football programmes ever sold|work=Mature Times|date=5 June 2014|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref> The programme was sold by Sotheby's in May 2013 to Old Etonians Football Club.

It was sold in a 2012 auction for £23,500.<ref name="bbc2013"/>

The programme for the [[1973 European Cup Final]] between [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] is also rare, with only 400 produced.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-44656118|title=Football programme dealer Steve Earl selling million programmes|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=1 July 2018|accessdate=1 July 2018}}</ref>
