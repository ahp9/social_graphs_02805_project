In [[association football]], the '''FIFA eligibility rules''' are the eligibility criteria established by [[FIFA]] (International Association Football Federation), the sport's governing body, to facilitate the selection of representative teams for international competitions.<ref name="fifa.com 2021 e961">{{Cite web |title=FIFA publishes explainer on eligibility to play for representative teams |website=fifa.com |date=2021-01-28 |url=https://www.fifa.com/legal/media-releases/fifa-publishes-explainer-on-eligibility-to-play-for-representative-teams |access-date=2023-07-23}}</ref> Specifically, FIFA maintains and implements rules determining a player's eligibility to [[Sporting nationality|represent a particular national team]] in officially sanctioned international competitions and friendly matches.<ref name="fifa.com 2021 e961"/>

Traditionally, athlete eligibility has been tied to legal nationality, allowing players with multiple nationalities to represent more than one country, especially after naturalisation. However, national teams are organised by national football associations, not all of which are affiliated with FIFA.<ref name="fifa.com 2021 e961"/> Some countries, like the United Kingdom, are represented by constituent associations (England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland), while other associations represent regions not typically recognized as independent countries, such as dependent territories (e.g., [[Gibraltar]]), autonomous states or territories (the [[Faroe Islands]]), or even independent countries with disputed recognition ([[Kosovo]] and [[Palestine]]). Not all countries have a FIFA-affiliated association.<ref name="fifa.com 2021 e961"/>

In 2004, FIFA introduced a rule requiring players to demonstrate a "clear connection" to any country they wish to represent, in response to the [[Qatar Football Association]] offering incentives to uncapped players with no links to the country to play for [[Qatar national football team|their national team]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Fifa rules on eligibility |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/3498082.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=18 March 2004 |access-date=17 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124060318/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/3498082.stm |archive-date=24 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> FIFA has the authority to overturn results of international matches featuring ineligible players. In January 2021, FIFA revamped the eligibility system, allowing players tied to one nationality the option to switch allegiance to another nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://robbinsathletics.com/fifa-eligibility-rule-changes-2004-2021/|title=FIFA Eligibility Rules: The 2004 Crackdown and the 2021 Nationality Switch Reform |date=10 April 2025 }}</ref>

Fielding ineligible players can lead to sanctions, including the overturning of match results.

==History==
Historically, it was possible for players to play for different national teams. For example, [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]] played for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (1947) and [[Spain national football team|Spain]] (1957–61).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rsssf.org/miscellaneous/distefano-intl.html|title=Alfredo Di Stéfano Laulhé - International Matches|access-date=2 September 2016|website=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]}}</ref>

Di Stefano's Real Madrid teammate [[Ferenc Puskás]] also played for Spain after amassing 85 [[Cap (sport)|cap]]s for [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] earlier in his career.<ref name=guardian/> A third high-profile instance of a player switching international football nationalities is [[José Altafini]], who played for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] and for [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the subsequent [[1962 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/gattusos-avengers-alert-to-a-rafa-repeat-447637.html|title=Gattuso's avengers alert to a Rafa repeat|date=6 May 2007|access-date=27 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/timvickery/2010/04/immigrant_pride_and_workingcla.html|title=Immigrant pride and working-class thrift|date=12 April 2010|access-date=27 July 2011|website=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref>

Other 20th-century examples of players representing two or three separate countries are:
* [[Ernst Wilimowski]] – ([[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Germany national football team|Germany]])<ref name=rsssf1/>
* [[Joe Gaetjens]] – ([[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]])<ref name=rsssf1/>
* [[László Kubala]] – ([[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], Hungary and [[Spain national football team|Spain]])<ref name=guardian/><ref name=rsssf1/>

* [[Luis Monti]] – (Argentina and Italy; the only person who played in two World Cup final matches for two different teams)<ref name=guardian/><ref name=rsssf1/>
* [[José Santamaría]] – ([[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]])<ref name=rsssf1/>
* [[Alberto Spencer]] – ([[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] and Uruguay)<ref name=rsssf1/>
* [[Paulino Alcántara]] – ([[Philippines national football team|Philippines]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]])

This does not include the hundreds of players whose teams were affected by changes to geopolitical borders e.g. [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]]/[[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]]/[[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]/[[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].

Furthermore, some international players have played for another FIFA-recognised country in unofficial international matches, i.e. fixtures not recognised by FIFA as full internationals. This category includes:
*  [[Daniel Brailovsky]], who played for [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] youth teams, was featured in camps for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and years later officially represented [[Israel national football team|Israel]].
* [[Debatik Curri]], an [[Albania national football team|Albania]] international, played in a friendly for [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]] in 2014, during the period when they were allowed to play against full national teams, but were not members of the confederations. He later played again competitively for Albania.<ref>[https://www.national-football-teams.com/player/9433/Debatik_Curri.html Curri, Debatik] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329183123/https://www.national-football-teams.com/player/9433/Debatik_Curri.html |date=29 March 2020 }}, National Football Teams</ref> Other players in that match subsequently switched formally from Albania to Kosovo when they began to play official matches.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dailysabah.com/football/2014/05/22/turkey-beat-kosovo-in-friendly-61/amp |title=International Friendly: Kosovo 1 - 6 Turkey |date=22 May 2014|work=Daily Sabah |access-date=25 July 2020}}</ref>

In January 2004, a new ruling came into effect that permitted a player to represent one country at youth international level and another at senior international level, provided that the player applied before their 21st birthday.<ref name=chassoc /> The first player to do so was [[Antar Yahia]], who played for the [[France national under-18 football team|France under-18s]] before representing [[Algeria national under-23 football team|Algeria]] in qualifiers for the [[2004 Olympic Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/3365795.stm|title=French-born Algerian makes history|date=3 January 2004|access-date=28 July 2011|website=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref> More recent examples include [[Sone Aluko]], who has caps for the [[England national under-19 football team|England under-19s]] and [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]],<ref>{{cite web|url= https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/8068814.stm|title=Kelvin Etuhu opts for Nigeria |date=26 May 2009|access-date=27 July 2011|website=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref> and [[Andrew Driver]], a former [[England national under-21 team|England under-21]] representative who is committed to the Scotland national team.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/more-scottish-football/craig-levein-convinces-hearts-winger-andrew-driver-to-commit-his-international-future-to-scotland-1.1003905|title=Craig Levein convinces Hearts winger Andrew Driver to commit his international future to Scotland|date=5 February 2010|access-date=27 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]}}</ref>

In March 2004, FIFA amended its wider policy on international eligibility. This was reported to be in response to a growing trend in some countries, such as [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] and [[Togo national football team|Togo]], to naturalise players born and raised elsewhere who have no apparent ancestral links to their new country of citizenship.<ref name="Fifa rules on eligibility">{{cite web|url= https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/3523266.stm|title=Fifa rules on eligibility|date=18 March 2004|access-date=12 February 2015|website=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref> An emergency FIFA committee ruling judged that players must be able to demonstrate a "clear connection" to a country that they had not been born in but wished to represent. This ruling explicitly stated that, in such scenarios, the player must have at least one parent or grandparent who was born in that country, or the player must have been resident in that country for at least two years.<ref name="Fifa rules on eligibility"/>

[[File:Togo-nationalmannschaft.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Togo national football team|Togo]]'s registration of [[Naturalization|naturalised]] players born and raised in Brazil reportedly influenced FIFA's decision to amend eligibility rules in 2004.]]
In November 2007, FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] told the BBC: "If we don't stop this farce, if we don't take care about the invaders from Brazil towards Europe, Asia and Africa then, in the 2014 or the 2018 World Cup, out of the 32 teams you will have 16 full of Brazilian players."<ref>{{cite news|title=Blatter wants EU to allow quotas|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/7112767.stm|work=BBC Sport|access-date=29 December 2012|date=26 November 2007}}</ref>

The residency requirement for players lacking birth or ancestral connections with a specific country was extended from two to five years in May 2008 at FIFA's Congress as part of Blatter's efforts to preserve the integrity of competitions involving national teams.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://redsports.sg/2008/11/27/qiu-li-football/|title=National footballer Qiu Li gets tackled from behind by new FIFA law|date=27 November 2008|access-date=4 May 2012|publisher=redsports.sg|archive-date=4 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004034154/http://redsports.sg/2008/11/27/qiu-li-football/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Under the criteria generally, it is possible for a player to have a choice of representing several national teams. It is not uncommon for national team managers and scouts to attempt to persuade players to change their FIFA nationality; in June 2011, for example, Scotland manager [[Craig Levein]] confirmed that his colleagues had started a dialogue with [[United States men's national under-17 soccer team|United States under-17]] international [[Jack McBean]] in an attempt to persuade him to represent Scotland in the future.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/scotland/2011/06/12/craig-levein-wants-us-hitkid-jack-mcbean-to-play-for-scotland-86908-23196390/ |title=Craig Levein wants US hitkid Jack McBean to play for Scotland |newspaper=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|The Sunday Mail]] |date=12 June 2011 |access-date=4 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819022544/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/scotland/2011/06/12/craig-levein-wants-us-hitkid-jack-mcbean-to-play-for-scotland-86908-23196390/ |archive-date=19 August 2011 }}</ref> [[Gareth Bale]] was asked about a possibility to play for [[England national football team|England]], being of English descent through his grandmother, but ultimately opted to represent [[Wales national football team|Wales]], his country of birth.<ref name="england">{{Cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/real-madrids-gareth-bale-rejected-8532079|title = Real Madrid's Gareth Bale: I rejected England to play for Wales|date = 28 January 2015}}</ref>

In June 2009, FIFA Congress passed a motion that removed the age limit for players who had already played for a country's national team at youth level to change national associations.

Under FIFA rules, eligibility by descent is strictly limited to biological descent; [[International adoption|adoption]] is not considered at all. By contrast, [[World Rugby]], the governing body for [[rugby union]], specifies that if a player has been legally adopted under the laws of the relevant country, descent is traced through the adoptive parent(s). This replacement also applies in cases where the player was not adopted, but one or both biological parents were themselves adopted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/handbook/regulations/reg-8/explanatory-guidelines |title=Regulation 8 Explanatory Guidelines |website=World Rugby |date=21 April 2016 |access-date=14 May 2018}}</ref>

In September 2020, the 70th edition of the [[FIFA Congress]] approved a rule change that now allows players to switch 3 years later if they have played no more than three competitive matches at senior level prior to them turning 21 including no appearances in [[FIFA World Cup]] finals matches or continental finals (e.g. the [[UEFA European Championship]]).

FIFA takes punitive action against teams that field ineligible players. In August 2011, FIFA expelled [[Syria national football team|Syria]] from the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] process following the appearance of [[George Mourad]] in a senior qualification match against [[Tajikistan national football team|Tajikistan]].

After the game, a protest was lodged by their opponents [[Vanuatu national football team|Vanuatu]], on the basis that Wynne was not an eligible player. As Wynne was 20 years old, it was impossible for him to have already lived in New Zealand for five years after the age of 18.

==Home nations agreement==
There has been a series of additional agreements between national football associations of the [[United Kingdom]] ([[The Football Association]], the [[Scottish Football Association]], the [[Football Association of Wales]] and the [[Irish Football Association]]), the latest of which came in 2010 and was ratified by [[FIFA]].<ref name="sfa-2010-6-9">{{cite web|title=FIFA approve eligibility rule change|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_fa_news.cfm?page=2986&newsCategoryID=3&newsID=5968|publisher=ScottishFA.co.uk|access-date=19 February 2014|date=9 June 2010}}</ref>

In 1990, [[Nigel Spackman]] wanted to be called up by Scotland during his time at [[Rangers F.C.]] through his Scottish grandfather. However at the time, the four British Associations did not choose to accept players without parents pertaining to the nation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bruce wants to join the foreign legion|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/bruce-wants-to-join-the-foreign-legion-1.594386|work=Herald|access-date=7 October 2013|date=19 January 1990}}</ref> ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' reported that "until recently that would have been enough to give him qualification to play for Scotland. But under an agreement by the four home associations it is not enough any more."

===Foreign-born British nationals===
The agreement is often erroneously thought to be a response to cases similar to [[Maik Taylor]], who was born in Germany to an English father and chose to represent [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] at international level despite having no ties to the nation. Taylor was called up to Northern Ireland in 1998, five years after the 1993 (gentlemen's) agreement was in place.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/taylor-is-still-true-to-northern-ireland-cause-28454962.html |title=Taylor is still true to Northern Ireland cause |first=Stuart |last=McKinley |newspaper=Belfast Telegraph |date=19 November 2008 |access-date=15 October 2021}}</ref> The agreement was not applied when Taylor was called up by the IFA, possibly because in his case, neither the FA, SFA nor FAW was interested in capping him, unlike e.g. [[David Johnson (footballer, born 1976)|David Johnson]] (below) and so raised no objection. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Taylor was eligible to play for Northern Ireland due to FIFA regulations allowing him to. The relevant statute of the time read: "Any player who is a naturalised citizen of a country in virtue of that country's laws shall be eligible to play for a national or representative team of that country." As there is no United Kingdom national team, he was eligible to choose a "representative team of the country" and opted for Northern Ireland. [[Eric Young (footballer, born 1960)|Eric Young]] (born in Singapore) and [[Pat Van Den Hauwe]] (born in Belgium) had both previously opted for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] under the same rules in 1985 and 1990 respectively, although both grew up in England;<ref>[https://www.nsno.co.uk/everton-news/2015/10/pat-van-den-hauwe-kendall-told-pick-wales/ Pat Van den Hauwe: Kendall told me to pick Wales] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211210052350/https://www.nsno.co.uk/everton-news/2015/10/pat-van-den-hauwe-kendall-told-pick-wales/ |date=10 December 2021 }}, Nil Satis Nisi Optimum, 23 October 2015</ref><ref>[https://inparallellines.wordpress.com/2017/11/26/eric-young-went-from-non-league-to-the-international-stage-via-brighton-and-crystal-palace/ Eric Young went from non league to the international stage via Brighton and Crystal Palace] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211027175350/https://inparallellines.wordpress.com/2017/11/26/eric-young-went-from-non-league-to-the-international-stage-via-brighton-and-crystal-palace/ |date=27 October 2021 }}, In Parallel Lines, 26 November 2017</ref> Australian [[Tony Dorigo]] had been denied the chance to play for his birth nation by his club manager at [[Aston Villa]] due to the travelling distances and low standards of opposition, and successfully obtained citizenship in 1986 in order to play for England<ref>[https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/i-had-no-choice-former-leeds-defender-tony-dorigo-explains-why-he-had-to-play-for-england-instead-of-birth-nation-australia "I had no choice" – former Leeds defender Tony Dorigo explains why he had to play for England instead of birth-nation Australia], Ed McCambridge, FourFourTwo, 10 April 2023</ref> – but had no relevant British ancestry and could have represented any of the home nations.

===1993 agreement===
The four associations met on 27 February 1993 at [[Hanbury Manor]] in Hertfordshire. The [[Scottish Football Association]] (SFA) released minutes from the meeting to the press.

{{quotation|
On the occasion of the meeting of the International Football Association Board on 27 February 1993 the four British associations ratified the following agreement, which came into force on 1 February 1993, on the criteria which should determine the eligibility of the player to be selected for one of the national teams of the British associations:

# His country of birth.
# The country of birth of his natural mother or father.
# The country of birth of his natural grandmother or grandfather.
# Where the player, both natural parents, and both natural grandparents are born outside the UK, but the player is the holder of a current British passport, he may play for the country of his choice."<ref name="scottish-no-go">{{cite web|title=Johnson devastated at Scottish no-go|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/scottish/johonson-devastated-at-scottish-nogo-742830.html|work=The Independent|access-date=7 October 2013 |date=4 November 1999}}</ref>|Scottish Football Association}}

David Johnson was a [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]]n international who had played four games for the Caribbean nation; his most recent game was a friendly against United States on 9 September 1999. He had previously played for the England B team and had been an unused substitute for the England under-21s. In late September 1999, the [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] forward was called up by Wales (and withdrew from the squad due to injury) and later Scotland. The Welsh and Scottish FAs believed he was eligible to play for them.<ref name="scottish-no-go"/> Johnson was a Jamaican immigrant who was raised by foster parents in England, and he believed he could choose which UK nation to represent; the (English) Football Association (FA) had advised the player's [[sports agent|agent]] that the international change of allegiance could go ahead.<ref name="here-to-paternity">{{cite web|title=Not quite from here to paternity|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/not-quite-from-here-to-paternity-1.265864|work=Herald|access-date=7 October 2013|date=25 October 1999 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240222220617/https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12210721.not-quite-from-here-to-paternity/ |archive-date= 22 February 2024 }}</ref>

However, the SFA discovered that as he had an English mother, he was not able to represent any Home nation other than England as a result.<ref name="scottish-no-go"/> The SFA had chosen to abide by the agreement; unlike the Irish Football Association (IFA), who in addition to courting David Johnson had capped Germany-born Maik Taylor the previous year. Taylor was in the same situation as Johnson: he was born outside of the UK with one English parent. The Herald reported that "It is important to highlight, that under the agreement signed by the four British associations, the UK passport clause is only operative in the event that the player, his natural mother and father and his natural grandparents, are all born outside the United Kingdom".<ref name="here-to-paternity"/>

A Football Association of Wales (FAW) spokesman Cerri Stennett said that they were "extremely puzzled by this development" and they thought "he was eligible to play for any of the four home countries and that's why Lawrie McMenemy wanted him for Northern Ireland as well." Stennett stated that FIFA gave clearance to Johnson switch allegiance to Wales' national squad and "he was on the substitute's bench for a match."<ref>{{cite web|title=Ipswich attack 'charade' as Johnson is ruled to be English; Coach faces up to the reality that he will be unable to name Jamaican in his squad|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23768868.html |url-access=subscription |first1= Rob |last1=Robertson |via=HighBeam Research |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611071134/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23768868.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 June 2014|publisher=The Herald|access-date=19 February 2014|date=5 November 1999}}</ref>

Under [[Lawrie McMenemy]]'s stewardship, Northern Ireland went through a phase of trying to call up players who had no links to a UK nation, Northern Ireland attempted to call up Germany-born Maik Taylor, Nigeria-born [[Dele Adebola]] and Jamaica-born David Johnson. McMenemy's successor [[Sammy McIlroy]] was not pleased with his predecessor's policy, upon being appointed as Northern Ireland manager he said: "It's farcical chasing players with absolutely no connection to our country."<ref>{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Bill |title=Football: Mac the knife; Sammy slams foreign legion. |via=The Free Library |work=Sunday Mirror |date=9 January 2000 |access-date=27 March 2014 |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FOOTBALL%3A+MAC+THE+KNIFE%3B+Sammy+slams+foreign+legion.-a060959897 }}</ref>

Former FA executive [[David Davies (football administrator)|David Davies]] confirmed that England had once considered calling up Italian [[Carlo Cudicini]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Carlo for England?|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/news/2003/38978 |work=The FA |access-date=14 November 2012|date=7 February 2003 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125034727/http://www.thefa.com/England/news/2003/38978 |archive-date= Nov 25, 2012 }}</ref> Brazilian [[Edu (footballer, born 1978)|Edu]] and Frenchmen [[Steed Malbranque]] and [[Louis Saha]] during [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]]'s time as England manager.

In February 2004, there was a lot of media speculation in Scotland about the possibility of Frenchman [[Didier Agathe]] and Italian [[Lorenzo Amoruso]] playing for Scotland. [[Berti Vogts]], the German head coach of Scotland, appeared to be in favour of fielding the players. Scotland's playing captain [[Christian Dailly]] felt differently, telling the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' newspaper that "I don't care if they call in [[Zinedine Zidane]]. I would rather lose with a team of Scots than win with a team of foreigners. This is not a club side we're talking about it's SCOTLAND...I know the players will definitely be against it".<ref>{{cite news  |last=Jackson |first=Keith |title=I don't care if we bring in Zidane...

Ahead of a meeting with the other home associations, SFA executive [[David Taylor (executive)|David Taylor]] urged caution ahead of calls to opt out of the agreement. He said "We have to watch it does not become a free-for-all with the home countries trying to get the best players available," "It goes to the heart of why we exist as a separate country and could force people into asking why we do not have a UK football team."<ref>{{cite news  |last=Broadfoot |first=Darryl |title=National side at mercy of FIFA proposals Eligibility issue to be decided by home nations pact |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/national-side-at-mercy-of-fifa-proposals-eligibility-issue-to-be-decided-by-home-nations-pact-1.93183 |publisher=Herald & Times Group |work=The Herald |access-date=9 October 2013|date=18 February 2004}}</ref> On 1 March 2004, the four British associations voted to retain the agreement.<ref>{{cite news |last=Broadfoot |first=Darryl |title=Identity crisis not much of a drama |publisher=Herald & Times Group |work=The Herald|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23561873.html |url-access=subscription |via=HighBeam Research |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105214134/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23561873.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 November 2013|date=2 March 2004|access-date=27 March 2014}}</ref>

===2006 agreement===
In January 2006, Northern Ireland manager [[Lawrie Sanchez]] had his hopes of bringing in players born outside Northern Ireland – but who held a British passport – dashed. Irish FA chiefs told Sanchez he could only select players who have a history with Northern Ireland. Sanchez spoke of his frustration with the rule: "I must stick by the British agreement which says that you shouldn't approach a player unless he has family ties with that particular country.

"It's frustrating but my job is to manage the Northern Ireland international team and theirs (the [[Irish FA]]) is to make policy.

"I must continue to work with the players I have and I'm very happy to do that.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/quick-on-the-draw-28253118.html|title=Quick on the draw

The wording of the agreement was adjusted and published by FIFA in December 2006:<ref name="FIFA Transfer Commentary"/>

'''3. British associations'''

# There is a specific agreement, stipulating the conditions to play for a national team, for the four British associations<sup>134</sup>. Besides having British nationality, the player needs to fulfil at least one of the following conditions
#: a) he was born on the territory of the relevant association;
#: b) his biological mother or father was born on the territory of the relevant association;
#: c) his grandmother or grandfather was born on the territory of the relevant association.
# If a player has a British passport, but no territorial relationship as provided for in conditions a-c above, he can choose for which of the British associations he wants to play<sup>135</sup>.
<small>134 England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.<br />135 e.g. a player who was born on the Cayman Islands and holds British nationality</small>}}

In October 2008, Spanish striker [[Nacho Novo]] said that he would apply for a British passport if it meant he'd become eligible to play for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. The SFA stated that he would not be eligible as they would abide by the agreement.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7702704.stm |date = 31 October 2008|publisher=BBC |work=[[BBC Sport]] |access-date=23 December 2013 |title=Deal ends Novo's Scotland hopes}}</ref>

===2009 agreement===
The agreement was completely revised in 2009 following a rewrite of the FIFA statutes in 2008. The loophole regarding British players born abroad and selecting a national team had been closed and then reopened. The revised ruling also removed the possibility of ineligibility due to a foreign-born adopted player having no parental or grand-parental links to a nation, as it is based on where the player is educated before the age of 18.<ref>{{Cite web |title=What's In A Nationailty Anyway?

====Removal of residency clause====
The home nations have agreed to remove a clause that enables players to gain eligibility for one of the eight national teams due to residency. The FIFA statutes state that "Associations sharing a common nationality may make an agreement under which item (d) of par. 1 of this article is deleted completely or amended to specify a longer time limit". The clause removed is:

{{quote|(d) He has lived continuously on the territory of the relevant Association for at least two years|sign=FIFA Statutes (April 2016 edition)<ref name="statutes"/>}}

If the home nations' associations had chosen not to remove or alter the 'd' clause and instead use the default FIFA statute clauses, players with a home nation nationality would be able to transfer to a club in another home nation and be eligible for that national team after a period of two years (providing they have not been capped or played in an ''official'' competition for a nation).

====The education clause====
In February 2009, the Scottish FA's Gordon Smith put forward a proposal that would allow players educated in the FA's territory who otherwise had no blood connections to the nation to become eligible to represent the nation. The rule was ratified by FIFA in October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shuttleworth|first=Peter|title=Shawcross now eligible for Wales|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8302195.stm|publisher=BBC|access-date=14 November 2012|date=13 October 2009}}</ref>

In June 2010, FIFA approved a minor rewording of the criteria.<ref name="sfa-2010-6-9"/> The introduction of the new clause allows a player to gain eligibility for a British national team if he receives five years of education in the territory of the relevant association:

{{quote|d) He has engaged in a minimum of five years education under the age of 18 within the territory of the relevant association.|Home nations agreement}}

As a direct result of the clause change, England-born [[Andrew Driver]] became eligible to play for the Scotland national team in June 2012. Driver was initially only eligible to represent England's national team despite living in Scotland since the age of 11.<ref>{{cite news|title=Andrew Driver receives Scotland eligibility boost|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/8731562.stm|work=BBC Sport|access-date=1 February 2012}}</ref> Despite speculation, Driver was never called-up for Scotland. [[Andy Dorman]], who had previously been ineligible for Wales despite living in [[Hawarden]] for most of life became eligible to represent Wales. He was called up in November 2009 and made his debut for Wales on 23 May 2010 against Montenegro at the [[Stadion kraj Bistrice]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_of_wales/8678876.stm |title=Croatia 2–0 Wales |date=23 May 2010 |access-date=23 May 2010 |work=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref>

The criteria for eligibility to represent a home nation is:

{{quotation|
# A Player who, under the terms of art. 5, is eligible to represent more than one Association on account of his nationality, may play in an international match for one of these Associations only if, in addition to having the relevant nationality, he fulfils at least one of the following conditions:
#: a) He was born on the territory of the relevant Association;
#: b) His biological mother or biological father was born on the territory of the relevant Association;
#: c) One of his biological grandparents was born on the territory of the relevant Association;
#: d) He has engaged in a minimum of five years education under the age of 18 within the territory of the relevant association.|Home nations agreement}}

In July 2012, the Football Association of Wales confirmed that [[Swansea City F.C.]]'s Spanish defender [[Àngel Rangel]] is not eligible to represent Wales due to the agreement.<ref>{{cite news|title=Swansea City defender Angel Rangel ineligible for Wales|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18833190|work=BBC Sport|access-date=14 November 2012|date=13 July 2012}}</ref>

===2025 Football Association of Wales proposal===
In February 2025, the Football Association of Wales expressed an interest in selecting English-born midfielder [[Matt Grimes]] for international duty, and proposed changes to the home nation agreement to allow this. Under the FAW's proposals, a player would become eligible to represent a home nation if he is registered as a player for at least 5 years with a club within the relevant territory. Under these rules, Grimes would become eligible as he was registered as a [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] player for 10 years from 2015 to 2025. Under the current agreement, Grimes is ineligible to represent Wales as he was not born in the territory, has no parents or grandparents born in the territory, and did not have at least 5 years of education before the age of 18 in the territory. The proposal would need the support of [[The Football Association]], [[Scottish Football Association]] and [[Irish Football Association]] to pass.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c805ndxv013o |title=Wales target Grimes in bid to change eligibility rules |publisher=BBC News |date=10 February 2025 |access-date=11 February 2025}}</ref>

==Northern Ireland==
Players born in [[Northern Ireland]], who have at least one parent with "settled status" in the UK  are [[British citizens]] at birth but are also entitled to have Irish nationality   which entitles them to be selected for the representative teams of the [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA - Northern Ireland) as well as of the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI - Republic of Ireland).

In this connection, two points were raised from the national associations of Belgium and Northern Ireland: (…)

''b) Irish Football Association (Northern Ireland)''

The Committee considered this association's statement that almost any player can obtain a Republic of Ireland passport in order to secure eligibility to play for this country.

The Committee discussed this very serious matter at length and had to come to the unfortunate conclusion that FIFA cannot interfere with the decisions taken by any country in the question of granting passports.

The only way that the national associations could prevent their nationals from being systematically granted passports by another country to enable them to play for its national teams would be to field them in an official match for one of their national representative teams, which would bind them to this particular association"

In 2009, [[Daniel Kearns (footballer)|Daniel Kearns]], who had represented Northern Ireland at youth level, declared for the Republic of Ireland. He was born in Belfast and his parents and grandparents were all from Northern Ireland. The IFA complained to FIFA that Kearns should be ineligible to represent the Republic of Ireland. FIFA responded: "As the FIFA Legal Committee understands it, the situation in Northern Ireland is such that all Northern Irish footballers could opt to play for your association teams, given that they have a birthright to an Irish passport. Evidently, the same is not applicable to the footballers of the Republic of Ireland, who do not have such a claim to a UK passport. This means that the [IFA] is exposed to a one-way situation, where players can choose to play for your association teams but the vice versa is not possible. This circumstance is rather unique and the FIFA Statutes and regulations do not provide for a solution".<ref name="cas"/>

In 2007, the FIFA Legal Committee invited the FAI voluntarily to confine itself to selecting for its association teams Northern Irish players who meet one of the following requirements: a) the player was born in the Republic of Ireland, b) his biological mother or father was born in the Republic of Ireland, c) his grandmother or grandfather was born in the Republic of Ireland, or d) he has lived continuously, for at least two years, in the Republic of Ireland.

FIFA also proposed an agreement between the Irish FA and the Football Association of Ireland which read:<ref name="cas"/>
:(…) every player born on the territory of Northern Ireland, holding the UK nationality and being entitled to a passport of the Republic of Ireland or born on the territory of the Republic of Ireland and holding the Irish nationality could either play for the [FAI] or the [IFA], under the condition that all other relevant prerequisites pertaining to player's eligibility for a specific Association team are fulfilled

Whereas the FAI favoured the proposal, the IFA did not. Following the IFA's rejection, FIFA told the IFA that they had "concluded to adhere to the status quo".<ref name="cas"/>

In 2010, the IFA challenged the FAI in the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS).<ref name="cas"/> CAS concluded that the Irish FA "cannot reasonably claim that Mr Kearns' situation is to be equated with shared nationality as provided under Article 16 or that he requests a change of association from a starting point of a shared nationality. His situation, with respect to his Irish nationality, is not governed by Article 16, but by the general principle set forth by Article 15 par. 1 of the said Regulations. No further connection (as described by Article 16) has to exist between Mr Kearns and the Republic of Ireland to make him eligible to play for the FAI's representative team."<ref name="cas"/>
