The '''Cruyff turn''' is an evasive [[dribbling]] move used in [[association football|football]], and named after Dutch player [[Johan Cruyff]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2016/mar/24/what-is-a-cruyff-turn |title=What is a Cruyff Turn?|first1=Finbarr |last1=Sheehy|first2=Scott |last2=Murray|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 March 2016|accessdate=10 July 2018}}</ref> 

In the 22nd minute of the game against [[Swedish national football team|Sweden]] in the group stage of the [[1974 World Cup]], while Cruyff had control of the ball in an attacking position and being guarded tightly by Swedish defender [[Jan Olsson (footballer, born 1942)|Jan Olsson]], Cruyff feigned a pass before dragging the ball behind his standing leg, turning 180 degrees, and accelerating away.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/world-cup-soccer/4/blog/post/1845160/all-time-top-20-no-3-johan-cruyff|title=Johan Cruyff: All-time Top 20: No. 3|first=John|last=Brewin|date=24 March 2016|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=[[ESPN]]}}</ref> With its simplicity, effectiveness and unpredictability, the Cruyff turn remains one of the most commonly recognized [[dribbling]] moves in modern football.<ref name="Cruyff Turn">[http://www.espnfc.com/blog/_/name/worldcupcentral/id/3495?cc=5739 "All-time Top 20: No. 3 Johan Cruyff"], espnfc.com; retrieved 17 November 2013.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/11/world-cup-stunning-moments-johan-cruyff-turn-1974 |author=Murray, Scott |title=World Cup: 25 stunning moments … No25: the Cruyff Turn is born in 1974 |work=The Guardian |date=11 June 2014 |accessdate=11 August 2016 }}</ref><ref name="Kanu-Cruyffturn">{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/euro2016/euro-2016-wales-striker-hal-robsonkanu-on-that-cruyff-turn-and-the-years-he-spent-perfecting-a3289326.html |author=Majendie, Matt |title=Euro 2016: Wales striker Hal Robson-Kanu on that Cruyff turn and the years he spent perfecting technique |publisher=Standard.co.uk |date=6 July 2016 |accessdate=6 August 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/johan-cruyff-turn-anniversary-netherlands-skill-date-world-cup-sweden-defender |author=White, Mark |title=Simplicity matters: how did the Cruyff Turn become so iconic? |work=[[FourFourTwo]].com |date=19 June 2020 |accessdate=9 July 2020 }}</ref>

The fact that the feint was named after Cruyff, however, does not mean that Cruyff was the first to perform this move. Just like with most evasive dribbles, feints and tricks, the first footballer to perform it, is almost always impossible to trace down. Pele, for example, performed the trick in 1960 (vs Juventus).
