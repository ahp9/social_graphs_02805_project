{{Short description|Sports action in which a player moves between clubs}}

In professional [[association football|football]], a '''transfer''' is when a player under contract moves from one [[football club|club]] to another. It refers to the transferring of a player's registration to their new club. In general, players can only be transferred during a [[transfer window]] and according to the rules set by a [[sport governing body|governing body]]. A transfer fee is the agreed financial compensation paid by the new club to the selling club.<ref>{{Cite web|title=How does a football transfer work?|url=https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20170829-how-does-a-football-transfer-work|access-date=2021-08-28|website=www.bbc.com|date=29 August 2017 |language=en}}</ref> When a player moves from one club to another, their old [[contract]] is terminated whilst the player and their new club will both negotiate on new contract terms, or have earlier agreed on the personal terms. 

A transfer in association football differs from a [[Trade (sports)|trade]] in American, Canadian, and Australian sports, where teams essentially exchange players and their contracts, occasionally including cash as well. In some cases, football transfers operate in a similar way, as teams can exchange players as part of the deal.

According to FIFA, from January to September 2018 there were 15,049 international transfers of male players with fees totalling US$7.1 billion, and 577 international transfers of female players for US$493,235.<ref>[http://www.insideworldfootball.com/2018/09/19/fifa-report-shows-small-developing-global-womens-transfer-market/ FIFA report shows small but developing global women’s transfer market] - Inside World Football, 19 September 2018</ref>

Most transfer activity is conducted during the European summer [[transfer window]] (European pre-season window), between 1 July and 31 August each year (both dates inclusive), with slight variations of the start date and end dates for each domestic league.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=2021-08-29|title=When does the 2021/2022 football transfer window close in each league?|url=https://en.as.com/en/2021/08/29/soccer/1630224255_602750.html|access-date=2021-08-31|website=AS.com|language=en}}</ref> Some transfers also occur during the European winter transfer window of 1–31 January.<ref name=":2" /> The transfer deadline dates of the windows are solely reliant upon the country jurisdiction of the purchasing club, in order to register newly transferred players. Football clubs worldwide may sell the playing rights of a contracted player at any time to another club whose country's transfer window is still open. In addition, [[Free agent#Association football|free agents]] (players who are not under contract) may be signed at any time outside the transfer windows.<ref name=":2" />

===Early days of transfers===
The concept of a football transfer first came into existence in England after [[The Football Association]] (FA) introduced player registration sometime after 1885. Before that, a player could agree to play one or more matches for any football club. After the FA recognised [[Professionalism in association football|professionalism]] in 1885,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/global-growth.html |title=History of Football - The Global Growth |access-date=20 April 2014 |publisher=FIFA Official Website |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821083313/http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/global-growth.html |archive-date=21 August 2014 }}</ref> it sought to control professional players by introducing a player registration system. Players had to register with a club each season, even if he remained with the same club as in the season before. A player was not allowed to play until he was registered for that season. Once a player was registered with a club he was not allowed to be registered with or play for another club during the same season without the permission of the FA and the club that held his registration. However players were free to join another club before the start of each season, even if their former club wished to retain them.

Sometime after the [[The Football League|Football League]] was formed in 1888 the Football League decided to introduce the [[retain-and-transfer system]], which restricted clubs from luring players from other clubs, thereby preventing clubs from losing their players and preventing the league from being dominated by a handful of rich clubs. From the start of the 1893–94 season onwards, once a player was registered with a Football League club, he could not be registered with any other club, even in subsequent seasons, without the permission of the club he was registered with. It applied even if the player's annual contract with the club holding their registration was not renewed after it expired. The club was not obliged to play them and, without a contract, the player was not entitled to receive a salary. Nevertheless, if the club refused to release his registration, the player could not play for any other Football League club. Football League clubs soon began to demand and earn a transfer fee from any other Football League club as [[consideration]] for agreeing to release or transfer the player's registration.

In 1912 [[Charles Sutcliffe]] helped establish the legality of this retain-and-transfer system when he successfully represented his club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] during the [[Kingaby case]].<ref>Matthew Taylor, 'Sutcliffe, Charles Edward (1864–1939)', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004</ref> The former Villa player [[Herbert Kingaby]] had brought legal proceedings against the club for preventing him from playing. However an erroneous strategy pursued by Kingaby's counsel resulted in the suit being dismissed.<ref name="DMcA">David McArdle, [[LLB]] [[PhD]], ''[http://webjcli.ncl.ac.uk/2000/issue2/mcardle2.html#Heading7 The Football League's player registration scheme and the Kingaby case] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301021524/http://webjcli.ncl.ac.uk/2000/issue2/mcardle2.html |date=2010-03-01 }}'', accessed 16 December 2012</ref> In England, the "retain" aspect of the system was removed after a decision by the High Court in 1963 in ''Eastham v Newcastle United'' that it was unreasonable.

===1995: Bosman ruling===

[[File:Edgar Davids.jpg|thumb|In 1996, Dutchman [[Edgar Davids]] was the first high-profile player to move on a free transfer via the [[Bosman ruling]].]]
The transfer system remained unchanged until the [[Bosman ruling]].

According to FIFPro's European president [[Bobby Barnes]], 28% of the money from a transfer fee is paid to agents,<ref name="FIFProTelegraph" /> and that many players are not paid on time or at all.<ref name="FIFProTelegraph" /><ref name="FIFProGuardian" /> He claims this leads to these players being "vulnerable targets of crime syndicates, who instigate match-fixing and threaten the very existence of credible football competitions".<ref name="FIFProOfficial" /> Writing for the [[BBC]], Matt Slater said that "professional footballers do not enjoy the same freedoms that almost every other EU worker does",<ref name="FIFProBBC" /> and that "players look at US sport, and wonder why their career prospects are still constrained by transfer fees and compensation costs". Barnes argues that "the system encourages speculative, unsustainable, immoral and illegal investment models like third-party ownership of players".<ref name="FIFProGuardian" />

In 2017, FIFPro agreed to drop the legal challenge after they came to an understanding with FIFA, signing a six-year agreement to improve governance of transfers and conduct a review of the current system.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41885212 |title=Football transfers: Fifpro drop bid to end transfer system |date=6 November 2017 |access-date=28 December 2020 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref> Under the new terms, players who are unpaid by their parent club, mistreated or subject to abusive behaviour, are free to break their contract and leave.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.espn.co.uk/football/soccer-transfers/story/3261875/players-win-right-to-break-bad-contracts-under-new-fifpro-fifa-deal |title=Players win right to break bad contracts under new FIFPro/FIFA deal |date=6 November 2017 |access-date=28 December 2020 |publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Homewood |first=Brian |url=https://www.eurosport.co.uk/football/players-union-to-withdraw-challenge-to-transfer-system_sto6401560/story.shtml |title=Players' union to withdraw challenge to transfer system |date=6 November 2017 |access-date=28 December 2020 |publisher=[[Eurosport]]}}</ref>

===Failed medicals===
One of the earliest, and most high profile, example of a transfer being cancelled due to medical issues in the UK was in November 1971 when [[Asa Hartford]]'s transfer to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] from [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] collapsed. Amidst a high level of publicity, the two clubs had agreed a fee of £177,000, a then record for Leeds United; but a medical examination found Hartford had a pin-sized hole in his heart, a slight defect he had been born with but had never impacted the progression of his career. On the advice of their medical staff, Leeds United cancelled the transfer. Despite this, Hartford went on to have a long successful playing career, including appearing for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] and [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cups]], with his minor heart defect never causing an issue.<ref>{{cite web|title=Review of 1971/72 - Part 2: The Asa Hartford affair|url=http://www.mightyleeds.co.uk/seasons/197172part2.htm|website=The Mighty Mighty Whites|access-date=24 September 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909074319/http://www.mightyleeds.co.uk/seasons/197172part2.htm|archive-date=9 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Asa Hartford and the hole in the heart|url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/blogs/asa-hartford-356133|website=World Soccer|date=30 August 2014|access-date=31 August 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114060209/http://www.worldsoccer.com/blogs/asa-hartford-356133|archive-date=14 November 2015}}</ref>

It was not until [[1928 in association football|1928]] that the first five-figure transfer took place. [[David Jack (footballer)|David Jack]] of [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] was the subject of interest from Arsenal, and in order to negotiate the fee down, Arsenal manager [[Herbert Chapman]] got the Bolton representatives [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16066822 |title=Arsenal honour Thierry Henry, Tony Adams & Herbert Chapman |publisher=BBC |date=7 December 2011 |access-date=12 January 2014}}</ref><ref name="442Records">{{cite news |last=Flanagan |first=Chris |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/how-13-other-world-record-transfers-panned-out |title=How 13 other world record transfers panned out |publisher=Four Four Two |date=4 September 2013 |access-date=12 January 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110171831/http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/how-13-other-world-record-transfers-panned-out |archive-date=10 November 2013 }}</ref> Arsenal paid £10,890 after Bolton had asked for £13,000, which was double the previous record made when Sunderland signed [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]'s [[Bob Kelly (footballer)|Bob Kelly]] a fee of for £6,500.<ref name="BBCRecords" />

The first player from outside [[Great Britain]] to break the record was [[Bernabé Ferreyra]], a player known as "La Fiera" for his powerful shot. His [[1932 in association football|1932]] transfer from [[Club Atlético Tigre|Tigre]] to [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] cost £23,000,<ref name="442Records" /> and the record would last for 17 years (the longest the record has lasted) until it was broken by Manchester United's sale of [[Johnny Morris (footballer)|Johnny Morris]] to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] for £24,000 in March 1949. The record was broken seven further times between 1949 and 1961, when [[Luis Suárez (footballer, born 1935)|Luis Suárez]] was sold by Barcelona to Inter Milan for £152,000, becoming the first ever player sold for more than £100,000.<ref name="BBCRecords" />

In [[1968 in association football|1968]], [[Pietro Anastasi]] became the first £500,000 player when Juventus purchased him from [[A.S. Varese 1910|Varese]],<ref name="442Records" /> which was followed seven years later with [[Giuseppe Savoldi]] becoming the first million pound player when he transferred from [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] to [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]].<ref name="BBCRecords" /><ref name="442Records" />

In English football, the first £1&nbsp;million fee occurred in 1979, when [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] signed striker [[Trevor Francis]] from [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. Later in the same year, the English record fee was broken twice, with fees of close to £1.5&nbsp;million being paid by Manchester City to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] for [[Steve Daley]], and by Wolverhampton Wanderers to Aston Villa for [[Andy Gray (footballer, born 1955)|Andy Gray]]. This was during a time when transfer fees were rapidly growing in English football, and the £1.5&nbsp;million mark was finally reached in 1981 when Manchester United signed [[Bryan Robson]] from [[West Bromwich Albion]]. However, a change in transfer regulations around this time meant that all fees had to be paid in full within 12 months of the transfer being completed, and at least half of the fee had to be paid when the transfer was first finalised. Consequently, Robson's record fee remained intact for six years, when Liverpool signed [[Peter Beardsley]] from [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for £1.9&nbsp;million. However, fees well in excess of £2&nbsp;million had already been paid to English clubs by Barcelona, who had signed [[Mark Hughes]] from Manchester United and [[Gary Lineker]] from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 1986. At this time, the highest transfer fees were mostly paid by Italian and Spanish clubs. Juventus paid Liverpool more than £3&nbsp;million for [[Ian Rush]].

The first £2&nbsp;million fee paid by an English club came in the summer of 1988, when Tottenham Hotspur signed [[Paul Gascoigne]] from Newcastle United. Within weeks of Gascoigne's transfer, the national record was broken again when [[Tony Cottee]] moved from [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] to Everton for £2.2&nbsp;million, and again shortly afterwards when Ian Rush returned to Liverpool from Juventus for £2.8&nbsp;million.

In the space of two months in the summer of [[1992 in association football|1992]],<ref name="442Records" /> three transfers broke the record,<ref name="BBCRecords" /> all by Italian clubs: [[Jean-Pierre Papin]] transferred from [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] to Milan, becoming the world's first ever £10&nbsp;million player.<ref name="442Records" /> Almost immediately, rivals Juventus topped that with the signing of [[Gianluca Vialli]] for a fee of £12&nbsp;million from [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]]. Milan then completed the signing of [[Gianluigi Lentini]] for a fee of £13&nbsp;million, which stood as the record for three years. In contrast, the English record fee that year was set at £3.6&nbsp;million [[Alan Shearer]] moved to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], a decade after the world's first £3&nbsp;million transfer.

Lentini's transfer remained intact the world record fee for the next four years, although the national record was broken more than once in many countries including England. Shearer's £3.6million record fee was narrowly eclipsed 12 months later when Manchester United signed [[Roy Keane]] from Nottingham Forest for £3.75&nbsp;million. In 1994, Blackburn Rovers paid a record £5&nbsp;million for [[Chris Sutton]] from [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], a decade after the world's first £5&nbsp;million transfer. Then, in 1995, the national record fee was broken three times in six months – first when [[Andy Cole]] joined Manchester United from Newcastle United for £7&nbsp;million, then with Arsenal's £7.5&nbsp;million move for Dutch striker [[Dennis Bergkamp]] from Inter Milan, and finally with Liverpool's £8.5&nbsp;million move for Nottingham Forest's [[Stan Collymore]].

The [[1996 in association football|1996]] transfer of Shearer from Blackburn Rovers to Newcastle United, for a fee of £15&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Turnbull |first1=Simon |last2=Nixon |first2=Alan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/shearer-goes-home-for-pounds-15m-1331235.html |title=Shearer goes home for pounds 15m |date=30 July 1996 |access-date=12 January 2014 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105081252/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/shearer-goes-home-for-pounds-15m-1331235.html |archive-date=5 November 2012 }}</ref> kickstarted a year-by-year succession of global record breaking transfers, as well as being the first time in decades that an English club had broken the world record for a transfer fee. It also reflected the rapid rise in English transfer fees since the creation of the [[Premier League]] in 1992. Five years earlier, a year before the new league's creation, the national record fee had stood at £2.9&nbsp;million. Even Collymore's transfer 12 months before Shearer's was little more than half of the money paid for the latest record-breaking transfer.

Although Shearer's status as the world's most expensive footballer would only last for one year, he remained unmatched as the most expensive footballer in England for four years, when Chelsea signed the Dutch striker [[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink]] for £15&nbsp;million. Later that year, Shearer's record was finally eclipsed when [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] paid £18&nbsp;million for West Ham United's [[Rio Ferdinand]]. In the summer of 2001, the English record was broken twice in the space of a few weeks, both times by Manchester United, who first signed Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy for £19&nbsp;million, and then signed Argentine midfielder [[Juan Sebastián Verón]] for £28.1&nbsp;million. A year later, they broke the English record fee again by signing Rio Ferdinand from Leeds United for a fee in the region of £29&nbsp;million, 11 years after Liverpool had paid a mere tenth of that figure to set an English record transfer fee when they signed [[Dean Saunders]].

It took two weeks for the record to be broken when [[Luís Figo]] made a controversial £37&nbsp;million move from Barcelona to fierce rivals Real Madrid.<ref name="BBCRecords" /><ref name="Figo37m">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/848836.stm|title=Figo's the Real deal|publisher=BBC|date=24 July 2000|access-date=1 September 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802163822/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/848836.stm|archive-date=2 August 2017}}</ref> From that time through the 2015–16 season, Real Madrid held the record, with the next players to subsequently break the record being [[Zinedine Zidane]] in [[2001 in association football|2001]] when he signed for £46&nbsp;million from Juventus,<ref name="BBCRecords" /> [[Kaká]] from Milan for just under £60&nbsp;million in [[2009 in association football|2009]],<ref>The Times Madrid Signs Kaká [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article6458907]{{dead link|date=September 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

For example, the [[2004 in association football|2004]] transfer of [[Wayne Rooney]] from Everton to Manchester United cost an initial fee of £20&nbsp;million that rose to £27&nbsp;million due to the number of appearances he made and the number of trophies he won with the club.<ref name="RooneyTransfer">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/3611234.stm |title=Man Utd sign Rooney |date=31 August 2004 |access-date=28 June 2013 |publisher=BBC |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923084647/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/3611234.stm |archive-date=23 September 2013 }}</ref>

The following tables show the highest transfer fees ever paid in [[euro]] for players and [[Manager (association football)|managers]]. The first features the top 20 most expensive transfers involving players, and contains eight transfers which broke the [[World football transfer record|world transfer record]]: those of Neymar in 2017, Paul Pogba, Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo and Hernán Crespo all broke the record.

The second list shows the top 20 most expensive transfers involving managers. When a manager moves from one club to another, it usually involves a small figure of compensation being paid, and the figure is rarely released publicly. Because of this, there have only been 20 managers who have ever cost more than £1&nbsp;million in compensation, as detailed in the table.

===Players===
[[File:Mbappe Messi Neymar.jpg|thumb|right|[[Neymar]] (right) and [[Kylian Mbappé]] (left) are the two most expensive association football transfers.]]
Due to fluctuations in exchange rates lists of the most expensive transfers vary depending on the currency used. Most high-priced transfers take place between clubs in the [[Eurozone]] and/or the United Kingdom. Fees are often not officially announced, and figures reported by the media may not necessarily be accurate.

==Other types of transfers==
As well as this type of regular transfer, which results in the player being "owned" by one club, other forms of transfer are used throughout [[CONMEBOL|South America]] and southern Europe.

=== Pre-contract ===
A pre-contract is an agreement by a player and an agreeing to take his registration at a later date, and became more well known after the [[Bosman ruling]] in 1995.<ref name="LawInSport">{{cite news |url=http://www.lawinsport.com/blog/john-shea/item/the-enforceability-of-pre-contracts-in-football |title=The enforceability of pre-contracts in football |publisher=Law In Sport |date=25 July 2013 |access-date=11 January 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111053344/http://www.lawinsport.com/blog/john-shea/item/the-enforceability-of-pre-contracts-in-football |archive-date=11 January 2014 }}</ref> A club may sign a pre-contract with a player while he is still with another club, by which the player agrees to move to the club at a future date, usually after his contract with his current club expires. Under the Bosman ruling, a player can sign a contract with a new club up to six months before his existing contract expires.<ref name="EULaw">{{cite news |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61993CJ0415 |title=Union royale belge des sociétés de football association ASBL v Jean-Marc Bosman, Royal club liégeois SA v Jean-Marc Bosman and others and Union des associations européennes de football (UEFA) v Jean-Marc Bosman |publisher=European Union |date=15 December 1995 |access-date=23 July 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831232144/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61993CJ0415 |archive-date=31 August 2015 }}</ref>

A pre-contract agreement may be broken by the player or the club, depending on the completeness of the terms of that pre-contract and thus how close it was to being considered a valid contract under local law. In the 2014 case of ''Beijing Renhe FC v. Marcin Robak'', the player met with the Chinese club's owner, agreed on length and compensation, put those in writing, received a signed copy of both the transfer agreement from his current club and his employment contract, and then Beijing Renhe FC retracted the agreement while saying they couldn't finalize transfer terms with his departing club.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Macri |first1=Francesco |title=Pre-contracts in football employment relationships: a CAS case |url=https://theimpactlawyers.com/articles/pre-contracts-in-football-employment-relationships-a-cas-case |website=The Impact Lawyers |access-date=14 October 2023}}</ref> [[FIFA]]'s Dispute Resolution body ruled that due to the extensive provisions and signatures on the exchanged documents, a legally binding contract had been entered into, and awarded €330,000 to Robak in compensation. On appeal, [[Court of Arbitration for Sport|CAS]] upheld the award but further ruled that because of the tentative nature or omission of some common contract provisions, it was in fact a pre-contract, subject to lower damages (while still obliging all sides to resolve final contract terms in good faith, which the acquiring club had not done).

Although a pre-contract agreement is usually signed to secure the future registration of a player, an agreement can be reached where the club gaining the registration can pay a fee to the other club to sign the player earlier, as was the case in January 2013, when [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] midfielder [[Lewis Holtby]], who had six months remaining on his contract, signed a pre-contract agreement with Tottenham Hotspur,<ref>{{cite news |last=Riach |first=James |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/04/tottenham-arsenal-schalke-lewis-holtby |title=Tottenham steal a march on Arsenal to sign Schalke's Lewis Holtby |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 January 2013 |access-date=11 January 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112002224/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/04/tottenham-arsenal-schalke-lewis-holtby |archive-date=12 January 2014 }}</ref> but at the end of the month, Tottenham paid a fee of £1.5&nbsp;million to bring the transfer forward.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hytner |first=David |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jan/29/lewis-holtby-tottenham-hotspur |title=Lewis Holtby could prove to be Tottenham's deal of the century |date=29 January 2013 |access-date=11 January 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112001134/http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jan/29/lewis-holtby-tottenham-hotspur |archive-date=12 January 2014 }}</ref>

=== Co-ownership ===
[[Co-ownership (football)|Co-ownership]] is a system whereby a club will purchase 50% of the rights of a player's contract for one year and pay the wages, while also deciding which of the two clubs he will play for.<ref name="Coowner">{{cite news |last=Bandini |first=Nicky |url=http://blogs.thescore.com/counterattack/2013/07/15/bandini-the-weird-and-wonderful-world-of-player-co-ownership-in-italian-football/ |title=The weird and wonderful world of player co-ownership in Italian football |date=15 July 2013 |access-date=12 January 2014 |publisher=The Score |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140112012352/http://blogs.thescore.com/counterattack/2013/07/15/bandini-the-weird-and-wonderful-world-of-player-co-ownership-in-italian-football/ |archive-date=12 January 2014 }}</ref> At the end of the year, both clubs can choose to place a bid in an auction, where the highest bid wins.<ref name="Coowner" /> The co-ownership of [[Alessio Cerci]] by [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] and [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] proved fruitful for Cerci and Torino,<ref>{{cite news |last=Bandini |first=Nicky |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/nov/04/serie-a-alessio-cerci-torino-italy |title=Torino and Italy given reason to smile by second coming of Alessio Cerci |date=4 November 2013 |access-date=12 January 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116032037/http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/nov/04/serie-a-alessio-cerci-torino-italy |archive-date=16 November 2013 }}</ref> who had paid €2.5&nbsp;million for the first 50%,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11866/8030793/cerci-completes-torino-switch |title=Cerci completes Torino switch |date=29 August 2012 |access-date=12 January 2014 |publisher=Sky Sports |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112015039/http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11866/8030793/cerci-completes-torino-switch |archive-date=12 January 2014 }}</ref> and picked up the remainder of his contract after a successful year for just €3.8&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/news/12040/8785784/ |title=Torino buy remaining half of Alessio Cerci's registration from Fiorentina |date=20 June 2013 |access-date=12 January 2014 |publisher=Sky Sports |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112015300/http://www1.skysports.com/news/12040/8785784/ |archive-date=12 January 2014 }}</ref>

In May 2014, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) announced it would be ending co-ownership of players to bring Serie A in line with every other league around Europe. The existing ownership deals could be for a year and at the end of it the player and the club must reach an agreement.<ref name=":0"/><ref name=":1"/>

=== Third-party ownership ===
[[Third-party ownership in association football|Third party ownership]] is ownership of a player's economic rights by third-party sources, such as football agents, sports-management agencies, or other investors. The involvement of investors in the "ownership" of players is a common practice in football, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, where many clubs are insolvent or financially limited. Businessmen or other investors buy shares in the economic rights of young players and often cover the costs of their training and accommodation. In return they are entitled to a percentage of a player's future transfer fee.<ref name="Hammers face a pounding over third-party player agreements2">{{cite news |last=Conn |first=David |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/21/newsstory.sport |title=Hammers face a pounding over third-party player agreements |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 March 2007 |access-date=28 July 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228153223/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/21/newsstory.sport |archive-date=28 February 2014 }}</ref>

==Loan and other transfer-related clauses==

=== Loan ===
{{further|topic=loan|loan (sports)}}
An alternative or an intermediary of a transfer, is a [[Loan (sports)|loan]]. This is where a player is allowed to temporarily play for a club other than the one he is currently contracted to. Loan deals may last from a few weeks to all season-long and can also last for a few seasons. Rarely, a loan of a player can be included in the transfer of another player; for example, the transfer of [[Dimitar Berbatov]] from Tottenham Hotspur to Manchester United for £31&nbsp;million in 2008 included the loan of [[Fraizer Campbell]] in the opposite direction.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/7589224.stm |title=Spurs bring in Campbell on loan |date=1 September 2008 |access-date=30 September 2013 |publisher=BBC |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919065241/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/7589224.stm |archive-date=19 September 2008 }}</ref>

Loans often require loanee clubs to pay the loaning club a loan fee for the privilege of obtaining the services of a player on loan. The loanee club, also usually has to pay for the  entire salary owed to the player, during the duration of the loan. However, in both instances of high-profile loans of [[Alexis Sánchez|Alexis Sanchez]] (from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] to [[Inter Milan]] in 2019<ref>{{Cite web|last=|date=2019-08-30|title=Sanchez joins Inter on loan, but will still be one of Man United's top earners|url=https://talksport.com/football/593903/alexis-sanchez-inter-milan-manchester-united/|access-date=2021-08-29|website=talkSPORT|language=en-US}}</ref>) and [[Gareth Bale]] (from [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] in 2020<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-18|title=How Bale's wages will compare to his new Spurs teammates - even with Real Madrid paying half|url=https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/gareth-bale-wages-tottenham-real-madrid-salary-comparison-harry-kane-652772|access-date=2021-08-29|website=inews.co.uk|language=en}}</ref>), the loaning clubs would continue to pay a sizeable percentage of the high salaries owed during the loan, in order to successfully complete the loan out of an underperforming player with high salaries, in search for more playing time.

Loans can also be used to facilitate a permanent transfer that will only occur in the following year’s summer transfer window, often termed ''Loan with Obligation to Buy''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://footballhandbook.com/loan-with-obligation-to-buy-football/ | title=Loan With Obligation To Buy In Football (Explained) | date=2 June 2022 | accessdate=26 January 2024 }}</ref> This is often conducted in order to spread out the balance of payments of the purchasing club over an extra year, in order to comply with [[UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations|UEFA Financial Fair Play]] regulations.

Loans can also be used in conjunction with a permanent transfer of the same player within the same transfer window; the purchasing club (who bought the contractual playing rights of a footballer) can subsequently loan the player back to the selling club or a third club. This is to ensure both the transfer of playing rights ownership (to the purchasing club) and the pursuit of obtaining more experience and matchplay elsewhere (away from the congested squad depth of the purchasing club).

===Buy-back clause===

A transfer may also include a buy-back clause, whereby the selling club attaches an exercisable option to buy-back the player at a predetermined financial amount (which is usually higher than the initial purchase price of the buying club), at a predetermined later date (usually two years after the completed sale).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Football transfers: Buy-Back Clauses explained - LawInSport|url=https://www.lawinsport.com/topics/contract-law/item/football-transfers-buy-back-clauses-explained?category_id=117|access-date=2021-08-30|website=www.lawinsport.com}}</ref> If the option is not exercised by a certain date, the option expires. This is usually conducted by elite clubs who had earlier bought talented young players but would prefer the young players to improve their abilities and become more experienced. For the purchasing club, this would also guarantee the player’s services for a predetermined period (of at least 2 years).

This differs from a standing loan, as player ownership changes to the purchasing club along with a transfer fee being sent to the selling club, which enhances the selling club’s ability to adapt to the UEFA Financial Fair Play regulations.

Often, the buy-back clause is included with another [[right of first refusal]] clause, whereby if any third club offers to purchase a player from his current club (second club); the former club of the player (first club) which had previously included the buy-back clause, is able to match any financial offer (made by any third club) to purchase the player.

===Buyout clause===
{{further|topic=buyout clause|Buyout clause}}A buyout clause refers to a clause in a football player’s [[contract]] that requires a willing club which intends  to purchase the playing rights of the football player under contract with his current club, to pay a stipulated amount (which is usually substantially high) as stated within  the clause, to the club that still owns the contractual playing rights of the player. The buyout clause is only valid during the stipulated duration of the clause, and the current club may always choose to sell at a lower price and before the expiry of the clause, if it chooses to do so and agrees an early transfer with another club.

==Solidarity contribution==
[[File:Robinho061115-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Manchester City paid Santos €1.805&nbsp;million in solidarity contribution for Robinho.]]
Under FIFA rules,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/01/06/30/78/statusinhalt_en_122007.pdf |title=Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players |publisher=FIFA Official Website |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222194217/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/01/06/30/78/statusinhalt_en_122007.pdf |archive-date=2010-12-22 }}</ref> if a professional football player transfers to another club during the course of a contract, 5% of any transfer fee, not including training compensation paid to his former club, shall be deducted from the total amount of this transfer fee and distributed by the new club as a solidarity contribution to the club(s) involved in his training and education over the years.

As of July 2015, there is an ongoing controversy between several youth soccer clubs and the [[United States Soccer Federation]] (U.S. Soccer) over this issue. When [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[Seattle Sounders FC]] sold the rights to [[DeAndre Yedlin]] to Tottenham Hotspur for US$4&nbsp;million, a [[Seattle metropolitan area|Seattle-area]] youth club for which Yedlin had played, Crossfire Premier, sought its share of solidarity payments. While Spurs acknowledged Crossfire's claim, MLS and U.S. Soccer intercepted the funds before they could be sent to Crossfire, claiming that the sealed ruling in [[Fraser v. Major League Soccer|a 1996 antitrust case]] gave MLS exclusive rights to all transfer fees involving league players. Crossfire has since petitioned FIFA to either force payment or allow the club to sue MLS and U.S. Soccer; several other youth clubs have since joined in Crossfire's request, including one of [[Clint Dempsey]]'s previous clubs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-fc-yahoo/youth-club-s-petition-to-fifa-could-bring-cataclysmic-change-to-u-s--soccer-193554944.html |title=Youth club's petition to FIFA could bring cataclysmic change to U.S. soccer |first=Leander |last=Schaerlaeckens |work=[[Yahoo!

==Training compensation==
Training Compensation is compensation to the cost of training the players. In FIFA status:

{{blockquote|Training compensation shall be paid to a player’s training club(s): (1) when a player signs his first contract as a professional and (2) each time a professional is transferred until the end of the season of his 23rd birthday."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/regulations_on_the_status_and_transfer_of_players_en_33410.pdf|title=FIFA transfer regulations|work=FIFA.com|access-date=6 July 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913151636/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/regulations_on_the_status_and_transfer_of_players_en_33410.pdf|archive-date=13 September 2008}}</ref>}}

However, FIFA does not have any power to force member associations to enforce the clause, thus FIFA only has jurisdiction on international transfers for claiming compensation. Youth clubs are ranked by their sizes to receive certain amount of money, which the schedule of rate would be updated periodically, however the rates would also be affected by the new club that signs the player.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/02/07/46/83/circularno.1354-regulationsonthestatusandtransferofplayers-categorisationofclubsandregistrationperiods.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305080351/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/02/07/46/83/circularno.1354-regulationsonthestatusandtransferofplayers-categorisationofclubsandregistrationperiods.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-05 }}</ref> Newcastle United had to pay compensation for [[Charles N'Zogbia]] even though was signed as a free agent.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/01a4-0ea76c0a6f1d-5a094bd8a037-1000--n-zogbia-staying-at-newcastle/ |title=N'Zogbia staying at Newcastle |date=17 December 2004 |access-date=21 April 2014 |publisher=UEFA Official Website |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421051154/http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=270042.html |archive-date=21 April 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Haound |first=Patrick |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/2353576/nzogbia-to-stay-with-magpies |title=N'Zogbia to stay with Magpies |access-date=21 April 2014 |publisher=Sky Sports |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421081728/http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/2353576/nzogbia-to-stay-with-magpies |archive-date=21 April 2014 }}</ref>

Disagreement over training compensation sometimes produces legal battles in order to escape the payment, which [[Matthias Lepiller]] was signed in 2006 by Fiorentina, however an appeal in the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) was rejected in 2011, five years after Lepiller left the club. Clubs also arranged special transfer agreement in order to lower the actual signing cost. For example, [[Attila Filkor]] joined a Maltese club as free agent and immediately sold to Inter Milan. As the schedule of rates between Maltese and Italian top division were different, cost was saved until Filkor's mother club sued Inter to FIFA.

The FA has its own system of training compensation; for example, Chelsea were required to pay compensation to Manchester City for [[Daniel Sturridge]].

In December 2014, English teams Blackburn Rovers, Leeds United and Nottingham Forest were given a transfer ban of one transfer window for breaking league-implemented financial fair play regulations; the three clubs exceeded deviation limitations on operating loss and shareholder investment, set at £8&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/30478833 |title=Blackburn, Leeds and Nottingham Forest handed transfer embargoes |date=15 December 2014 |access-date=15 December 2014 |publisher=BBC |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215135214/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30478833 |archive-date=15 December 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11688/9607552/blackburn-leeds-and-nottingham-forest-hit-with-transfer-embargo |title=Blackburn, Leeds and Nottingham Forest hit with transfer embargo |date=15 December 2014 |access-date=15 December 2014 |publisher=Sky Sports |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215221659/http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11688/9607552/blackburn-leeds-and-nottingham-forest-hit-with-transfer-embargo |archive-date=15 December 2014 }}</ref>

In February 2019, [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] were banned by FIFA from signing new players for two transfer windows. The ban was handed following breach of international transfer and registration of players under the age of 18. However, the club still reserved the right to appeal to Court of Arbitration for Sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lastwordonfootball.com/2019/02/22/chelsea-handed-transfer-ban-for-breaching-fifa-rules/|title=Chelsea Handed Transfer Ban After Breaching FIFA Rules|access-date=22 February 2019|website=last word on football|date=22 February 2019}}</ref> In December 2019, the ban was reduced by CAS ahead of January transfer window.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playingfor90.com/2019/12/07/chelsea-boosted-reduced-transfer-ban/|title=Chelsea boosted by reduced transfer ban|access-date=7 December 2019|website=Playing for 90|date=7 December 2019}}</ref> However, the club in its statement said that FIFA's conduct was  “deeply unsatisfactory".“The approach taken by FIFA to this case has been deeply unsatisfactory, not least as FIFA chose to treat Chelsea entirely differently to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for reasons that make absolutely no sense to Chelsea,” a club's statement read.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.halsteadgazette.co.uk/uk_national_sport/18085997.chelsea-criticise-fifa-handling-transfer-ban-case/|title=Chelsea criticise FIFA handling of transfer ban case|access-date=6 December 2019|website=Halstead Gazette}}</ref><br><br>
The European Union's top court has declared some of FIFA's player transfer rules, particularly those requiring compensation when players end contracts early, as incompatible with EU free movement laws. The case, centered on former player Lassana Diarra, could prompt FIFA to revise its transfer policies, potentially giving players greater flexibility to switch clubs.<ref>{{Cite news |date=31 August 2024 |title=EU top court says some FIFA player transfer rules breach EU law |newspaper=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/eu-top-court-says-fifa-player-transfer-rules-breach-eu-law-2024-10-04/|access-date=5 October 2024}}</ref>
