In [[association football]], a '''transfer window''' is the period during the year in which a [[football club|club]] can add players to their squad who were previously under contract with another club. Such a [[Transfer (association football)|transfer]] is completed by registering the player into the new club through [[FIFA]]. "Transfer window" is the unofficial term commonly used by the media for the concept of "registration period" as described in the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/regulations%5fon%5fthe%5fstatus%5fand%5ftransfer%5fof%5fplayers%5fen%5f33410.pdf |title=Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (2008) |publisher=FIFA |access-date=23 January 2008 |date=19 October 2003 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913151636/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/regulations_on_the_status_and_transfer_of_players_en_33410.pdf |archive-date=13 September 2008 }}</ref> According to the rules, each national football association decides on the time (such as the dates) of the 'window' but it may not exceed 12 weeks. The second registration period occurs during the season and may not exceed four weeks.

The transfer window of a given football association governs only international transfers into that football association. International transfers out of an association are always possible to those associations that have an open window. The transfer window of the association that the player is leaving does not have to be open.

The window was introduced in response to negotiations with the [[European Commission]]. The system had been used in many [[UEFA|European leagues]] before being brought into compulsory effect by [[FIFA]] during the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03 season]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1780263.stm|title=Uefa wants transfer windows|work=BBC Sport|access-date=29 October 2008|date=24 January 2002}}</ref> English football was initially behind the plans when they were proposed in the early 1990s, in the hope that it would improve teams' stability and prevent agents from searching for deals all year around, but by the time it was eventually introduced they had to be persuaded that it would work.<ref>{{cite news |first1=John |last1=Ashdown |first2=Rob |last2=Smyth |title=Why does the Premier League have a January transfer window |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/feb/01/the-knowledge-premier-league-transfer-window |work=The Guardian |date=1 February 2012 |access-date=12 April 2012}}</ref> However, the exact regulations and possible exceptions are established by each competition's governing body rather than by the national football association.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/NewsFromTheFA/Postings/2005/01|archive-url=https://archive.today/20071029052205/http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/NewsFromTheFA/Postings/2005/01|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 October 2007|title=Transfer clarification|publisher=Football Association|access-date=29 October 2008|date=1 April 2005}}</ref>

{{Update|section|date=September 2023}}
FIFA regulates in general that there shall be two windows, a longer one (max. twelve weeks) in the break between seasons and a shorter one (max. one month) in the middle of a season. The specific periods depend on the league's season cycle and are determined by the national football authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/regulations_on_the_status_and_transfer_of_players_en_33410.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913151636/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/regulations_on_the_status_and_transfer_of_players_en_33410.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 September 2008|title=Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players|publisher=FIFA|access-date=29 October 2008|page=10}}</ref>

Most major European leagues commence in the second half of the year (e.g. August or September) and stretch over two calendar years to the first half of the next year (e.g. May), resulting in a close season window in the summer ending in August, and a mid-season window in January.

The periods are different when a league runs throughout a single calendar year, as in most [[Nordic countries]] due to weather constraints, [[Major League Soccer]] due to both weather and competition from other locally popular sports (notably [[basketball]] and [[American football]]), or as the traditional season in the Southern Hemisphere. The first window generally opens from 1 March until midnight of 30 April, followed by the in-season window from 1 to 31 August.

Although, in England, transfers between clubs in the same league can take place as soon as the last competitive fixtures for the season have been played, many transfers will not be completed until 1 July because many players' contracts expire on 30 June. International transfers into the English leagues (including the Premier League) cannot be made until the window has opened on 17 May. Outside the transfer window, a club may still sign players on an emergency basis, usually if they have no goalkeeper available. Special dispensation from their competition's governing body, for example the Premier League, is required. The transfer window restriction does not apply to clubs in or below the [[National League (division)|National League division]].<ref name="auto">{{cite web|last=Duncker|first=Charlotte|date=1 February 2018|title=When does the 2018 summer transfer window open?|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/summer-transfer-window-2018-open-14233730|access-date=20 March 2018|website=manchestereveningnews.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/mobile/football/13600908.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Transfers – June 2011 | date=31 May 2011 | access-date=11 June 2011 | archive-date=15 June 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615114036/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/mobile/football/13600908.stm | url-status=dead }}</ref>

The day upon which a window closes is known as [[transfer deadline day]], and is usually one of the busiest days of the window, generating a flurry of transfers, often because a number of interdependent transfers are completed resembling a [[Chain (real estate)|housing chain]], generating much media interest.

== Calls to end or reform the transfer window ==

[[Steve Coppell]], former manager of [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in England's [[Premier League]], and others have called for the transfer window to be scrapped in favour of the previous system, under which transfers could take place throughout the season other than in the closing weeks.<ref>{{cite news | date=2 January 2008| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/reading/article3120658.ece | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204205636/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/reading/article3120658.ece | url-status=dead | archive-date=4 December 2008 | title=Steve Coppell calls for end to transfer window | work=The Times | access-date=2 January 2008 | location=London | first=Fiona | last=Hamilton}}</ref> Coppell said that the transfer window breeds panic and encourages "scurrilous" transfer activity adding that "I cannot see the logic in a transfer window. It brings on a fire-sale mentality, causes unrest via the media and means clubs buy too many players" adding that "The old system, where if you had a problem you could look at loans or make a short-term purchase, was far better than this system we have at the moment".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2287651/Managers-hit-out-at-rubbish-transfer-system.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2287651/Managers-hit-out-at-rubbish-transfer-system.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Managers hit out at 'rubbish' transfer system |publisher=The Telegraph |date=1 January 2008 |access-date=31 January 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Former England Manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] has also questioned the value of the transfer window, commenting: "You do wonder at times if it is right to have a window, it was easier when it was open all the time and perhaps fairer for the players. I am sure much of the business being done on the last day is a little bit desperate and that is not right. I think it was better before, but then I am old".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_7152349,00.html? |title=Sven wants windows scrapped |publisher=Sky Sports |date=5 September 2011 |access-date=5 September 2011}}</ref>

In January 2013 [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] manager [[Arsène Wenger]] asked for the January transfer window to be limited to two transfers per window and claimed it is "unfair" in its current form. He cited [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] transfer activity as an example.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21193630 |title=Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger wants two-player transfer limit |work=BBC |date=25 January 2013 |access-date=25 January 2013}}</ref> The following year, Wenger hit out at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s £37 million purchase of [[Juan Mata]] from rivals [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Wenger argued that the transfer was unfair because United and Chelsea had already played each other twice during the season, but United would still have to play Arsenal, and said that "the rules should be adapted more for fairness".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11661/9129436/arsene-wenger-thinks-juan-matas-proposed-transfer-to-man-utd-from-chelsea-is-unfair |title=Arsene Wenger thinks Juan Mata's proposed transfer to Man Utd from Chelsea is unfair |publisher=Sky Sports |date=24 January 2014 |access-date=31 January 2014}}</ref> [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager [[Manuel Pellegrini]] backed the sentiment of Wenger, disagreeing that a player "can go from one team to another team in the same league at this part of the year" and also said that the winter transfer window was unbalanced in favour of big clubs, saying "a club with money can take the best players from the other teams".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/manuel-pellegrini-agrees-with-arsene-wenger--juan-mata-moving-from-chelsea-to-manchester-united-is-unfair-9083543.html |title=Manuel Pellegrini agrees with Arsene Wenger - Juan Mata moving from Chelsea to Manchester United is unfair |work=The Independent |date=24 January 2014 |access-date=31 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/10596136/Manchester-City-manager-Manuel-Pellegrini-backs-Arsenal-conterpart-Arsene-Wenger-over-Juan-Mata-transfer.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/10596136/Manchester-City-manager-Manuel-Pellegrini-backs-Arsenal-conterpart-Arsene-Wenger-over-Juan-Mata-transfer.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini backs Arsenal {{sic|nolink=y|conterpart}} Arsène Wenger over Juan Mata transfer |publisher=The Telegraph |date=24 January 2014 |access-date=31 January 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Former [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] manager [[Alan Pardew]] questioned why the Premier League transfer window remains open after the start of the season after Arsenal made a bid for midfielder [[Yohan Cabaye]] during his time as Newcastle United manager in August 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/23765521 |title=Alan Pardew unhappy at timing of Arsenal bid |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 August 2013 |access-date=31 January 2014}}</ref>

In January 2015, [[FIFPro]] said that the current transfer window system is "failing football and its players", one of the main issues being that players are released from clubs without explanation or compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31001193|title= Fifpro: players' union says 'failing' transfer system needs reform|date=27 January 2015|access-date=27 January 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>
