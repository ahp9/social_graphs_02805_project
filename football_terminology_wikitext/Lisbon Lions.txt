[[File:Celtic FC - Lisbon Lions Stand.JPG|thumb|The east stand at [[Celtic Park]] is named in honour of the team.]]
'''The Lisbon Lions''' is the [[nickname]] given to the [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] team that won the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] at the [[Estádio Nacional]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] on 25 May [[1967 European Cup Final|1967]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hunt|first1=Chris|title=In their own words: How Celtic's Lisbon Lions shocked 'unbeatable' Inter in 1967|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/their-own-words-how-celtics-lisbon-lions-shocked-unbeatable-inter-1967|access-date=11 May 2017|work=Four Four Two|date=19 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719105136/http://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/their-own-words-how-celtics-lisbon-lions-shocked-unbeatable-inter-1967|archive-date=19 July 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> defeating [[Inter Milan]] 2–1.

==Name==
The name is likely due to the fact that the Lisbon-based club [[Sporting CP|Sporting]]'s mascot is a lion and both clubs wear green and white horizontal stripes.<ref>[https://scottishfootballmuseum.org.uk/the-day-lisbon-belonged-to-celtic/ The Day Lisbon Belonged to Celtic], Stuart Spencer, [[Scottish Football Museum]], 25 May 2017</ref>

==Event==
[[File:Celtic - trophys.JPG|thumb|upright=1.13|A display of some of Celtic's trophies, including a replica of the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]] featuring prominently]]
All but two members of the 15 man squad were born within 10 miles of Celtic Park in Glasgow, Scotland ([[Bobby Lennox]], who was born 30 miles away in [[Saltcoats]], and [[Tommy Gemmell]], who was born in Motherwell 11 miles away).<ref name="game" /> Celtic's style was the antithesis of the cynical – but highly effective – [[catenaccio|defensive style]] of Inter. [[Jimmy Johnstone]] described the team's style as "like [[Total Football|the Dutch]] speeded-up".<ref>[http://www.manchestercsc.com/Lisbon%20Content.htm Memories of the day 'Wee Jinky' got his teeth into the European Cup, by Robert Philip] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615155045/http://www.manchestercsc.com/Lisbon%20Content.htm |date=15 June 2008}}</ref>

In the stadium where his father [[Valentino Mazzola|Valentino]] played his last match,<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Fox Sports]]|title=The last game of Grande Torino at Lisbon, May 4th 1949|url=http://foxsportsstories.com/2018/08/12/last-game-grande-torino-lisbon-may-4th-1949/|date=12 August 2018|access-date=10 May 2022}}</ref> [[Sandro Mazzola]] opened the scoring for Inter with a 7th-minute penalty after [[Jim Craig (Scottish footballer)|Jim Craig]] had brought down [[Renato Cappellini]]. The Italians then retreated into their famous 11-man defence. Inter did not win a single corner and forced Celtic goalkeeper [[Ronnie Simpson]] to make only two saves. Celtic had two shots off the crossbar, and 39 other attempts on goal, 13 of which were saved by Italian goalkeeper [[Giuliano Sarti]], seven were blocked or deflected, and 19 were off-target. Craig made amends for his penalty mistake on 63 minutes, when he laid off the ball for [[Tommy Gemmell]] to fire home for the Celtic equaliser. With 83 minutes on the clock, Gemmell was allowed space, and he played the ball to [[Bobby Murdoch]], whose long-range shot was deflected by [[Stevie Chalmers]] past Sarti into the net.

Celtic were the first British club to win the European Cup, and still the only Scottish club to have reached the final. Having already triumphed in the [[1966-67 Scottish Division One|Scottish top flight]], [[1966-67 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup]], and [[1966-67 Scottish League Cup|Scottish League Cup]], the Lisbon Lions became the first winners of the European [[Treble (association football)|Treble]] and remain the only winners of the fabled Quadruple.<ref>{{Cite web |date=10 June 2023 |title=Who has won a treble, including domestic league and cup titles, plus the European Cup or UEFA Champions League? |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0251-0e99b1ba85da-ec8053dc0a29-1000--who-has-won-a-treble-including-domestic-league-and-cup-title/ |access-date=14 June 2023 |website=UEFA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Jensen |first=Neil Fredrik |date=1 June 2022 |title=Celtic 1967 – the only quadruple winners |url=https://gameofthepeople.com/2022/06/01/celtic-1967-the-only-quadruple-winners/ |access-date=14 June 2023 |website=Game of the People}}</ref> Celtic are also one of just three European clubs to have won [[List of association football teams to have won four or more trophies in one season|five trophies in a single season]], thanks to their [[Glasgow Cup]] triumph over [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]]. They reached the European Cup final again in [[European Cup 1969–70|1970]] but were beaten 2–1 by [[Feyenoord Rotterdam|Feyenoord]] after [[extra time]] in the [[Stadio Giuseppe Meazza|San Siro]] Stadium in [[Milan]].
