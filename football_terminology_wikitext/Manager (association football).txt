In [[association football]], the '''manager''' is the person who has overall responsibility for the running of a [[football team]]. They have wide-ranging responsibilities, including selecting the team, choosing the tactics, recruiting and [[transfer (association football)|transferring]] players, negotiating player contracts, and speaking to the media.  In professional football, a manager is usually appointed by and answerable to the club's board of directors, but at an amateur level the manager may have total responsibility for the running of a club.
