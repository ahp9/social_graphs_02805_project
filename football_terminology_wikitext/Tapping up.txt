{{Short description|Persuading a player to transfer without permission from the player's current team}}
{{globalize|date=June 2023}}
In [[professional sport|professional]] [[team sport]]s, '''tapping up''' ([[British English]]) or '''tampering''' ([[American English]]) is an attempt to persuade a player contracted to one team to transfer to another team, without the knowledge or permission of the player's current team. This kind of approach is often made through the player's [[sports agent|agent]].

Often, to forestall the appearance of any palpable evidence of unethical behavior such transactions are informally negotiated while the player is still under contract, only being announced once the player's contract expires and/or the period where such transfers are officially permitted has commenced. While not criminal conduct, tampering expressly forbidden by many professional [[league (sports)|league]]s in their [[collective bargaining agreement]]s, bylaws and/or other rules and regulations. Incidents of tampering, when detected, can result in fines and/or sporting-related penalties being enforced against the offending teams, players, agents and/or other facilitating parties.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is 'tapping up' in football transfers & what are the most infamous examples? {{!}} Goal.com |url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-tapping-up-in-football-transfers-what-are-the-most/1jty660r0g5w01exvkszgir94u |website=www.goal.com |access-date=1 February 2022}}</ref>

A milder form of "tapping up" involves a [[manager (football)|manager]]'s letting his admiration for a player at another club become known, perhaps by hinting at his interest while working as a [[pundit (expert)|pundit]] during the broadcast of a game in which the player is taking part or by lavishing praise in programme notes when the two teams meet.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Andrade |first1=Jack |title=What is Tampering and Why Does the NFL Care About It? |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2015/03/25/what-is-tampering-and-why-does-the-nfl-care-about-it/ |website=www.boston.com |date=25 March 2015 |access-date=1 February 2022}}</ref> Most ex-players candidly admit that tapping up has gone on in football for decades. [[Nottingham Forest]] manager [[Brian Clough]] later said, "we tapped more players than the [[Severn Trent|Severn-Trent water board]]!"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2365552/Cloughs-cockiness-and-principles-live-on.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Clough's cockiness and principles live on | first=David | last=Miller | date=2005-09-20 | accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref>

Notorious examples of tapping up in the [[Premier League]] include [[Dwight Yorke]], [[Jermain Defoe]] and [[Ashley Cole]]. In these cases, the incidents soured the relationship between the player and his original club. Cole was found guilty and fined £100,000 by the Premier League on 2 June 2005 for a meeting in a hotel in January 2005 between himself, the Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]], Chelsea chief executive, [[Peter Kenyon]], and his agent [[Jonathan Barnett (sports agent)|Jonathan Barnett]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/5382332.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cole's agent handed FA suspension | date=2006-09-26 | access-date=2010-05-24}}</ref>

Chelsea were again at the centre of a controversy in 2009, when the club was found guilty of inducing [[Gaël Kakuta]] to break his contract with French team [[RC Lens]] in 2007. As punishment, they were banned by [[FIFA]] from registering new players for two [[transfer window]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/8236187.stm|title=Angry Chelsea hit by signings ban |work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=2009-09-03|access-date=2009-09-03}}</ref> Chelsea appealed to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]], who subsequently lifted the sanctions on the club and the player after ruling that Kakuta did not have a valid contract with Lens, and therefore could not have breached it. Chelsea's transfer ban was suspended later in the same year, and was lifted in February 2010.<ref name=Chels2>{{cite news|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/1955578|title=Statement on Kakuta Decision|publisher=Chelsea FC|date=4 February 2010|accessdate=25 May 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103092129/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/1955578|archivedate=3 January 2014}}</ref> [[Harry Redknapp]], manager of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] at that time, has said that activity which verges upon 'tapping-up' regularly occurs in deals between Premier League clubs,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2009/08/18/spurs-boss-redknapp-dismisses-tapping-up-rules-351827/|title=Redknapp dismisses 'tapping up' rules|publisher=Metro|work=[[The Press Association]]|date=2009-08-18|accessdate=2014-05-25}}</ref> and [[Scott Minto]], a pundit for [[Sky Sports]], said that the ban was "extremely harsh" because of the frequency of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11668_5536089,00.html|title=Can't turn the tap off|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=2009-09-03|accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref> However, there have been other cases where clubs have received transfer window bans for tapping-up; notably, [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] over [[Philippe Mexès]], and [[FC Sion]] over [[Essam El-Hadary]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/03/chelsea-transfer-ban|title=Chelsea's transfer ban: four other examples from football|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2009-09-03|accessdate=2009-09-03 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Binks}}</ref>

The practice of tapping up is portrayed in the 1953 British film ''[[The Great Game (1953 film)|The Great Game]]''.
