An '''empty net goal''', abbreviated as '''EN''' or '''ENG''' and colloquially called an '''empty netter''', occurs in several team sports when a team scores a goal into a net with no [[goaltender]] ''(goalie)'' present.

==Ice hockey==
Empty net goals usually occur on two occasions in ice hockey: 
#In the final minutes of a game, if a team is within two [[goal (ice hockey)|goal]]s, they will often ''pull the goalie'', leaving the net defenseless, for an [[extra attacker]], in order to have a better chance of scoring to either tie or get within one goal. However, if the team holding the lead gains control of the [[hockey puck|puck]], they will often shoot at the empty net after clearing center ice. It is less common for a team to shoot from their own zone at an empty net because [[icing (ice hockey)|icing]] could occur if the shooter misses the net. A notable instance of this happening occurred on January 21, 2022, when [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] star [[Sidney Crosby]] hit a bank shot intended for [[Bryan Rust]] while the opposing [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] were on the extra attacker, only for the puck to go into the empty net; coincidentially, the goal was Crosby's 3rd of the game, earning him a [[hat trick]] for the game.<ref>{{cite web | title=In a season defined by stops and starts, Sidney Crosby is finally finding his rhythm – and a little puck luck | url=https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2022/01/22/Sidney-Crosby-Pittsburgh-Penguins/stories/202201220041 }}</ref> In some circumstances, a team may also pull their goalie when they are on a [[power play (sport)|two-man advantage]], even if not nearing the end of the game, to gain an advantage of six attackers to three to even further increase the chances of scoring.
#In the case of a delayed [[penalty (ice hockey)|penalty]], the non-offending team will often pull their goaltender for an extra attacker in this situation as well.  Empty net goals that are scored in this case are accidental [[own goal]]s because the whistle would be blown if the offending team touches the puck. An own goal is usually scored when a [[forward (ice hockey)|forward]] from the non-offending team passes backwards to a [[defenceman (ice hockey)|defenseman]] that is not in position, and the puck slides all the way down the ice into the team's own net, or when players of the non-offending team are being pressured in their own [[Ice hockey rink#Zones|zone]] and they accidentally knock it into the net.  This goal is credited to the last player on the scoring team who touched the puck.

===Goaltender's statistics===

Empty net goals are charged to the goaltender that was previously in net as '''empty net goals against''' (abbreviated as '''EN''', '''ENG''', or '''ENA'''). Empty net goals do not count against a goaltender's [[goals against average]] or their [[save percentage]], but rather are tracked separately. A goaltender can, however, be credited with a loss as the result of an empty net goal (for example, if a team is trailing by one goal, pulls its goalie, concedes an empty net goal, but then scores another but does not score a tying goal before time expires; since no goaltender was on the ice for the game winning goal, the loss is pegged to the last goaltender on the ice). In an unusual case, goaltender [[Adam Wilcox (ice hockey)|Adam Wilcox]], in his [[List of players who played only one game in the NHL|lone NHL appearance]] to date, did not concede a goal but was credited with the loss because of the aforementioned scenario.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://puckprose.com/2018/04/07/buffalo-sabres-adam-wilcox-gets-loss-without-allowing-goal/|title = Buffalo Sabres: Adam Wilcox gets loss without allowing a goal|date = 7 April 2018|access-date = 25 May 2018|archive-date = 26 May 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180526112635/https://puckprose.com/2018/04/07/buffalo-sabres-adam-wilcox-gets-loss-without-allowing-goal/|url-status = dead}}</ref>

==Association football==
An empty net [[Goal (sport)#Association football (soccer)|goal]] can  occur in [[association football|soccer]] in a situation where a team is currently drawing the match or losing by a goal late in a game where the team needs a goal to avoid elimination. Often in these situations the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] of the losing team will go into the attacking area of his team during a [[Set piece (football)|set piece]], such as a [[corner kick]]. In this case it is then possible for the defending team to score into the empty net if they are able to win possession of the ball.

Examples of this include [[Xabi Alonso]] scoring for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] against [[Luton Town]] in the [[FA Cup]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5T_bZ9Jn1U Alonso's empty net goal against Luton Town]</ref> [[Ryan McCann]] scoring for [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] against [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] in the [[Scottish Cup]],<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_cups/7281745.stm Queen of the South 2-0 Dundee]</ref> [[Son Heung-min]] scoring for [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Germany's fate sealed as keeper goes AWOL |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/44635468 |access-date=December 11, 2018 |publisher=BBC |date=June 28, 2018}}</ref> and [[Pity Martínez]] scoring the last goal of his team against [[Boca Juniors]] in the second leg of the [[2018 Copa Libertadores Finals]] at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sanders |first1=Emma |title=Copa Libertadores final: River Plate beat Boca Juniors 3-1 in extra time (agg 5-3) |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46500549 |website=BBC Sport |access-date=10 June 2022 |date=9 December 2018}}</ref>

==Handball==
With rule changes in the 2010s, the goalie can also be pulled in [[handball]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sport.tv2.dk/haandbold/2016-05-12-saadan-fungerer-7-mod-6-reglen-og-de-andre-aendringer|publisher=[[TV2 Danmark]]|website=sport.tv2.dk|title=Sådan fungerer 7 mod 6 reglen - og de andre ændringer|access-date=31 May 2025|language=da}}</ref> Unlike the soccer and ice hockey examples, this is not only done in desperate situations near the end of a game, as scoring even on a goal with a goalkeeper in it is easier in handball than ice hockey or soccer. A loss of ball possession and the inability to quickly get a goalie back in time almost always results in an empty net goal.
