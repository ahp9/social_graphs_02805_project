[[File:Penalty kick Lahm Cech Champions League Final 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Philipp Lahm]] about to take a shot in the [[2012 UEFA Champions League final]] penalty shoot-out]]
In [[association football]], a '''penalty shoot-out''' (previously known as '''kicks from the penalty mark''' and colloquially known as '''penalties''') is a tie-breaking method to determine which team is awarded [[victory]] in a match that cannot end in a [[tie (draw)|draw]], when the score is tied after the normal time as well as [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] (if used) has expired. For example, in a [[FIFA World Cup]], penalties are used in elimination matches; the [[round of 32]], the [[round of 16]], the [[quarter-finals]], the [[semi-finals]], and the [[final (competition)|final]]. In a penalty shoot-out, each team takes turns shooting at goal from the penalty mark, with the goal defended only by the opposing team's [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. Each team has five shots which must be taken by different players; the team that makes more successful kicks is declared the victor. Shoot-outs finish as soon as one team has an insurmountable lead. If scores are level after five pairs of shots, the shootout progresses into additional "[[Sudden death (sport)#Association football|sudden-death]]" rounds.<ref name="Laws">{{cite web |title=Laws of the Game17_Digital_Eng.pdf |url=http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/60/Laws%20of%20the%20Game_16-17_Digital_Eng.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911032912/http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/60/Laws%20of%20the%20Game_16-17_Digital_Eng.pdf |archive-date=11 September 2016 |access-date=27 January 2017 |website=[[IFAB]]}}</ref> Balls successfully kicked into the goal during a shoot-out do not count as goals for the individual kickers or the team, and are tallied separately from the goals scored during normal play (including extra time, if any). Although the procedure for each individual kick in the shoot-out resembles that of a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]], there are some differences. Most notably, neither the kicker nor any player other than the goalkeeper may play the ball again once it has been kicked.

The penalty shoot-out is one of the three methods of breaking a draw that are approved by the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]; the others are extra time and, for [[two-legged tie]]s, the [[away goals rule]].<ref name="Laws" /> A shoot-out is usually used only after one or more of the other methods fail to produce a winner. The method of breaking a draw for a specific match is determined beforehand by the match organising body. In most professional level competitions, two 15-minute extra time periods are played if the score is tied at the end of regulation time, and a shoot-out is held if the score is still tied after the extra time periods.

Although widely employed in football since the 1970s, penalty shoot-outs have been criticised by many followers of the game, due primarily to their perceived reliance on [[luck]] rather than skill and their dependence on individual duels between opposing players, which is arguably not in keeping with football as a [[team sport]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Wilson, M|author2=Wood, G|author3=Jordet, G.|title=The BASES Expert Statement on the Psychological Preparation for Football Penalty Shootouts|url=http://www.bases.org.uk/write/545_Expert_statement_on_Psychological_preparation_for_Football_penalty_shootouts.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106200749/http://www.bases.org.uk/write/545_Expert_statement_on_Psychological_preparation_for_Football_penalty_shootouts.pdf|archive-date=6 January 2016|publisher=British Association of Sports and Exercise Sciences|access-date=28 January 2015}}</ref> However, some believe the pressure and unpredictability involved makes it one of the most thrilling finales to any sport.<ref>{{Cite web |title=World Cup shootouts are great and here is how other sports can adopt the thrilling finale |quote=But all those things combine to make it dramatic and compulsive viewing, the ultimate element of instant unpredictability, a quick fix for both the "short attention span" generation and all the ones before it, too.

==Overview==
During a shoot-out, players other than the kicker and the goalkeepers must remain in the centre circle.<ref name="Laws" /> The kicking team's goalkeeper stands at the intersection of the goal line and the line marking the penalty area ({{convert|16.5|m|yd|0|abbr=in|disp=x|/}}) near one of the assistant referees. Goals scored during the shoot-out are not commonly added to the goalscoring records of the players involved.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

A draw is a common result in football. Shoot-outs are only used in competitions that require a match-winner at the end of the game<ref name="Laws" /> – this is predominantly in [[single-elimination tournament|knockout "cup" ties]], as opposed to [[round-robin tournament|round-robin "leagues"]]; they decide which team progresses to the next round of a tournament, or wins it. Usually [[extra time]] has been played first, but this is not necessary;<ref name="Laws" /> exceptions include the [[Copa Libertadores]], [[Copa América]] (quarter-finals, semi-finals, and third-place game), [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] (quarter-finals and semi-finals), [[FA Community Shield]], the [[EFL League Cup]], and the [[Football League Trophy]], all of which use shoot-outs straight after the end of normal time.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-12-17 |title=Tournament Regulations |url=https://www.concacaf.com/en/gold-cup/regulations/ |access-date=2025-07-01 |website=Gold Cup |language=en}}</ref>
 
The rules of some competitions provide that a shoot-out may be used to decide placings in a round-robin group, in the unusual event that two teams who have faced each other in a final-day match finish the group with identical statistics, and no other team has the same record. This was invoked in Group A of the [[2003 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship]], in which Italy and Sweden held a shootout immediately after their drawn match.<ref>{{cite web

</ref> This rule is a relatively recent innovation, and for example did not apply in [[1990 FIFA World Cup#Group F|Group F of the 1990 World Cup]], where the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] were separated by drawing of lots immediately after drawing their final-day match,<ref>{{cite book |author=FIFA Technical Study Group |title=FIFA World Cup Italia'90: Official Report |publisher=FIFA |year=1990 |page=59 |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/techdevp/fwc_italy_1990_a_part2_277.pdf |quote=So the last two matches in Group F would decide whether teams could proceed forward by their own efforts, or make FIFA resort to drawing lots in Rome.

Several leagues, such as the [[J.League]],<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hirata, T.|author2=Szymanski, S.|editor1-last=Lee|editor1-first=YH|editor2-last=Fort|editor2-first=R|title=The Sports Business in The Pacific Rim|publisher=Sports Economics, Management and Policy|chapter=The J. League and the World Cup}}</ref> have experimented with penalty shoot-outs immediately following a drawn league match, with the winner being awarded an extra [[points (association football)|point]]. In the United States and Canada, [[Major League Soccer]] initially also had a shoot-out immediately following the end of full-time, even during league matches, although these shoot-outs differed from standard penalty shoot-outs (see below). The final few seasons of the [[Yugoslav First League]] before the country's collapse eliminated draws in favour of penalty shoot-outs, with the winner getting one point and the loser getting nothing. This practice was controversial and unpopular and was derisively referred to as "Šajber's penalties" after [[Slavko Šajber]], the president of the Yugoslav FA who pushed for the change.

A team that loses a penalty shoot-out is eliminated from the tournament while the winning team in the shoot-out advances to the next round or is crowned champion but the match is classed as a draw by FIFA. For instance, the Netherlands are considered to have concluded the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] undefeated, despite being eliminated at the semi-final stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=7/news=van-gaal-we-can-still-make-history-2403702.html|title=Van Gaal: We can still make history|website=FIFA.com|date=11 July 2014|access-date=3 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129004925/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=7/news=van-gaal-we-can-still-make-history-2403702.html|archive-date=29 January 2018}}</ref>

==Procedure==
The following is a summary of the procedure for kicks from the penalty mark. The procedure is specified in Law 10 ("Determining the Outcome of a Match") of the ''Laws of the Game'' (p.&nbsp;71).<ref name="Laws" />

[[File:Hearts vs. Gretna Scottish Cup final.jpg|thumb|[[Steven Pressley]] scores for [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] against [[Gretna FC|Gretna]] in the [[2006 Scottish Cup Final]] shoot-out]]
[[File:Didier Drogba Manuel Neuer last penalty kick Champions League Final 2012.jpg|thumb|Deciding penalty kick of [[Didier Drogba]] in the [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final]]]]
# The referee [[Coin flipping|tosses a coin]] to decide the goal at which the kicks are taken. The choice of goal may be changed by the referee for safety reasons or if the goal or playing surface becomes unusable.<ref name="Laws"/>
# The referee tosses the coin a second time to determine which team takes the first kick.
# All players other than the kicker and the goalkeepers must remain in the [[Association football pitch|pitch]]'s centre circle (see above).
# Each kick is taken in the general manner of a penalty kick. Each kick is taken from the [[Penalty area|penalty mark]], which is {{convert|11|m|yd|abbr=in}} from the goal line and equidistant from each touch line, with the goal defended only by the opposing goalkeeper. The goalkeeper must remain between the goal posts on their goal line until the ball has been kicked, although they can jump in place, wave their arms, move side to side along the goal line, or otherwise try to distract the shooter.
# Each team is responsible for setting the order in which its eligible players take kicks.
# Each kicker can kick the ball only once. Once kicked, the kicker may not play the ball again. 
# No other player on either team, other than the designated kicker and goalkeeper, may touch the ball.<ref name="Laws" />
# A kick results in a goal scored for the kicking team if, having been touched once by the kicker, the ball crosses the goal line between the goal posts and under the crossbar, without touching any player, official, or outside agent other than the defending goalkeeper. The ball may touch the goalkeeper, goal posts, or crossbar any number of times before going into the goal as long as the referee believes the ball's motion is the result of the initial kick. This was clarified after an incident in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] shoot-out between [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[France national football team|France]]. [[Bruno Bellone]]'s kick rebounded out off the post, hit goalkeeper [[Carlos Roberto Gallo|Carlos]]'s back, and subsequently bounced into the goal. Referee [[Ioan Igna]] gave the goal to France, and Brazil captain [[Edino Nazareth Filho|Edinho]] was booked for protesting that the kick should have been considered a miss as soon as it rebounded off the post. In 1987, the [[International Football Association Board]] clarified Law&nbsp;14, covering penalty kicks, to support Igna's decision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corshamref.org.uk/newsletter/news06jul.htm |date=July 2006 |title=The Corsham Referee Newsletter |first=Julian |last=Carosi |access-date=20 June 2008 |number=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006164438/http://corshamref.org.uk/newsletter/news06jul.htm |archive-date=6 October 2008 }} and {{cite book |chapter-url=http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1987/1987app.pdf |title=Minutes of the AGM |publisher=Soccer South Bay Referee Association |location=Llandudno |date=13 June 1987 |access-date=29 November 2009 |pages=18–22 |chapter=III.8(a) Proposal by the Scottish Football Association: Law XIV—Penalty Kick |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430130743/http://ssbra.org/html/laws/IFABarc/pdf/1987/1987app.pdf |archive-date=30 April 2011 }}

# Teams take turns to kick from the penalty mark, until each has taken five kicks. However, if one side has scored more goals than the other could possibly reach with all of its remaining kicks, the shoot-out immediately ends, regardless of the number of kicks remaining; this basis is called "best-of-five kicks". In the 2006 World Cup final, for example, the shoot-out ended after Italy's [[Fabio Grosso]] had scored his team's fifth, despite the fact that France (on three) still had one more shot to take. Similarly, in the [[2022 FIFA World Cup Final]], [[Gonzalo Montiel]]'s successful conversion of Argentina's fourth kick won the trophy, despite France and Argentina both having one kick left.
# If after five rounds of kicks, the teams have scored an equal number of goals (or neither team has scored any goals), additional rounds of one kick each are used until one team scores and the other misses. This is known as [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]].
# The team that scores the most goals at the end of the shoot-out is the winner of the match.
# Only players who were on the pitch at the end of play or temporarily absent (injured, adjusting equipment etc.) are allowed to participate in the shoot-out.<ref name="Laws" /> If at the end of the match and before or during the kicks one side has more players on the pitch than the other, whether as a result of injury or red cards, then the side with more players must reduce its numbers to match the opponents; this is known as "reduce to equate". For example, if Team&nbsp;A has eleven players but Team&nbsp;B only has ten, then Team&nbsp;A chooses one player to exclude. Players excluded this way may take no further part in the procedure, either as kicker or goalkeeper, except that they can be used to replace a goalkeeper who becomes injured during the shootout. The rule was introduced by the International Football Association Board in February 2000 because previously an eleventh kick would be taken by the eleventh (i.e. weakest) player of a full-strength team and the first (i.e. strongest) player of a sub-strength team.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/developing/refereeing/news/newsid=74400.html |title=The Laws change and the game gets better |publisher=[[FIFA]] |date=1 August 2000 |access-date=30 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514104336/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/developing/refereeing/news/newsid%3D74400.html |archive-date=14 May 2008 }}

# If a goalkeeper is sent off during the shoot-out, another player who finished the game must act as goalkeeper.<ref name="Laws" />
# If a player, other than the goalkeeper, becomes injured or is sent off during the shoot-out, then the shoot-out continues with no substitution allowed. The opposing team must reduce its numbers accordingly.<ref name="Laws" />
# Any player remaining on the pitch may act as the goalkeeper, and it is ''not'' required for the same player to have acted as a goalkeeper during the game.
# No player is allowed to take a second kick until all other eligible players on their team have taken a first kick, including the goalkeeper.
# If it becomes necessary for players to take another kick (because the score has remained equal after all eligible players have taken their first kick), players are not required to kick in the same order.<ref name="Laws" />
# Kicks from the penalty mark must not be delayed for a player who leaves the field of play. The player's kick is forfeited (not scored) if the player does not return in time to take a kick.
# The referee must not abandon the match if, during the kicks, a team is reduced to fewer than seven players.<ref name="Laws" />

==Tactics==
{{main|Penalty kick (association football)#Tactics}}
Defending against a penalty kick is one of the most difficult tasks a goalkeeper can face. Some decide which way they will dive beforehand, giving themselves time to reach the side of the goalmouth. A 2011 study published in the journal ''Psychological Science'' found goalkeepers dived to the right 71% of the time when their team was losing, but only 48% when ahead and 49% when tied, a phenomenon believed to be related to certain right-preferring behaviour in social mammals.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/08/02/138922339/under-pressure-soccer-goalies-tend-to-dive-right|title=Under Pressure, Soccer Goalies Tend To Dive Right|newspaper=NPR |date=2 August 2011|access-date=3 September 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803010726/http://www.npr.org/2011/08/02/138922339/under-pressure-soccer-goalies-tend-to-dive-right|archive-date=3 August 2011}}</ref> Others try to read the kicker's motion pattern. Kickers may attempt to feint, or delay their shot to see which way the keeper dives. Shooting high and centre, in the space that the keeper will evacuate, carries the highest risk of shooting above the bar.<ref>How to actually, seriously play soccer 2007/2008, p.130: "Don't shoot right down the pipe"</ref> If a keeper blocks a penalty kick during a match, there is a danger the kicker or a teammate may score from the rebound; this is not relevant in the case of a shoot-out.

Since the entire shoot-out is conducted at the same goal, the crowd behind the goal may favour one team and try to distract the other team's shooters. To forestall any potential advantage, in 2016 the Laws of the Game were modified to add a coin toss between the two teams prior to the shoot-out: the winner of the coin toss has the right to decide which goal is used for the shoot-out (previously, the decision was at the referee's discretion). The referee may change the goal only for safety reasons or if the selected goal or pitch are unusable.<ref name="Laws"/>

A goalkeeper may not use distracting gamesmanship such as cleaning their boots or asking the referee to see if the ball is placed properly; this risks a [[Misconduct (association football)#Cautionable offences (yellow card)|caution]] for [[unsporting conduct]]. [[Bruce Grobbelaar]]'s "wobbly legs" clowning distracted [[Francesco Graziani]] in the [[1984 European Cup Final]] shootout.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hart |first1=Simon |title=European Cup Final: Home truths from Rome |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/european-cup-final-home-truths-rome-7766965.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220525/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/european-cup-final-home-truths-rome-7766965.html |archive-date=25 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |access-date=21 November 2020 |work=The Independent |date=18 May 2012}}</ref> The keeper is forbidden from moving off the goal line to narrow the shooter's angle; the [[2003 UEFA Champions League Final]] shootout caused controversy as replays showed that both keepers got away with this, as did [[Jerzy Dudek]] in the [[2005 Champions League Final]].{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

Tactics used by goalkeepers to reduce the probability of kickers succeeding with their kicks include:<ref>{{cite web |title=Tim Krul and the Greatest Substitute Ever Made {{!}} The Long Walk On FIFA+ |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMF6uu_HpZk |website=YouTube | date=10 November 2022 |publisher=FIFA |access-date=17 June 2025}}</ref>
*Visually distracting the kicker (e.g., pointing, gesturing)
*Verbally irritating, annoying or provoking the kicker
*Physically confronting the kicker
*Delaying the kicker (e.g., the goalkeeper taking a long time to position themself for the kick)

==History==
===Origins===
Between 1867 and 1970, the laws of association football [[Determining the Outcome of a Match (association football)#History|did not provide for a method of breaking ties]]. The first association football tournament, the [[FA Cup]], used extra time and replays to decide drawn games. This example was followed by other early knockout competitions.
In the early 1920s, some charity matches began using [[corner-kicks]] as a tie-breaker in order to avoid replays.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Athletic News |date=2 April 1923 |page=1 |title=En Passant |quote=This change is not quite so unnecessary as it might appear, for matches have been decided by corner-kicks to prevent replays in charity games late in the season.}}</ref> In response, the laws of the game were amended in 1923 to state explicitly that the goal was the only means of scoring, and that a match that ended with equal number of goals scored was drawn.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1923)|quote=A game shall be won by the team scoring the greater number of goals. If no goals have been scored, or the scores are equal at the end of the game, the game shall be drawn|sign=|source=}}</ref>

In major competitions, when a [[replay (sports)|replay]] or [[One-game playoff|playoff]] was not possible, ties were previously broken by drawing of lots. Examples include [[Italy national football team|Italy]]'s win over the [[USSR national football team|USSR]] in the semi-final of the [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968 European Championship]] (the final, also drawn, went to a replay).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rsssf.org/tables/68e.html |title=European Championship 1968 |first1=Karel |last1=Stokkermans |first2=Martín | last2=Tabeira |date=7 February 2007 |access-date=19 June 2008 |website=[[RSSSF]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622211438/http://www.rsssf.com/tables/68e.html |archive-date=22 June 2008 }}

However, variants of the modern shoot-out were used before then in several domestic competitions and minor tournaments. Domestic examples include the [[Yugoslav Cup]] from 1952,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablesj/joegcupdetail.html |title=Cup of Yugoslavia 1952 |first=Dinant |last=Abbink |date=6 June 2008 |access-date=15 July 2008 |website=[[RSSSF]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174325/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesj/joegcupdetail.html#52 |archive-date=3 March 2016 }}

[[File:Selecció Barcelona 0–0 UE Centelles penalty shoot-out.png|thumb|Barcelona women converting a kick during the penalty shoot-out on 25 December 1970]]
In England, the first penalty shoot-out in a professional match took place in 1970 at [[Boothferry Park]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], between [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] during the semi-final of the [[Watney Cup]], and was won by Manchester United. The first player to take a kick was [[George Best]], and the first to miss was [[Denis Law]]. [[Ian McKechnie]], who saved Law's kick, was also the first goalkeeper to take a kick; his shot hit the crossbar and deflected over, putting Hull City out of the Cup.

Penalty shoot-outs were used to decide matches in UEFA's [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] and [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] in the 1970–71 season. On 30 September 1970, after a 4–4 aggregate draw in [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1970-71#First round|the first round of the Cup Winners' Cup]], [[Budapest Honvéd FC|Honvéd]] won the first shoot-out 5–4 against [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linguasport.com/futbol/internacional/clubes/c2/C2_71.htm |title=Cup Winners' Cup 1970–71 |publisher=linguasport.com |language=en |access-date=22 January 2016 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930021314/http://www.linguasport.com/futbol/internacional/clubes/c2/C2_71.htm |archive-date=30 September 2016 }}</ref> when [[Jim Forrest (footballer born 1944)|Jim Forrest]]'s shot hit the bar.

A [[Selecció Barcelona 0–0 UE Centelles|friendly cup game]] between the [[FC Barcelona Femení|Barcelona women's team]] and UE Centelles went to penalty shoot-out in December 1970. The format of this shoot-out had penalty kicks taken in sets of three, with Barcelona kicking three, then Centelles kicking three. After two rounds of this continued to produce matching results, the shoot-out was taken to sudden death.<ref>{{cite web|date=2020-12-24|title=La història del futbol femení del Barça comença amb setze heroïnes|url=https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/futbol-femenino-barca/fc-barcelona-futbol-femenino-camp-nou-seleccio-barcelona-centelles-immacualda-cabeceran-11420004|access-date=2023-06-07|website=Sport|language=ca}}</ref>

In the first round of the [[European Cup 1972–73]], the referee prematurely ended a shoot-out between [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]] and [[Panathinaikos FC|Panathinaikos]], with CSKA leading 3–2 but Panathinaikos having taken only four kicks. Panathinaikos complained to UEFA and the match was annulled and replayed the following month,<ref>{{cite news |title=UEFA annul Cup result |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=9 October 1972 |work=[[The Times]] |page=7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Derby could silence their critics|last=Barham |first=Albert |date=25 October 1972|work=[[The Guardian]] |page=27 }}
</ref> with CSKA winning without the need for a shoot-out.

The final of the [[1973 Campeonato Paulista]] ended in similar circumstances. [[Santos F.C.|Santos]] were leading [[Associação Portuguesa de Desportos|Portuguesa]] 2–0 with each team having taken three shoot-out kicks, when referee Armando Marques mistakenly (as each team still had two shots to take, and therefore Portuguesa still had a chance of levelling the scoreline) declared Santos the winners. Portuguesa manager [[Otto Glória]] quickly led his team out of the stadium; this was allegedly to ensure the shoot-out could not resume once the mistake was discovered, and that instead the match would be replayed, giving Portuguesa a better chance of victory. When Santos counter-objected to a replay, Paulista&nbsp;FA president Osvaldo Teixeira Duarte annulled the original match and declared both teams joint champions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cartaovermelho.com.br/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=35&theme=Printer |title=Decisão do Campeonato Paulista de 1973 |author=Reportagem CV |date=26 August 2003 |publisher=cartaovermelho.com.br |language=pt |access-date=26 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706151624/http://www.cartaovermelho.com.br/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=35&theme=Printer |archive-date=6 July 2011 }}

The first major international tournament to be decided by a penalty shoot-out was the [[1976 European Football Championship|1976 European Championship]] final between [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]].

</ref> Czechoslovakia won the shootout 5–3, with the deciding kick being converted by [[Antonín Panenka]] with a "[[Panenka (penalty kick)|chip]]" after [[Uli Hoeneß]] had put the previous kick over the crossbar.

The first penalty shoot-out in the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] was on 9 January 1977, in [[1978 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)#First round|the first round of African qualifying]], when [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] beat [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/fifaworldcuppreliminaryhistory_byyear__13876.pdf |author=Communications Division |title=History of the FIFA World Cup Preliminary Competition (by year) |date=27 July 2007 |work=Good to Know |publisher=[[FIFA]] |page=22 |access-date=5 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615220946/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/fifaworldcuppreliminaryhistory_byyear__13876.pdf |archive-date=15 June 2010 }}

==Famous incidents==
===Internationals===
The finals of nine [[FIFA]] 11-a-side tournaments, including three men's World Cups, have gone to penalty shoot-outs. Some of the notable matches are as follows.
*The [[1991 FIFA World Youth Championship#Final|1991 FIFA World Youth Championship final]] between [[Portugal national under-20 football team|Portugal]] and [[Brazil national under-20 football team|Brazil]] in [[Lisbon]] was decided on a penalty shoot-out which the Portuguese won 4–2, with the last shot coming from [[Rui Costa]].
*In the [[1994 FIFA World Cup final]] at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], California, the match between [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] ended goalless after extra time. Brazil went on to win the shoot-out 3–2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/pwc/mr_3104.html|title=1994 FIFA World Cup USA (TM) Brazil - Italy|website=FIFA.com|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association|access-date=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302011553/http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/pwc/mr_3104.html|archive-date=2 March 2007}}</ref>
*In the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final]], also held at the Rose Bowl, the match between hosts the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States]] and [[China women's national football team|China]] ended goalless after extra time as well. The United States went on to win the shoot-out 5–4, becoming the first host country to win the tournament.
*The [[2006 FIFA World Cup final]] between France and Italy also went to a penalty shoot-out (after a 1–1 draw followed by a scoreless 30 minutes of extra time) and was won by [[Italy national football team|Italy]] 5–3 against [[France national football team|France]] in [[Berlin]]'s [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)|Olympic Stadium]], winning their fourth world title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/match/64/mr.html|title=Italy - France	|website=FIFA.com|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association|access-date=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811010105/http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/match/64/mr.html|archive-date=11 August 2006}}</ref>
*In the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup final]], held at [[Waldstadion (Frankfurt)|Waldstadion]] in [[Frankfurt]], the match between the United States and [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]] ended 2–2 after extra time. This time, the United States ended up on the losing side. Japan won the shoot-out 3–1, thus becoming the first Asian country to win the senior—either men's or women's—World Cup.
*The [[2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup#Final|2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup final]] in [[Istanbul]] went to a penalty shoot-out after a 0–0 draw after extra time. [[France national under-20 football team|France]] won 4–1 over [[Uruguay national under-20 football team|Uruguay]]. It was their first U-20 World Cup title, thus became the first nation to win all five FIFA 11-a-side men's titles (FIFA World Cup, FIFA Confederations Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, and the Olympic football tournament).
*The [[2022 FIFA World Cup final]] between France and Argentina went to penalty shoot-out after the extra time ended with a 3–3 draw.

Goalkeepers have been known to win shoot-outs by their kicking. For example, in a [[UEFA Euro 2004]] quarter-final match, [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] goalkeeper [[Ricardo (footballer, born 1976)|Ricardo]] saved a kick (without gloves) from [[England national football team|England]]'s [[Darius Vassell]] and then scored the winning shot.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/3830451.stm | work=BBC News | title=Portugal break England hearts | date=24 June 2004 | access-date=22 May 2020 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417090356/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2004/3830451.stm | archive-date=17 April 2009 }}</ref> Another example is [[Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield|Vélez Sársfield]]'s [[José Luis Chilavert]] in the [[1994 Copa Libertadores Finals]]. (Chilavert had a reputation as a dead-ball specialist and scored 41 goals during his club career.). More recently, in the [[2023 Africa Cup of Nations|2023 African Cup of Nations]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo national football team|DR Congo]]'s [[Lionel Mpasi]] shot the ball into the top right-hand corner against [[Mohamed Abou Gabal|Mohamed Gabaski]], who had been a penalty-saving specialist in Egypt's run to the final in Cameroon two years prior.<ref>{{Cite news |title=DR Congo knock Egypt out of Afcon on penalties |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/68045654 |access-date=2024-01-29 |work=BBC Sport |language=en-GB}}</ref>

[[Antonín Panenka]] ([[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]) decided the penalty shoot-out at the [[UEFA Euro 1976 Final]] against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] with a [[Panenka (penalty kick)|famous chip]] to the middle of the goal.

The England national team has lost seven (out of ten) penalty shoot-outs in major tournament finals, including losses to Germany in the semi-finals of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 1996]] (the latter following a win over Spain by the same method in the previous round). After Euro 1996, England lost four more shoot-outs in a row in major tournament finals, losing to Argentina at the 1998 World Cup, Portugal at Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup and Italy at Euro 2012, before finally breaking their losing streak at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]] against Colombia; this shoot-out also allowed England to progress into the quarter-finals for the first time in twelve years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-cup/2018/07/03/england-vs-colombia-world-cup-2018-live-score-harry-kane-latest/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-cup/2018/07/03/england-vs-colombia-world-cup-2018-live-score-harry-kane-latest/ |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=England banish penalty curse to pass Colombia test and reach World Cup quarter-final: live reaction|last1=Wallace|first1=Sam|date=3 July 2018|work=The Telegraph|access-date=3 July 2018|last2=Tyers|first2=Alan|issn=0307-1235}}{{cbignore}}</ref> England again lost a penalty shoot-out to Italy in the [[UEFA Euro 2020 Final]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=England lose shootout in Euro 2020 final|language=en-GB|work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51198762|first=Phil |last=McNulty|access-date=12 July 2021|date=11 July 2021}}</ref> They won their following penalty shootout against Switzerland in the UEFA Euro 2024 Quarter Finals.

The Netherlands, meanwhile, lost four consecutive shoot-outs: against Denmark in Euro 1992, France in Euro 1996, Brazil in the 1998 World Cup, and Italy in Euro 2000, before finally winning one against Sweden in Euro 2004. In [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], the Netherlands had two penalty kicks during the match and four attempts in the shoot-out but only managed to convert one kick against Italian keeper [[Francesco Toldo]]. [[Frank de Boer]] had both a penalty kick and shoot-out kick saved by Toldo, who also saved from [[Paul Bosvelt]] to give Italy a 3–1 shoot-out victory. The Netherlands' fortunes seemed to improve during the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]], when they defeated Costa Rica on penalty kicks in their quarter-final match, only to lose their semi-final match against Argentina on penalties. The [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cup]] saw their losing a shoot-out against Argentina once again, but this time in the quarter-finals.

The Italians have lost six shoot-outs in major championships, including three consecutive World Cups (1990–1998, including the 1994 final), the Euro 2008 quarter-finals, and the Euro 2016 quarter-finals. However, they have also won five shoot-outs, including the Euro 2000 semi-final against the Netherlands, the Euro 2012 quarter-final against England, the 2006 World Cup final against France, the Euro 2020 semi-final against Spain, and the Euro 2020 final against England.

On 16 November 2005, a place in the World Cup was directly determined by a penalty shoot-out for the first time. The [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL – OFC play-off)|qualifying playoff]] between [[Australia men's national soccer team|Australia]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] ended 1–1 on aggregate; Uruguay won the first leg 1–0 [[Estadio Centenario|at home]], and Australia won the second leg at [[Stadium Australia|home]] by the same score. A scoreless 30 minutes of extra time were followed by a shoot-out, which Australia won 4–2. This occurred again twice in qualifying matches for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], first on 29 March 2022 in the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – CAF third round|CAF third round]] between [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] and [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]], which Senegal won 3–1 on penalties after the two legs ended 1–1 on aggregate, and on 13 June 2022 in the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC–CONMEBOL play-off)|AFC-CONMEBOL qualifying playoff]] between Australia and [[Peru national football team|Peru]], which Australia won 5–4 on penalties after the only fixture in the playoff went to a 0–0 draw. Delays due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] caused only one match to be played in neutral Qatar, rather than the traditional home-and-away playoff fixture.

During the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] set an unwanted new record in the round&nbsp;of&nbsp;16 shoot-out against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] by failing to convert any of their penalties, losing 3–0. The goalkeeper [[Oleksandr Shovkovskyi]] ([[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]]) became the first not to concede a single goal in the penalty shoot-out, saving two of the Swiss attempts, with another shot hitting the crossbar. The result meant that Switzerland became the first nation to be eliminated from the World Cup without conceding any goals (and, moreover, the only nation to participate in a World Cup finals tournament without conceding a goal). Despite this loss, Switzerland beat France 5–4 on penalties in the [[UEFA Euro 2016 knockout phase#France vs Switzerland|Euro 2020 round of 16]].

The same competition featured a shoot-out between Germany and Argentina, the two most successful teams up to that point in terms of World Cup finals penalty shoot-outs: Each team had competed in three shoot-outs and won all of them. Germany won the shoot-out, leaving Germany alone with a 4–0 record in World Cup finals.

On 20 June 2007, a new UEFA record was established.<ref>{{cite web

The Netherlands eventually won the shoot-out 13–12.

===Domestic cups===
In the [[FA Cup]], penalty kicks were used in the 1972 edition of the short-lived [[FA Cup third-fourth place matches|third-place playoff]]. They were introduced more generally in the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92 season]] to decide matches still level after one replay and extra time. Previously there was no limit on the number of replays, which led to fixture disruption, especially disliked by the top clubs. Replays were often two or three days after the drawn match, which conflicted with the increased planning required after the [[Football Spectators Act 1989]]. The first team eliminated from the FA Cup on penalties was [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], beaten on 26 October 1991 by [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] after a first-round replay.<ref name="CoxRussell2002">{{cite book|editor1-last=Cox|editor1-first=Richard William|editor2-last=Russell|editor2-first=Dave|editor3-last=Vamplew|editor3-first=Wray|first= John |last=Coyle |title=Encyclopedia of British football|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKbb02bg6zYC&pg=PA265 |access-date=27 June 2010|date=3 September 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7146-5249-8|page=265|chapter=Replays}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/cup2.sd?competitionid=58&seasonid=121|title=English FA Cup – 1991/1992|publisher=soccerbase.com|access-date=27 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504045132/http://www.soccerbase.com/cup2.sd?competitionid=58&seasonid=121|archive-date=4 May 2008}}</ref> A shoot-out was first used in the [[FA Cup Final]] in 2005, when [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] beat [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 5–4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2005/04/FACF_Preview1.htm |title=TheFA.com - Lehmann makes history |website=www.thefa.com |access-date=3 February 2022 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20080708225448/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2005/04/FACF_Preview1.htm |archive-date=8 July 2008 }}</ref> The [[2006 FA Cup Final|following year]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] beat [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the FA Cup Final's second ever penalty shoot-out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2006/05/FACF06_MatchReport.htm |title=TheFA.com - Reds in seventh heaven |website=www.thefa.com |access-date=3 February 2022 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20080518095426/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2006/05/FACF06_MatchReport.htm |archive-date=18 May 2008 }}</ref>

On 31 August 2005, a new English record was established when a shoot-out between [[Tunbridge Wells F.C.|Tunbridge Wells]] and [[Littlehampton Town F.C.|Littlehampton Town]] in an FA Cup replay involved 40 kicks being taken, with Tunbridge Wells winning 16–15.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/News/2005/Sep/FAC_TunbridgePenaltyRecord|title=Wells' shoot-out record|publisher=The FA|date=2 September 2005|access-date=1 July 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130203190722/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/News/2005/Sep/FAC_TunbridgePenaltyRecord|archive-date=3 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tunbridgewellsfc.co.uk/news.asp?offset=-1 |title=Latest news |publisher=Tunbridge Wells FC |access-date=19 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208120551/http://www.tunbridgewellsfc.co.uk/news.asp?offset=-1 |archive-date=8 February 2013 }}</ref>

Shoot-outs have been used to settle six [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] finals to date. The first was in [[2001 Football League Cup Final|2001]] when [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] beat [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 5–4 on penalties after a 1–1 draw after extra time in the match. The second was the [[2009 Football League Cup Final|2009 final]] between [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] ended goalless and was won 4–1 on penalties by Manchester United. Then the [[2012 Football League Cup Final|2012 final]] between [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] finished 2–2 after extra time, Liverpool winning 3–2 on penalties. The [[2016 Football League Cup Final|2016 final]] was won by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] beating Liverpool 3–1 on penalties, after a 1–1 draw. Manchester City also won the [[2019 EFL Cup Final|2019 final]] 4–3 on penalties after a 0–0 draw with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Chelsea then went on to lose the [[2022 EFL Cup Final|2022 final]] 11–10 on penalties to Liverpool.

Penalty shoot-outs have been used for many years to settle drawn games in the earlier rounds of the [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]], the earliest example being August 1976 when [[Doncaster Rovers]] beat [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] 3–2 on penalties after three drawn games in a row (1–1, 1–1, 2–2) in a first round match. Shoot-outs tend to be quite rare in the semi-finals due to the [[away goals rule]] applying after extra time. However, a shoot-out was used in the [[2013-14 Football League Cup|2013–14 semi-final]] between [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]] and Manchester United after both teams finished level over two legs; Sunderland won the shoot-out 2–1.

The [[FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] is also settled using penalties, following the normal 90 minutes of play, but no extra time. [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] have won the shield three times via a shoot-out, beating [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in [[2003 FA Community Shield|2003]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in [[2007 FA Community Shield|2007]], and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in [[2008 FA Community Shield|2008]]. Manchester United lost the [[2009 FA Community Shield|2009]] match on penalties to Chelsea.

In 2008, the [[2007–08 Turkish Cup|Turkish Cup Final]] featured two clubs outside of Istanbul's Top Three for the first time in two decades, but penalty kicks decided the winner between [[Gençlerbirliği S.K.|Gençlerbirliği]] and [[Kayserispor]], the latter having reached the final for the first time ever. After a scoreless 120 minutes, 28 penalty kicks were needed to decide the outcome, and Kayserispor, thanks to the goal scoring and goal saving heroics of [[Dimitar Ivankov]], won its first [[Turkish Cup]] 11–10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/news/newsid=2075236/|title=Kayserispor triumph in 28-penalty shootout|website=FIFA.com|date=7 May 2013|access-date=3 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606181033/http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/news/newsid=2075236/|archive-date=6 June 2015}}</ref>

In the [[2009 Greek Football Cup Final|2008–09 Greek Cup final]] [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK]] took a 3–2 lead at 89' with a goal by [[Ignacio Scocco|Scocco]]; however [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] came back from the dead at the dying seconds of stoppage time (90'+6) with a goal by [[Matt Derbyshire|Derbyshire]], to force an overtime. While Olympiacos took a 4–3 lead in overtime with a goal by [[Luciano Galletti|Galletti]], the scorer was sent off with a second yellow card for taking his shirt off while celebrating. Later on, [[Avraam Papadopoulos]] also got a second yellow leaving Olympiacos with 9 players. AEK managed to tie the game at 4–4 forcing a penalty shoot out.

AEK was shooting first. Both AEK and Olympiacos scored in the first 4 penalties. [[Daniel Majstorović|Majstorovic]] of AEK hit the horizontal crossbar in the 5th penalty giving the chance to [[Predrag Đorđević|Djordjevic]] (for whom it was the closing game of his career) to seal the victory for Olympiacos. However, his shot was blocked by AEK's Argentinian goalkeeper [[Sebastián Saja|Saja]]. Hence, the shooting continued. Both teams scored their 6th and 7th penalties. Center-back [[Paraskevas Antzas|Antzas]] was slotted to hit the 8th penalty for Olympiacos, but keeper [[Antonios Nikopolidis|Nikopolidis]] took the initiative and took the penalty instead tying the score to 7–7. Nikopolidis blocked the subsequent (9th) penalty by [[Nikolaos Georgeas|Georgeas]] for AEK but Antzas missed the penalty for Olympiacos (saved by Saha) and failed to finish the shoot-out.

Since Olympiacos had only 9 players in the field, the shooters had to rotate, going back to those that shoot the very first penalties. All 7 subsequent penalty takers for both teams scored, leading to a penalty shoot out that was at 14–14 with 32 penalty shots having been taken. However, [[Agustín Pelletieri|Pelletieri]] of AEK had a bad penalty shot that was easily deflected by Nikopolidis, who then took the 34th penalty shot against the other goalkeeper, Saja, scoring, and ending this saga with a 15–14 win for Olympiacos in penalty shoot out and an overall score of 19–18. ([[2008–09 Greek Cup]]).

===UEFA club competitions===
The first penalty shoot-out in a European Cup final occurred in the [[1984 European Cup Final]] as [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] defeated [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. The match is best known for the antics of Liverpool keeper [[Bruce Grobbelaar]]. As Roma's [[Bruno Conti]] prepared to take his kick, Grobbelaar walked towards the goal smiling confidently at the cameras lined-up behind, then proceeded to bite the back of the net, in imitation of eating spaghetti. Conti sent his spot kick over the bar. Grobbelaar then produced a similar performance before [[Francesco Graziani]] took his kick, famously wobbling his legs in mock terror. Graziani duly missed and Liverpool went on to win the shootout 4–2.

In the [[1986 European Cup Final]] between [[CSA Steaua București (football)|Steaua București]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], Steaua keeper [[Helmut Duckadam]] saved all four of Barca's penalties, for which he was dubbed "the hero of [[Seville]]".<ref>{{cite news |title=Steaua's story |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8184991.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=5 August 2009 |access-date=7 August 2009 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090806101018/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8184991.stm| archive-date= 6 August 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Steaua also missed two, but still prevailed 2–0 in the shoot-out to become the only Romanian club side to win the title.

In the [[2003 UEFA Champions League Final]] the penalty-shoot out has caused controversy among many fans as replays showed that [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] goalkeeper [[Dida (footballer, born 1973)|Dida]] was off his goal line when saving penalties from [[David Trezeguet|Trezeguet]], [[Marcelo Zalayeta|Zalayeta]] and [[Paolo Montero|Montero]]. [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] keeper [[Gianluigi Buffon|Buffon]] was also off his goal line when saving penalties from [[Clarence Seedorf|Seedorf]] and [[Kakha Kaladze|Kaladze]].

In the [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final]] between Milan and Liverpool, Liverpool keeper [[Jerzy Dudek]] used tactics similar to [[Bruce Grobbelaar]] in 1984 (known as the "Dudek dance" in 2005) to distract the Milan shootout takers which resulted in a victory for his team.

The [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final]] between [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] went to penalties, when [[John Terry]] missed a penalty which would have won Chelsea the match (and the Champions League). His standing leg slipped as he took his kick, and the ball hit the post. Chelsea lost the shoot-out 6–5, to which Terry reacted by breaking down in tears. Terry was not originally the penalty taker, however, striker [[Didier Drogba]] had been sent off shortly before extra time ended.

In the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League between [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[Iker Casillas]] and [[Manuel Neuer]] each saved two spot kicks. Neuer kept out penalties from [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] (£80 million) and [[Kaká]] (£56 million), then the most expensive footballers in history from their transfer fees.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/champions-league/9226202/Real-Madrid-2-Bayern-Munich-1-agg-3-3-Bayern-win-3-1-on-pens-match-report.html |title=Bayern Munich reach Champions League final after beating Real Madrid in dramatic penalty shoot-out |newspaper=Telegraph |date=26 April 2012 |access-date=19 May 2012 |location=London |first=Henry |last=Winter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425225935/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/champions-league/9226202/Real-Madrid-2-Bayern-Munich-1-agg-3-3-Bayern-win-3-1-on-pens-match-report.html |archive-date=25 April 2012 }}</ref>

On 19 May 2012, Chelsea defeated Bayern Munich 4–3 on penalties in the [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final]]. Chelsea had never previously won a shoot-out in the competition, and had lost the 2008 final and 2007 semi-final on penalties. Bayern had never lost a shoot-out in Europe; their wins included the [[2001 UEFA Champions League Final|2001 final]] against Valencia and the 2012 semi-final against Real Madrid. [[Didier Drogba]] dispatched the winning penalty, having been unable to take the fifth kick (missed by Terry) in the 2008 final due to a red card in extra time. The following day, many British newspapers made reference to the fact that an English team had finally beaten a German team on penalties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/may/20/chelsea-national-newspapers|title=How the papers reported Chelsea's football victory|first=Roy|last=Greenslade|date=20 May 2012|website=The Guardian|access-date=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510223748/https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/may/20/chelsea-national-newspapers|archive-date=10 May 2017}}</ref>

On 26 May 2021, [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] defeated Manchester United 11–10 on penalties in the [[2021 UEFA Europa League Final]], after the game ended 1–1 after extra time. Every player on the pitch took penalties – Manchester United goalkeeper [[David De Gea]] was the only one to miss, with his shot being saved by [[Gerónimo Rulli]] to hand Villarreal its first major title. The 21 penalties converted was a record for a shoot-out in a major UEFA tournament match.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/57224112|title=David De Gea spot kick saved in epic Europa League Final|work=BBC Sport|date=26 May 2021|access-date=27 May 2021}}</ref>

In major international tournaments, the most penalties came in the [[2006 African Cup of Nations]], where Ivory Coast and Cameroon needed 24 penalties to decide who would advance to the semi-finals. The Ivory Coast advanced by winning 12–11 after [[Samuel Eto'o]] missed his second attempt, as his was the only miss of the penalty shootout.<ref name=PSO/><ref>[https://www.rsssf.org/tables/06a-det.html African Nations Cup 2006 Final Tournament – QUARTERFINALS: Cameroon vs Ivory Coast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022135603/http://www.rsssf.com/tables/06a-det.html |date=22 October 2008 }}.

On 11 December 2012, [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] set the record for most consecutive penalty shootout wins. They won 9 penalty shootouts since 2009 and that included wins against Arsenal and local rivals [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=12 December 2012|title=Bradford-City penalty shoot-out record following history making victory over Arsenal|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/league-two/9739506/Bradford-City-penalty-shoot-out-record-following-history-making-victory-over-Arsenal.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/league-two/9739506/Bradford-City-penalty-shoot-out-record-following-history-making-victory-over-Arsenal.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|access-date=2 November 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

The shortest possible penalty shootout consists of three kicks by each team, with one team scoring all its kicks and the other team failing to score any. An example of this occurred in the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup#Semi-finals|semi-final of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]], with Chile beating Portugal 3–0,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/28/portugal-chile-confederations-cup-semi-final-match-report|title = Claudio Bravo saves three penalties to send Chile to Confederations Cup final|website = [[TheGuardian.com]]|date = 28 June 2017}}</ref> or the UEFA Euro 2024 where Portugal beat Slovenia with the same result in the shootout.

==Statistical record==
A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it.<ref>Laws of the Game 2007/2008, p.130: "The kicks from the penalty mark are not part of the match"</ref><ref name="faq">{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/faq/ |title=FAQ: Coefficients (associations, clubs, access list) |access-date=23 June 2008 |date=1 July 2005 |publisher=[[UEFA]] |quote=Kicks from the penalty mark to determine which club qualifies or to determine the winners of a tie do not affect the actual result of the match. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527082427/http://www.uefa.com/uefa/faq/ |archive-date=27 May 2008 }}

</ref> In the case of a [[Two-legged match|two-legged fixture]], the two matches are still considered either as two draws or as one win and one loss; in the case of a single match, it is still considered as a draw. This contrasts with a fixture won in extra time, where the score at the end of normal time is superseded. Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for "[[Golden Boot (disambiguation)|golden boot]]"<!--intentional link to DAB page--> competitions.

The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] rules book, which governs most [[College soccer in the United States|college soccer]] in the United States, takes a similar approach. With the exception of the national championship game, if the score of any game remains tied following the [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death overtime (or golden goal)]], the game is recorded as a tie, regardless of the result of the shoot-out tiebreaker. In a national championship game, the result of the shoot-out tiebreaker also determines the result of the game for statistical purposes.<ref name="NCAA 2017 Rules">{{cite journal|last= Andres|first= Ken|title= 2016 and 2017 NCAA Men's and Women's Soccer Rules|journal= NCAA Men's and Women's Soccer Rules|date= June 2016|publisher= [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|The National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|location= [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]|issn= 0735-0368|page= 38|url= http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/SO17.pdf|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181003092456/http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/SO17.pdf|archive-date= 3 October 2018|url-status= live}}</ref> Until 2001, all NCAA games in which the shoot-out tiebreaker was used to determine advancement or a champion were recorded as a tie.<ref name="NCAA 2001 Rules">{{cite journal|last= McCrath|first= C.

==Criticisms==
As a way to decide a football match, shoot-outs have been seen variously as a thrilling climax or as an unsatisfactory cop-out.

Paul Doyle describes shoot-outs as "exciting and suspense-filled" and [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final shoot-out]] as "the perfect way to end a wonderful ... final".<ref name="doyle">{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Doyle |date=21 May 2008 |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=A match worthy of champions |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/05/21/the_teams_delivered_a_match_wo.html |access-date=29 June 2008 |location=London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527011957/http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/05/21/the_teams_delivered_a_match_wo.html |archive-date=27 May 2008 }}

===Advantage to team kicking first?===

During IFAB's 133rd Annual Business Meeting in [[Glasgow]], Scotland on 22 November 2018, it was agreed that due to the lack of strong support mainly because of its complexity, the ABBA option would no longer be used in future competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2018/m=11/news=ifab-s-133rd-annual-business-meeting-recommends-fine-tuning-laws-for-the-benefit.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122231032/https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2018/m=11/news=ifab-s-133rd-annual-business-meeting-recommends-fine-tuning-laws-for-the-benefit.html|archive-date=22 November 2018|title=IFAB's 133rd Annual Business Meeting recommends fine-tuning Laws for the benefit of the game|publisher=FIFA.com|date=22 November 2018}}</ref>

==Alternatives==
Other tie-break methods have been proposed, both before and since shoot-outs were introduced.

Association football used the [[Determining the Outcome of a Match (association football)#The "touch down"|"touch down"]] (similar to a try in rugby) between 1866 and 1867. The touch-down was related to similar tie-breakers used in non-association football codes, such as the "rouge" in the [[Eton field game]] (and, from 1862 to 1868, in [[Sheffield Rules#The rouge|Sheffield Rules]]). In rugby itself, the [[Try (rugby)|try]] served as a tie-breaker between 1875 and 1886.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/scoring.htm |title=Scoring through the ages |last=Trueman |first=Nigel |work=Rugby football history |access-date=10 October 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804112452/http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/scoring.htm |archive-date=4 August 2009 }}

A drawn result may be allowed to stand, unless the fixture determines which team qualifies for a later round. Before 1993 (except in [[1974 FA Charity Shield|1974]]) the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]] was shared if the match was drawn. When the [[Football at the 1972 Summer Olympics#Bronze Medal match|third place playoff of the 1972 Olympic tournament]] between the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviets]] and [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]] ended 2–2 after extra time,<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197110/matches/match=32161/report.html Olympic Football Tournament Munich 1972: Soviet Union – German Democratic Republic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104213935/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197110/matches/match=32161/report.html |date=4 November 2013 }} FIFA.com

During the [[1962 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification process]] for the [[1962 World Cup]], Morocco and Tunisia formed a two-team group. They both won 2–1 at home, so they played the third match at a neutral location. When this ended in a 1–1 draw after extra time, Morocco advanced on a coin toss to the next round of qualification. This scenario was repeated during the [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification process]] for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], when the same two teams were tied after three matches and extra time. Again, Morocco advanced on a coin toss. Tunisia did have better luck with the coin toss in the intervening years; during the [[1965 African Cup of Nations]], they reached the final at the expense of Senegal by winning a coin toss after three group matches had left Tunisia and Senegal tied with a win (over Ethiopia) and a draw (against each other).

Alternatives include replaying a match that has ended in a draw. In the [[1974 European Cup Final|1974 European Cup final]], the final score of the first match was a draw, leading to a replay being played two days later. This remains the only time it has happened in [[UEFA Champions League|the competition]]. Replays still occur up to, and including, the fifth round (last 16) of the [[FA Cup|English FA Cup]]. Until 1991, any number of replays were permitted, with a record of five.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/05/48711.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20040106155319/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/05/48711.htm |archive-date=6 January 2004 |title=FA Cup Trivia |date=16 May 2003 |access-date=15 June 2008 |publisher=[[The Football Association|FA]]}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=May 2018}} (Since then, a draw in the [first] replay has been resolved by a penalty-shoot-out.) However, it was announced in April 2024 that replays would be scrapped from the first round onwards beginning with the [[2024–25 FA Cup|2024-2025 FA Cup season]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=FA Cup replays scrapped from first round onwards |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/68844583 |access-date=2024-04-25 |work=BBC Sport |language=en-GB}}</ref> 

Other suggestions have included using elements of match play such as most shots on goal, most [[corner kick]]s awarded, fewest [[Misconduct (association football)|cautions and sendings-off]], or having ongoing [[extra time]] with teams compelled to remove players at progressive intervals (similar to regular season play in the [[National Hockey League]], where players play 3-on-3 in the extra time).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.penaltyshootouts.co.uk/alternatives.html |title=Penalty Shoot-outs: alternatives |first1=Jon |last1=Billsberry |first2=Nathalie |last2 = van Meurs |first3=Patrick | last3 = Nelson |first4=Gareth | last4 = Edwards |access-date=20 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624181210/http://www.penaltyshootouts.co.uk/alternatives.html |archive-date=24 June 2008 }}</ref> These proposals have not yet been authorised by the [[International Football Association Board]]. However, after the 2006 World Cup, [[Sepp Blatter]] stated that he wants no more penalty shoot-outs in the Final of the World Cup, tentatively suggesting either a replay or "Maybe to take players away and play [[golden goal]]".<ref name="blatter" />

Henry Birtles' "Advantage" proposal is for the shoot-out to be held before extra-time, and only acting as a tiebreak if the game remains a draw after the full 120 minutes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/33743/FIFA-ponder-end-to-shoot-out-woe |title=FIFA ponder end to shoot-out woe |work=[[Daily Express]] |date=4 February 2008 |access-date=20 June 2008 |first=Bill |last=Bradshaw }}
</ref> Proponents of this idea state that it would lead to a more offensive extra-time as one of the teams would know they have to score and there would never be a match in which both teams are simply waiting for penalties. Another advantage is that players who have missed would have a chance to redeem themselves in extra-time. The obvious flaw is that the team that wins the penalty shoot-out would be inclined to play defensively in extra time in the knowledge that a draw would put them through. However, this flaw is not so clear because a single goal makes the difference between winning and losing, as opposed to a team that defends a single-goal lead more comfortably because a conceded goal is the difference between winning and drawing.

Another alternative is Attacker Defender Goalkeeper (ADG), which features a series of ten contests, in which an attacker kicks off from 32 yards and has 15 seconds to score a goal against a defender and goalkeeper. At the completion of the ten contests, the team with the most goals is the winner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theadgalternative.com/ |title=Theadgalternative.com |publisher=Theadgalternative.com |date=5 August 2010 |access-date=19 May 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110224090150/http://www.theadgalternative.com/ |archive-date=24 February 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bleacherreport.com/articles/1195909-10-alternatives-to-a-penalty-shootout |title=10 Alternatives to Penalty Shootouts |last=Tidey |first=Will |work=Bleacher Report |access-date=3 November 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103150137/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1195909-10-alternatives-to-a-penalty-shootout |archive-date=3 November 2012 }}

==North American experiments==
The [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL) in the 1970s and 1980s, then [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) for its first four seasons (1996–1999) experimented with a variation of the shoot-out procedure.

Instead of a straight penalty kick, the shoot-out started {{convert|35|yd|m|abbr=out|disp=or}} from the goal and having five seconds to attempt a shot. The player could make as many moves as he could in a breakaway situation in the five seconds, then attempt a shot. This procedure is similar to that used in an [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|ice hockey penalty shot]]. As with a standard shoot-out, this variation used a best-of-five-kicks model, and if the score was still level, the tiebreaker would head to an extra round of one attempt per team.

This format rewarded player skills, as players were able to attempt to deceive goalkeepers and play the ball in an attempt to make the shot, as in a one-on-one skills contest, and goalkeepers could take on the attackers without restrictions that are normally implemented in penalty shootouts. [[Soccer Bowl '81]], the NASL's 1981 championship final, was decided by this format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyG1cBb-cpM|title=NASL Soccer Bowl '81|last=thecelebratedmisterk|date=13 April 2010|access-date=3 May 2018|via=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531020714/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyG1cBb-cpM|archive-date=31 May 2016}}</ref>

From its inception in [[1968 North American Soccer League season|1968]], the NASL used an unconventional point system in determining the league standings. Teams were awarded six points for a win and three points for a draw. In addition, teams earned one bonus point for each goal scored in a game up to a maximum of three per game. Thus, a team that lost 5–3 would earn three points. However, a team that lost 1–0 would earn no points. Also, a team that won 5–4 would earn nine points (the same as a 3–0 win). But a team that won 2–0 would earn only eight points. In the league's second season ([[1969 North American Soccer League season|1969]]), the [[Kansas City Spurs]] were the league champions with 10 wins, 2 losses and 4 ties even though the [[Atlanta Chiefs]] had 11 wins, 2 losses and 3 ties, because Kansas City earned more bonus points. Starting with [[1971 North American Soccer League season|1971]] postseason playoff matches, the NASL used a [[golden goal]] rule, and every match had a winner decided from the run of play. Extra-time sessions were 15 minutes long before a brief break and change of ends. Game 1 of the 1971 NASL semifinal series between the [[Rochester Lancers (1967–80)|Rochester Lancers]] and the [[Dallas Tornado]] went six extra-time periods with Rochester scoring the game-winning goal in the 176th minute. Game 3 of that same series went four extra time periods with Dallas scoring in the 148th minute to win the match and the series. In [[1975 North American Soccer League season|1975]], the NASL adopted a conventional penalty-kick shootout system for all regular-season and postseason playoff matches, and there were no longer any NASL matches that ended in ties. In the standings, a team that won in regulation time was awarded six points. A team that won in a penalty-kick shootout was awarded one point. Bonus points continued to be awarded for each goal scored up to a maximum of three per game. In [[1977 North American Soccer League season|1977]], the NASL adopted the experimental North American shootout procedure described above. If a match was tied after 90 minutes, a maximum of two golden goal extra time periods of 7.5 minutes each were played. If neither team scored, the shootout was held to determine the winner of the match. In the standings, a team that won was awarded six points whether the win came in regulation time, extra time or by shootout. Bonus points continued to be awarded for each goal scored up to a maximum of three per game. No bonus points were awarded for goals scored in extra time. Postseason playoff games were decided in the same manner. In [[1981 North American Soccer League season|1981]], the number of points awarded to a team that won a game in a shootout was reduced from six to four. This remained the system until the NASL's final season in [[1984 North American Soccer League season|1984]].

From its inception in [[1996 Major League Soccer season|1996]], MLS used the shootout system that had been used by the NASL to determine winners of matches. No regular-season or postseason playoff games ended in a tie. In general, no extra time was played; the shootout commenced immediately after 90 minutes had been played. The only exception was in the [[MLS Cup '96|MLS Cup Final]] in which a match tied after 90 minutes would be followed by a maximum of two 15-minute extra time sessions on a golden goal basis. In the regular-season standings, a team that won a match in regulation was awarded three points. A team that won a match in a shootout was awarded one point. There were no bonus points or points awarded to teams that lost whether in regulation time or a shootout. In the playoffs, the conference semifinals and conference finals were organised as best-of-three matches series. A shootout win counted as a win. Thus, a team could win two of the three matches by shootout and lose the other match in regulation and still advance to the next round. This was inconsistent with how the teams were rewarded during the regular season when the team with one win would have earned three points, and the team with two wins would have earned only two points. In [[1999 Major League Soccer season|1999]], a maximum of two 15-minute golden goal extra time periods were added for matches that were tied after 90 minutes of regulation play. If neither team scored during extra time, the match was decided by a shootout. MLS abandoned the North American style shootout starting with the [[2000 Major League Soccer season|2000 season]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Alex|last=Yannis|date=18 November 1999|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=M.L.S. is Making Changes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/18/sports/soccer-mls-is-making-changes.html|access-date=13 July 2014|location=New York|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714180417/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/18/sports/soccer-mls-is-making-changes.html|archive-date=14 July 2014}}</ref> If penalties are required to determine a winner during the playoffs, MLS now uses the shoot-out procedure specified by the International Football Association Board.

In the [[MLS Next Pro]] development league, all draws are followed by a penalty shoot out. While both teams receive 1 match point for the draw, the team winning the penalty shootout gets an additional match point, resulting in draws giving 1 point to the loser of the shootout and 2 to the winner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/major-league-soccer/story/4622788/mls-next-pro-no-drawsjust-penalty-shootouts-in-inaugural-season|access-date=2022-12-07|date=2022-03-21|title=MLS Next Pro: No draws, just penalty shootouts in inaugural season|last=Bonagura|first=Kyle|work=ESPN}}</ref>
