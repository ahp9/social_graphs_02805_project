The three had been recruited in relatively young ages as Tekin and Gültiken joined the squad as youth players.<ref name=hurriyet1>{{cite news| title = Yeni yıldızlar gelecek | url = http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/ShowNew.aspx?id=9074617 | newspaper= [[Hürriyet]] | author= Er, İsmail| date = 2 June 2008| access-date = 19 August 2012|language=tr}}</ref> Tekin and Uçar were promoted to the professional team during the 1982–83 season. They were joined by Gültiken in the beginning of 1984–85 season. Tekin and Gültiken played together during the pre-season [[TSYD Cup]] for the first time. In the opening match of the season, all three footballers played for some minutes; however, they were not on the pitch at the same time. On 23 March 1984, the trio played together for the very first time after Tekin was joined by Uçar in the 67th minute and Gültiken in the 79th minute. On 5 January 1986, the three were in the starting squad for the first time. Beşiktaş managed to beat [[Trabzonspor]] with Metin Tekin's goal in that match. Later that season, the trio became permanent players in the starting eleven of the team.

The trio had achieved numerous glories, and various notable scores in domestic competitions. They contributed the only three-in-a-row title achieving term of club history in 1989–90, 1990–91 and 1991–92 seasons. Most notably, Beşiktaş became the first and to this day only undefeated champion in Turkish League history.<ref>{{cite news| title = 1991–92 League Ranking| url = https://www.angelfire.com/nj/sivritepe/artl9192.html| publisher = [[Angelfire]]| access-date = 2011-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title = 1991–92 League Ranking| url = http://www.tff.org.tr/Default.aspx?pageID=561| publisher = tff.org.tr | access-date = 2011-09-04|language=tr}}</ref>

The three had taken a part in the squad of historical match against [[Adana Demirspor]], ended [[Beşiktaş JK 10–0 Adana Demirspor|10–0]] in favour of Beşiktaş, as the highest margin ever scored in Turkish First League history, on 15 October 1989.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sporx.com/futbol/superlig/en-farkli-galibiyet-besiktasinSXHBQ122375SXQ | title=En farklı galibiyet Beşiktaş'ın | publisher= sporx.com | language=tr | access-date= 2011-09-04}}</ref> They scored all the goals, in which Gültiken put 4, Tekin and Uçar put 3 goals away.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bjk.com.tr/tr/haberler.php?h_no=3356&xl=tarihce&k_id=0 | title= 15.10.1989 BEŞİKTAŞ – ADANA DEMİRSPOR : 10–0 | publisher= bjk.com.tr| language=tr | date=2000-01-11 | access-date=2011-09-04}}</ref> Started on Week 26 of 1990–91 season, the unbeaten record of the team lasted for 48 straight matches, until Week 13 of 1992–93 season.<ref name=hurriyet2>{{cite news| title = Seni Çok Özlemiştik | url = http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/ShowNew.aspx?id=-94777 | newspaper= [[Hürriyet]] | date = 6 August 1999| access-date = 19 August 2012|language=tr}}</ref><ref name=hurriyet3>{{cite news| title = Ligin Rekorları ve İlkleri | url = http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/ShowNew.aspx?id=12209113 | newspaper= [[Hürriyet]] | date = 19 August 2008| access-date = 19 August 2012|language=tr}}</ref>

The last competitive match where Metin, Ali, and Feyyaz played together was the league match against [[Zeytinburnuspor]] on 6 March 1994. In that match, Ali Gültiken came as a substitute in the 60th minute. The trio disbanded when Feyyaz Uçar was transferred to [[Fenerbahçe SK]] at the end of 1993–94 season.

During a post-retirement interview, Tekin expressed that he was first a [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]] supporter in his childhood, influenced by his father, however; he later changed his preference for Beşiktaş.<ref name=hurriyet4>{{cite news| title = Rıza, Feyyaz ve ben G.Saraylı’ydık | url = http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/ShowNew.aspx?id=3876076 | newspaper= [[Hürriyet]] | date = 2 February 2006 | access-date = 19 August 2012|language=tr}}</ref>
