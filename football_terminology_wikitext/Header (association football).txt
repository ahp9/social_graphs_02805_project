A '''header''' is a technique that is used in [[association football]] to control the ball using the head to pass, shoot, or clear. This can be done from a standing, jumping, or diving position.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.soccerperformance.org/training/heading.htm|title = TECHNIQUE – HEADING|access-date = 14 February 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160216035114/http://www.soccerperformance.org/training/heading.htm|archive-date = 16 February 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref> Heading is a common technique and is used by players in practically every match. Although a useful technique in football, heading carries significant health risks, particularly to the brain, and governing bodies have taken measures to address these risks.

== Usage ==
In general, a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] uses a header to score a goal, while a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] mostly uses a header to prevent the scoring of a goal by the opponent. When the ball is in the air, a header is often the best option because a player cannot make contact with the ball using their hands. Most header goals are scored as a result of a [[Cross (football)|cross]] or a [[Corner kick|corner]]. In these situations, one attacking player passes the ball across the goal in the air, and another player (either standing, jumping or diving) strikes the ball towards the goal with their head.<ref>{{cite web|title=Attacking Header|url=https://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/football_skills_attacking_header.html|work=Talkfootball|access-date=14 February 2016}}</ref>

During a football match, a player might head the ball six to twelve times, on average.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Rodrigues |first1=Ana Carolina |last2=Lasmar |first2=Rodrigo Pace |last3=Caramelli |first3=Paulo |date=2016-03-21 |title=Effects of Soccer Heading on Brain Structure and Function |journal=Frontiers in Neurology |volume=7 |pages=38 |doi=10.3389/fneur.2016.00038 |issn=1664-2295 |pmc=4800441 |pmid=27047444|doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Health concerns==

=== Risks ===
[[File:Gomis and Neustädter in a header duel (October 2017) - Pic2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bafétimbi Gomis]] (left) and [[Roman Neustädter]] (right) nearly butt heads while competing for a header during [[The Intercontinental Derby (football)|The Intercontinental Derby]] in 2017.]]
Heading the ball, whether in practice or a competitive match, carries health risks that can become apparent immediately or after a few years. Additionally, injury can occur from just one instance of heading the ball or an accumulation of repetitive headers.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

The most common injury associated with heading is [[Concussion|concussions]], which account for 22% of all football injuries. Subconcussive injuries are also a concern when heading the ball. While symptoms for subconcussive injuries are not as apparent as a concussion, damage is still being dealt to the brain. In some cases, subconcussive injuries can be more severe than concussions in the long run.

A 2019 study shows that footballers, with the exclusion of goal keepers, are three and a half times more likely to suffer from neurodegenerative disease than the general population. In 2021, research had been published that shows defenders are at greater risk of developing dementia.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Smith |first=Rory |date=2022-07-22 |title=Does Soccer Still Need the Header? |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/22/sports/soccer/soccer-headers.html |access-date=2023-02-16 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

=== Incidents ===
[[Jeff Astle]], a former English professional football player, was ruled to have died from an [[Industrial Disease|industrial disease]] which was linked to heading of footballs. Former Wales professional football player, [[Alan Jarvis]], was ruled to have died in a similar fashion.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bull |first=Andy |date=2021-03-11 |title=Football grapples slowly with brain injury, 19 years on from Jeff Astle's death |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/mar/11/football-grapples-slowly-with-brain-injury-19-years-on-from-jeff-astle |access-date=2023-02-16 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

=== Responses ===

==== England ====
In 2020, the [[The Football Association|Football Association]] (FA) provided guidance that advised coaches against practicing headers in practice for children aged 11 and under. They also advised coaches to introduce light heading practice for children playing in U-12 to U-16. They even made recommendations for professional football, advising only 10 high-force headers in practice per week.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Media |first=P. A. |date=2022-07-18 |title=FA to trial banning deliberate heading by children under 12 in England |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/18/fa-to-trial-banning-deliberate-heading-by-children-under-12-in-england |access-date=2023-02-16 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In July 2022, the FA announced they received approval from the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB) to trial the removal of deliberate heading in matches for those playing U-12 and under. The trial will run for the 2022–23 season and will be coordinated with the [[County football association|County FA]] network, leagues, clubs, and schools. If successful, the FA will then apply to IFAB for a law change. If approved, deliberate heading will be banned in matches at the U-12 level and below starting in the 2023–24 season.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 18, 2022 |title=The FA to trial the removal of heading in U12 matches and below in 2022–23 season |url=https://www.thefa.com/news/2022/jul/18/statement-heading-trial-u12-games-20221807 |access-date=February 15, 2023 |website=The FA}}</ref>

==== United States ====
In 2016, the [[United States Soccer Foundation]] implemented measures to mitigate the risks of heading the ball. The first is that children aged 10 and under cannot head the ball in practice or in games. The second limits heading for children aged 12 and 13. They are allowed to practice heading for only 30 minutes a week, and the total number of headers per player, per week cannot exceed 20. There are no restrictions on heading in a game for children aged 12 and 13.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Head Injuries |url=https://usclubsoccer.org/headinjuries/ |access-date=2023-02-15 |website=US Club Soccer Website |language=en-US}}</ref>

In addition to the restrictions above, the US Soccer Federation has also updated their rules for matches. Under the new rules, if a player aged 10 and under deliberately heads a ball in a match, an [[Free kick (association football)|indirect free kick]] is awarded to the opposing team. Additionally, if a player is substituted from a match due to a suspected head injury, that substitution does not count towards the team's total number of allowed substitutions.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Guidroz |first=John |date=2016-04-21 |title=New US Soccer Heading Laws and Playing Rules {{!}} Who They Affect? |url=https://snapsoccer.com/news/new-u-s-soccer-heading-laws-affect/ |access-date=2023-02-15 |website=Snap Soccer |language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Risk mitigation ====
Although the risks of heading a football cannot be eliminated, recommendations have been made to mitigate those risks. The first is to learn the proper technique. There are ways to strike a football with the head that decreases harmful impact, such as stabilizing the neck. One can also wear headgear to reduce impact.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}} Additionally, strengthening neck muscles can help reduce the risk of harm.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Heading the Ball in Soccer: Is It Safe? {{!}} Orthopedic Blog |url=https://www.orthocarolina.com/orthopedic-news/heading-the-ball-in-soccer-is-it-safe |access-date=2023-02-16 |website=OrthoCarolina |language=en}}</ref>

Another recommendation is to change the properties of the football being used. Studies have shown that a ball with lower air pressure and lower mass reduce acceleration and impact to the brain. While this may not be a feasible option for competitive matches, experts suggest implementing these changes to balls being used during practice.<ref name=":1" />
