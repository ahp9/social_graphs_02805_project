{{Short description|British football pejorative term}}
"'''Mickey Mouse cup'''" is a [[pejorative]] term used particularly in [[Football in the United Kingdom|British football]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Collins |first=Roy |title=Home and away: a tale of the divide between rich and poor |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2000-03-20 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/mar/20/newsstory.sport4 |accessdate=2008-11-08 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=Voyeur>{{cite news |title=Wenger breakaway threat |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=2003-01-05 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2393826/Wenger-breakaway-threat.html |accessdate=2008-11-08 | location=London}}</ref> to describe some [[single elimination tournament|knockout competitions]] regarded as having lesser prestige than others, for example the [[English Football League Cup]], compared with the [[FA Cup]].  Despite its status as [[List of world champion football clubs|worldwide competition]] organised by the sport's governing body, [[FIFA]], the term has also been applied to the [[FIFA Club World Cup]], a competition won by an English club four times since its debut in [[2000 FIFA Club World Championship|2000]].<ref name=Voyeur/><ref>{{cite news |title=Edwards derides 'no win' situation |publisher=BBC |date=1999-06-28 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/379410.stm |access-date=2008-11-10}}</ref>

Often, a club that perceives a competition as a "[[Mickey Mouse]] Cup" &ndash; usually a [[Premier League]] side &ndash; will field a weakened, reserve or youth team in the competition, resting more high-profile players and further weakening the perception of the competition.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reade |first=Brian |title=Sorry Kev should just walk away ...While he can cling to his sanity |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |date=2004-10-30 |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/columnists/reade/2004/10/30/sorry-kev-should-just-walk-away-while-he-can-cling-to-his-sanity-115875-14814063/ |accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref> However, this often has the effect of giving chances to play to developing players, who may progress into the first team.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reade |first=Brian |title=Big two should stop their mind games and start worrying about Chelsea |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |date=2004-11-13 |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/columnists/reade/2004/11/13/big-two-should-stop-their-mind-games-and-start-worrying-about-chelsea-115875-14867502/ |accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref>

The term may also be applied to a competition to intentionally disparage the winning of it by a rival side, or to minimise the importance of the competition to a club if knocked out. This may be done as part of a [[mind games|mind game]] with rival clubs in other competitions, or for reasons to maintain team morale.<ref name=Shine>{{cite news |last=Tyldesley |first=Clive |title=League Cup takes its chance to shine |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=2003-02-28 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2397106/League-Cup-takes-its-chance-to-shine.html |accessdate=2008-11-08 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Maddock |first=David |title=Fading Alex Cup |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |date=2006-02-20 |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2006/02/20/fading-alex-cup-115875-16723973/ |accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref>

The [[English Football League Cup]] is often referred to as the "Mickey Mouse Cup" by supporters of larger Premier League clubs <ref name=LeagueCup>{{cite news |last=Dale |first=Michael |title=League Cup: Blackburn vs. Everton Preview |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |date=2008-09-24 |url=http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/premier-league-fans/2008/09/blackburn-vs-everton-preview.html#more |accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref> as is the [[EFL Trophy]] which has been known by various sponsors' names and which was previously the Associate Members Cup.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Buckingham |first=Philip |date=2020-08-04 |title=Allams' plan, difficulty selling, transfers: Hull City transcript |url=https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/hull-city-owners-allam-transcript-4392777 |access-date=2023-01-19 |website=HullLive |language=en}}</ref> The perception of a cup as "Mickey Mouse" may not be universal, since smaller and lower standard competitions give a chance for lower league clubs to win silverware, and additionally gain extra revenue from playing a much larger club.<ref name=LeagueCup/> Also for some of the top league clubs, reaching and winning the final at [[Wembley Stadium]] has some prestige. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/20/klopp-shows-regard-for-carabao-cup-with-strong-side-and-wild-celebrations|title=Up for the cups: Jürgen Klopp ends Liverpool's wait for Wembley final &#124; Andy Hunter|website=[[TheGuardian.com]]|date=20 January 2022}}</ref>

Since the rebranding of [[UEFA competitions|UEFA club competitions]] in late 1990s, the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] is considered by a group of mass media, personnel related to football and fans as a "minor trophy" or "Mickey Mouse cup" due to being mediaticly overshadowed by the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].<ref>{{Cite news|first=Toby|last=Moses|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/mar/12/europa-league-emerge-champions-league-shadows|title=Europa League is finally emerging from the Champions League's shadow|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 March 2015|quote=Europe's second-string competition has suffered from a diminished reputation in England ever since the UEFA Cup was merged with the Cup Winners' Cup back in 1999. [...] While the Champions League is the sole preserve of the rich and powerful, the Europa League offers a chance to everyone else, those locked out of Europe's top table by the oligarchs and well-established dynasties.}}</ref> Originally the Champions League (formerly European Cup) was only open to the domestic league winners, while the UEFA Cup featured the domestic league runners-ups and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup was for the winners of the top domestic cup competition. However the expansion of the Champions League to include up to the top four finishers in the strongest European domestic leagues has reduced the prestige of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup (which was abolished and folded into the UEFA Cup) and the resulting expanded UEFA Cup. Consequently achieving a top three or four domestic league finish (which guarantees Champions League participation) became much more important than winning a domestic cup (which only guarantees entry to the Europa League or Conference League).<ref name=UEL>{{cite news|language=es|first=Guillermo|last=Sánchez Vega|url=https://cincodias.elpais.com/cincodias/2008/09/27/empresas/1222522793_850215.amp.html|title=La Copa de la UEFA cambia para frenar el declive y generar negocio|work=[[Cinco Días]]|publisher=[[PRISA]]|date=27 September 2008|quote=es: El año pasado [2007], los 40 equipos que comenzaron la competición se repartieron 40,3 millones de euros, una cifra irrisoria si se compara con los al menos 588,6 millones para los 32 clubes participantes en la Champions, según datos de la UEFA.

The [[UEFA Europa Conference League|Conference League]], created in 2021 as a [[demerge]] of the Europa League (the UEFA Cup's commercial name since it was [[rebranding|rebranded]] to resolve its sporting and economic crisis in 2008),<ref name=UEL/> has also been described as a "Mickey Mouse cup" by that group.

Champions League participation, and achieving a top three or four domestic league finish (which guarantees Champions League participation), has become much more important than winning a domestic cup (which only guarantees entry to the UEFA Cup) like the [[FA Cup]] or [[English Football League Cup]]. For instance the [[2011–12 Copa del Rey]] had its [[2012 Copa del Rey Final|final]] scheduled unusually late by the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]], so that it would allow the big clubs such as [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] to focus on the Champions League. Another example was when [[Manchester United]] controversially withdrew from the [[1999–2000 FA Cup]],<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/united-underline-cup-withdrawal-742549.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220514/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/united-underline-cup-withdrawal-742549.html |archive-date=2022-05-14 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=United underline Cup withdrawal |work=Independent |last=Staniforth |first=Tommy |date=29 October 1999 |accessdate=16 May 2011 |location=London }}</ref> the first time the holders had done so, which combined with the UEFA Cup's decline (see above) has reduced the importance of the FA Cup and other domestic cups. United had earlier entered into the inaugural [[FIFA Club World Cup|Club World Championship]], supposedly to help England with its [[FIFA World Cup hosts#2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup host bid]], under pressure from the government and The FA. United stated that entering both the FA Cup and Club World Cup would overload their fixture schedule that would make it more difficult to defend their Champions League and Premiership titles, and claimed that they did not want to devalue the FA Cup by fielding a weaker side. The move benefited United as they received a two-week break and ended up winning the 1999–2000 league title by an 18-point margin, although they did not progress past the group stages of the Club World Cup. The withdrawal from the FA Cup, however, drew considerable criticism as this weakened the tournament's prestige and manager [[Alex Ferguson]] has since admitted his regrets in how they handled the situation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/6713077/Sir-Alex-Ferguson-Manchester-Uniteds-1999-FA-Cup-withdrawal-was-a-mistake.html|publisher=[[Telegraph.co.uk]] |title=Sir Alex Ferguson: Manchester United's 1999 FA Cup withdrawal was a mistake |date=3 December 2009 |accessdate=16 May 2011 |location=London}}</ref> While winning three FA Cups in the 1990s, as part of the "[[Double (association football)|Doubles]]" in 1994 and 1996 and the 1999 "Treble", switching focus to the Premier League and UEFA Champions League meant that United has only won the FA Cup in 2004,2016 and 2024. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1642897-manchester-uniteds-5-biggest-flaws-this-season#/articles/1642897-manchester-uniteds-5-biggest-flaws-this-season/page/6|title = Manchester United's 5 Biggest Flaws This Season|website = [[Bleacher Report]]}}</ref> 

The terms ''Mickey Mouse Treble'' and ''Mickey Mouse Double'' have been used subjectively to disparage the winning of what are perceived as multiple lesser trophies by larger clubs in a single season, in comparison to a [[Treble (association football)|continental treble]] and a [[Double (association football)|double]]. Such terms are usually applied by a rival club.

=== English football ===
One example of a tournament often labeled as a "Mickey Mouse cup" in English football is the '''[[Full Members' Cup]]''', which was held between 1985 and 1992. Introduced after English clubs were banned from European competitions following the Heysel disaster, the competition was intended for teams in the top two divisions of the Football League. However, many clubs, particularly those in the First Division, chose not to participate or fielded weakened teams, leading to the perception that the tournament was of lower prestige. Despite its lack of status compared to domestic league and cup competitions, it was still won by some notable clubs such as Chelsea and  Nottingham Forest. The use of the term "Mickey Mouse cup" in reference to the Full Members' Cup highlights how football fans and pundits often dismiss certain competitions when they lack widespread support, high financial incentives, or strong participation from leading clubs.

===Other football competitions===
Since 2010, the term has been used as a nickname for the [[Walt Disney World Pro Soccer Classic]], a preseason tournament played by teams in the [[Major League Soccer]], a league that itself has been called a "Mickey Mouse League".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wakingthered.com/2013/2/22/4018924/torsten-frings-to-say-farewell|title = Torsten Frings to Say Farewell to Toronto FC?|date = 22 February 2013}}</ref>

In recent years the term has also become popular amongst [[Australian Football League]] fans when referring to the fruitless and seldom taken seriously [[NAB Cup]].

==Other users==
The term has also been used to undermine football referees. After a questionable decision by an official in a [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] match, manager [[Joe Kinnear]] reacted by criticising the quality of refereeing, saying: "It was a blatant foul, a blatant push prior to the penalty, and he ignores it...it was just a Mickey Mouse ref doing nothing."<ref>{{cite news |last=Fifield |first=Dominic |title=Kinnear rant at referee trashes respect agenda |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2008-11-10 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/nov/10/premierleague-fulham |accessdate=2008-11-10 | location=London}}</ref>

The [[Los Angeles Lakers]]' victory in the [[2020 NBA Finals]] has been described as a "Mickey Mouse ring" for its unusual circumstances, chiefly the fact that the entire [[2020 NBA Playoffs]] took place in the [[2020 NBA Bubble|NBA Bubble]] in [[Walt Disney World]] due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].{{cn|date=January 2024}} Similarly, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] also had their [[2020 World Series]] championship called a "Mickey Mouse ring" since the season was shortened to 60 games, whose playoffs also occurred under a bubble format across multiple neutral sites.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/fannation/mlb/fastball/news/san-francisco-giants-troll-los-angeles-dodgers-by-scheduling-mickey-mouse-ear-giveaway-in-june|title=San Francisco Giants Set to Give Away Mickey Mouse Ears When Los Angeles Dodgers Visit in June|last=Connon|first=Sam|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date = 18 January 2024}}</ref> Another circumstance in the NBA has been described with the [[Boston Celtics]]' victory in the [[2024 NBA Finals]] and playoff run.
