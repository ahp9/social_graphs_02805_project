In [[association football]], '''work rate''' refers to the extent to which a [[Soccer player|player]] contributes to running and chasing in a [[Game|match]] while not in possession of the ball.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://oed.com/view/Entry/230216?redirectedFrom=work%20rate|title=Definition for work rate, n.|date=30 March 2011|accessdate=15 June 2011|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary Online]]}}</ref>

Work rate is generally indicated by the distance covered by a player during a match. An example of a player with a high work rate is [[Xavi (footballer, born 1980)|Xavi]], a former midfielder for [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. During the final of the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League]], Xavi ran almost 12&nbsp;km, more than any other player in the game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thefootballtacticsblog/2011/05/barcelona_provide_a_coachs_dre.html|title=Barcelona provide a coach's dream|date=30 May 2011|accessdate=15 June 2011|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref> The same is true of the final of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], when he covered a distance of 14.98&nbsp;km (including extra time).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/01/27/28/20/64_0711_ned-esp_playersheatmap.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111201757/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/01/27/28/20/64_0711_ned-esp_playersheatmap.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 11, 2012|title=2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa Players Heat Map|date=11 July 2010|accessdate=15 June 2011|publisher=[[FIFA.com]]}}</ref>

A high work rate is valued because players with this characteristic will be able to play a more active role in [[Defense (sports)|defending]] and [[Offense (sports)|attacking]] throughout a match. Conversely, players are sometimes criticized for low work rate; for instance, [[ESPN Soccernet]] correspondent Sam Limbert highlighted a poor work rate as one of the weaker qualities of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] midfielder [[Denílson Pereira Neves]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.soccernet.com/arsenal/archives/2011/05/time_to_renew_the_faith_1.php|title=Arsenal: Time to renew the faith|date=29 May 2011|accessdate=15 June 2011|publisher=[[ESPN Soccernet]]}}</ref>

However, some experts, such as former [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]] youth coach Carlos de Lorenzi, warn against the danger of equating high work rate with high talent. De Lorenzi had responsibility for the early development of such players as Brazilian star [[Kaká]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/04/world-cup-2010-best-players|title=World Cup 2010: Seven of the best players going to South Africa|date=4 June 2010|accessdate=15 June 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/front-page/brazils-world-cup-countdown/#|title=Brazil's World Cup countdown|date=8 June 2010|accessdate=15 June 2011|publisher=The Rio Times}}</ref>
