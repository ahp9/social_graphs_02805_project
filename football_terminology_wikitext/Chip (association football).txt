{{short description|Association football shot involving launching the ball via kicking from underneath}}
A '''chip''', also known as a '''lob''', is a shot in which the ball is kicked from underneath with accuracy but with less than maximum force, to launch it high into the air in order either to pass it over the heads of opponents or to score a [[Scoring in association football|goal]] over the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. Chip shots usually have backspin, otherwise they are usually considered a lob.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chip%20shot|title=Chip shot|work= Merriam-Webster|accessdate=11 February 2016}}</ref> 

In general, the lob requires that the player strike the ball with the front of their foot, using the toe to lift the ball up in the air.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=How to Chip a Soccer Ball|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Chip-a-Soccer-Ball|accessdate=11 February 2016|work=WikiHow}}</ref> Mostly used to score, it focuses on getting the ball to a certain amount of vertical height, where the goalkeeper can't reach it and then have it come back down again into the goal. It takes a certain amount of technique and precision to do and players such as [[Carlos Vela]], [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl González]], [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Radamel Falcao]], [[Ronaldinho]], [[Roberto Baggio]], [[Romário]], [[Francesco Totti]], [[Alessandro Del Piero]] and [[Lionel Messi]] have made it trademark moves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccer-training-guide.com/soccer-shooting.html |title=The Soccer Shooting Guide |publisher=Soccer-training-guide.com |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329000742/http://www.soccer-training-guide.com/soccer-shooting.html |archive-date=29 March 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/international-football/2017/02/22/58adac0ae5fdea9b038b45d2.html|title=The art of the chip: Falcao matches Totti, Messi and Raul|publisher=Marca|author1=Joel del Río|date=22 February 2017|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/48791/baggio%E2%80%99s-month-may|title=Baggio's month of May|publisher=Football Italia|author1=Dave Taylor|date=5 May 2014|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/150issue/delpieroicon.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104150909/http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/150issue/delpieroicon.html|archivedate=4 January 2009|title=Calcio Italia 150 issue, Calcio Icons, Del Piero|publisher=Channel4.com|last=Gilbert|first=Dan|date=22 July 2009|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref>

When a chip shot is used by a player when taking a penalty kick, it is called a ''[[Panenka (penalty kick)|panenka]]'', after Czech footballer [[Antonín Panenka]], who famously scored the winning penalty in the shootout of the [[1976 UEFA European Championship]] final in this manner, when he beat [[Germany national football team|West German]] goalkeeper [[Sepp Maier]] to claim the title for the [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia national team]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/31/theknowledge.sport|title=The footballers who have moves named after them|work=The Guardian|date=31 October 2007|access-date=14 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002152402/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/31/theknowledge.sport|archive-date=2 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[rabona]] can also be considered a chip if it has the same arc and backspin that the chip does.
