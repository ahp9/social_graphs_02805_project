'''Total Football''' ({{langx|nl|totaalvoetbal}}) is a tactical system in [[association football]] in which any [[Outfield#Association football|outfield]] player can take over the role of any other player in a team. A player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team, thus retaining the team's intended organisational structure. In this fluid system, no outfield player is fixed in a predetermined role; anyone can successively play as an [[Forward (association football)|attacker]], a [[midfielder]] and a [[Defender (association football)|defender]]. The only player who must stay in a specified position is the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]].

Total Football's tactical success depends largely on the adaptability of each footballer within the team, in particular the ability to quickly switch positions depending on the on-field situation. The theory requires players to be comfortable in multiple positions; hence, it requires intelligent players with many skills.

Manager [[Rinus Michels]] is generally credited with introducing this system during the 1970s,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Godsell |first=Andrew |title=Planet Football |year=2012 |isbn=978-1471616044 |page=40|publisher=Lulu.com }}</ref> at Dutch club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and the [[Netherlands national football team]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Augustyn |first=Adam |title=Rinus Michels |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rinus-Michels |access-date=7 August 2023 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> However, some authors credit teams such as the Austrian [[Wunderteam]] of the 1930s or the [[Golden Team|Golden Team of Hungary]] of the 1950s for having played in a similar style to Total Football.<ref name="HesseSimpson" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=McDougall |first=Alan |title=Contested Fields: A Global History of Modern Football |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2020 |isbn=978-1487594565 |pages=113}}</ref> Both sides were influenced by [[Jimmy Hogan]], who was in turn influenced by the [[combination game]].<ref name="Panenka" /><ref name="Guardian2003" /><ref name="Marcotti" />

Rinus Michels, who played under Reynolds, later became manager of Ajax in 1965. Michels developed the tactics of Total Football after 1970, most importantly with the introduction of [[Forward (association football)|forward]] Johan Cruyff, perhaps the system's most famous exponent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/coaches/coach=33960/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304020009/http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/coaches/coach=33960/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 March 2008|title=Classic Coach: Rinus Michels|work=Classic Football|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association|access-date=13 June 2008}}</ref> Although Cruyff was fielded as centre forward, Michels encouraged Cruyff to roam freely around the pitch, using technical ability and intelligence to exploit the weaknesses in the opposition and create chances. Cruyff's teammates also worked to adapt themselves accordingly, regularly switching positions to ensure tactical roles in the team were consistently filled.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150930160041/http://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=1043/profile.html 'FIFA Classic Player: The Netherlands' Grand Master]. FIFA.com. Retrieved 14 July 2014</ref> Austrian coach [[Ernst Happel]] reworked the theory to introduce strength, encouraging his players to play tougher during his spells at [[ADO Den Haag]] and [[Feyenoord]]. Happel also managed the Netherlands national team to a runner-up finish in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]].

The major component was the use of space, with the need to consistently create space central to the concept of Total Football. Former Ajax defender [[Barry Hulshoff]] described it as "[the thing] we discussed the whole time. Cruyff always talked about where to run and where to stand, and when not to move".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/football/features/newsid_3301000/3301407.stm|title=Johan Cruyff: The Total Footballer|work=Sport Academy|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=13 June 2008 | date=10 December 2003}}</ref> He further elaborated that position switching was only made possible due to apt spatial awareness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/UK/japan-sport-footballculture-teams-ground-ajax.htm|title=Ground Breaking Team: Ajax 1973|work=Football Culture|publisher=The British Council in Japan|access-date=13 June 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217125531/http://www.britishcouncil.org/UK/japan-sport-footballculture-teams-ground-ajax.htm|archive-date=17 December 2007}}</ref> He also described Total Football being [[Proactivity|proactive]], as well as highlighting the use of pressing, which would be used to win back the ball or put the opposition under considerable pressure.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/south-africa-world-cup-2010/World-Cup-2010-Dutch-were.6413230.jp|title=World Cup 2010: Dutch were pioneers of Total Football, but after exporting it to Spain must now stop opponents at their own game|last=Wilson|first=Jonathan|author-link=Jonathan Wilson (journalist/author)|date=11 July 2010|access-date=24 July 2010|work=[[The Scotsman]]}}</ref> Michels and Cruyff saw unprecedented success with the system, winning eight [[Eredivisie]] titles, three [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]], and one [[1972 Intercontinental Cup|Intercontinental Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/y=2005/m=12/news=are-the-champions-101662.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208150054/http://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/y=2005/m=12/news=are-the-champions-101662.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 December 2015 |title=We are the champions |publisher=FIFA.com |date=11 December 2005 |access-date=24 March 2016}}</ref> The stark rise of Total Football and its attacking prowess was also linked with the "death of ''[[Catenaccio]]''", an Italian system reliant heavily on defence promoted by [[Helenio Herrera]]'s [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] during the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europeancuphistory.com/euro72.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083240/http://www.europeancuphistory.com/euro72.html|url-status=usurped|archive-date=29 September 2007|title=Season 1971-72|publisher=European Cup History|access-date=13 June 2008}}</ref>

The Total Football system was prone to defeat, experienced notably in the final of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] contested by the Dutch and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=39/overview.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911111241/http://fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=39/overview.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 September 2007|title=1974 FIFA World Cup Germany: Dutch take plaudits but Germany take the prize|work=Previous FIFA World Cups|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association|access-date=13 June 2008}}</ref> Michels and Cruyff saw their ability to introduce playmaking stifled in the second half of the match by the effective marking of [[Berti Vogts]].

Building further on the foundations of Total Football, a new tactical system developed in [[FC Barcelona]] (particularly under manager [[Pep Guardiola]]) and the [[Spain men's national football team|Spain national team]] during the late 2000s and early 2010s.
