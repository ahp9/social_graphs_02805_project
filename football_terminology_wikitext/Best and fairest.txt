In Australian sport, the '''best and fairest''' award recognises the player(s) adjudged to have had the best performance in a game or over a season for a given sporting club or competition. The awards are sometimes dependent on not receiving a suspension for misconduct or breaching the rules during that season.  It is similar to [[most valuable player]] (MVP) awards in other team sports.

In the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), the [[Brownlow Medal]] is awarded to the player who, provided he has not been suspended during the season, receives the most votes from the [[umpire (Australian rules football)|umpires]] for being the fairest and best player in games during the [[season (sports)|home-and-away season]]. In each game, the umpires award three votes to the player they judge to be the best afield in that game, two votes to the second-best player, and one vote to the third-best player. The votes are counted at a gala function on the Monday preceding the [[grand final|Grand Final]]. The eligibility of suspended or reprimanded players due to minor offences to win the award has frequently been questioned.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brownlow shake-up|date=28 September 2011|first=Jesse|last=Hogan|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/brownlow-shakeup-20110927-1kvfv.html#ixzz2SFLJZtcb|location=Melbourne|work=The Age}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-02-18/only-tweaking-likely-for-brownlow/1521434|title=Only tweaking likely for Brownlow|date=18 February 2005}}</ref>

Another best and fairest honour, the [[Leigh Matthews Trophy]], is voted on by the AFL's players and awarded by their [[trade union]], the [[AFL Players Association]]. Unlike the Brownlow, players who have served disciplinary suspensions during the season are still eligible to win this award.

The oldest such award is the [[Magarey Medal]], awarded to the "fairest and most brilliant" player in the [[South Australian National Football League]] (SANFL). The award was created by [[William Ashley Magarey]]—then chairman of the league—and was first awarded in 1898.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanfl.com.au/the_sanfl/history_of_the_sanfl/|title=History of the SANFL|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619232001/http://www.sanfl.com.au/the_sanfl/history_of_the_sanfl/|archive-date=2010-06-19}}</ref>
