'''Stephen McClaren''' (born 3 May 1961) is an English [[association football|football]] coach and former player who is currently the [[manager (association football)|manager]] of the [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica national team]].<ref name="may23">{{Cite web |title=Backroom Staff Appointments Confirmed |url=https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/mitchell-van-der-gaag-and-steve-mcclaren-appointments-confirmed |publisher=Manchester United |date=23 May 2022 |access-date=23 May 2022 }}</ref>

McClaren began his coaching career with [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], before joining [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in 1995. In 1999, McClaren was hired by Manchester United to be [[Brian Kidd]]'s replacement as [[Alex Ferguson]]'s assistant manager. He held that position for two years, until he was hired as manager of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. During his tenure, Middlesbrough won their first major trophy, the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] in [[2004 Football League Cup final|2004]]. They were also [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] runners-up in [[2006 UEFA Cup final|2006]]. McClaren was appointed manager of the [[England national football team|England national team]] in August 2006, but was dismissed a year later after England failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2008]], with his tactics and player selections being subject to strong media criticism.<ref name = "McClaren sacked as England coach">{{cite news |title=McClaren sacked as England coach |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7100393.stm |website=BBC Sport |date=22 November 2007 |access-date=19 January 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldsoccer.about.com/b/2007/11/26/is-the-england-managers-job-a-poisoned-chalice.htm |title=Is The England Manager's Job A Poisoned Chalice? |website=Worldsoccer.about.com |access-date=19 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204045711/http://worldsoccer.about.com/b/2007/11/26/is-the-england-managers-job-a-poisoned-chalice.htm |archive-date=4 December 2007 }}</ref>

In 2008, McClaren was appointed manager of Dutch club [[FC Twente|Twente]], with whom he won the club's first ever [[Eredivisie]] championship in 2010. Soon after, he took over at [[VfL Wolfsburg]] in Germany, though he was dismissed mid-season due to poor results. After a short spell as manager of [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], he returned to Twente in 2012. His second stint with Twente was less successful than his first, however, and McClaren resigned in early 2013. He returned to Derby later that year, leading the club to the play-offs in the 2013–14 season, but the club failed to win promotion, and he was dismissed in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32878657|title=Steve McClaren: Derby County sack head coach|date=25 May 2015|website=BBC Sport}}</ref> He was soon appointed head coach of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], but was dismissed after less than a year after winning only six of his 28 Premier League matches in charge. He had a second spell as Derby manager from October 2016 to March 2017,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37630067|title=Steve McClaren: Derby County reappoint former boss|date=12 October 2016|website=BBC Sport}}</ref> and, in 2018, McClaren was appointed manager of [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], before being dismissed in April 2019.

As a child, McClaren attended [[Millthorpe School|Nunthorpe Grammar School]] after passing his [[eleven-plus]], preferring it over a closer school because of the emphasis which was placed on [[sport]]s.<ref name="The making of an England manager">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/4973056.stm|title=The making of an England manager|first=James|last=Clarke|website=[[BBC News]]|date=4 May 2006|access-date=2 January 2008}}</ref> In order to attend, he had to cycle a daily four-mile round trip across York. This is cited as an example of his determination to succeed in sport.<ref name="The making of an England manager"/> At school, he played [[Rugby union|rugby]], [[tennis]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]] and was [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of the school's [[Association football|football]] team. He also played for York Boys under-15 team and represented the county of Yorkshire. Playing as [[midfielder]], McClaren is remembered as being a "tidy" player, "skilful on the ball" and "head and shoulders above the rest."<ref name="The making of an England manager"/>

==Playing career==
{{expand section|date=December 2013}}
As a player, McClaren was a [[midfielder]] who spent most of his career in the lower leagues of [[Football in England|English football]]. The bulk of his playing career was with [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], who he joined in 1979 at the age of 18 after leaving school, He went on to play 178 games scoring 16 goals before leaving in 1985. He then played for [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] between 1985 and 1988, making 25 appearances.<ref>{{Cite web |title=England Head Coach - Steve McClaren |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/teammgr/Mgr_McClaren.html#:~:text=Club(s):%20A%20midfielder,Sacked%2022%20November%202007. |access-date=2025-09-17 |website=www.englandfootballonline.com}}</ref>

During 1987, he joined [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] (on loan) making only eight appearances. In 1988, he moved to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and played 61 times, scoring two goals. He joined his final club, [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], in 1989. He played 33 times for Oxford, before an injury forced him to retire in 1992.<ref name="Profile">[https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4915602.stm "Rock solid Steve"] – BBC Sport profile, 4 May 2006</ref>

==Managerial career==
===Early coaching===
After retiring from playing, McClaren began his coaching career as a youth and reserve team coach at Oxford United, where [[Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)|Denis Smith]] was manager. He moved back to Derby County in 1995, where he was assistant manager to [[Jim Smith (footballer, born 1940)|Jim Smith]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Hodges|first=Vicki|title=Jim Smith backs protege McClaren|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=4 May 2006|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4969256.stm|access-date=18 August 2008}}</ref> The pair won promotion to the [[Premier League]] in their [[1995–96 in English football|first season in charge]], establishing themselves in this division and later enjoyed further consolidation in the top flight.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/steve-mcclaren-career-timeline-look-9414188|title=Steve McClaren career timeline: A look back, ahead of his appointment as Newcastle head coach |website=Chronicle Live|date=4 May 2006|access-date=24 October 2016}}</ref>

In early 1999, McClaren moved to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as assistant to [[Alex Ferguson]], replacing [[Brian Kidd]]. At the time, he was so little known that he was introduced by United chairman [[Martin Edwards]] as "Steve McClaridge", perhaps confusing him with the former [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] striker [[Steve Claridge]].<ref name="the thinking man's coach">

In October 2000, McClaren was made a coach in the [[England national football team|England national team]] by caretaker-manager [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1953)|Peter Taylor]].<ref>{{cite news|title=McClaren joins the fast lane|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=22 October 2000|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2002/984945.stm|access-date=26 February 2008}}</ref> He retained the position under permanent manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] until November 2002, combining the job with his roles at club level.<ref>{{cite news|title=McClaren quits as Eriksson stays|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=1 November 2002|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/2386317.stm|access-date=26 February 2008 }}</ref> However, he returned to assist Eriksson as assistant manager shortly before [[UEFA Euro 2004]] as Brian Kidd had undergone surgery for [[prostate cancer]].<ref>{{cite news|title=McClaren nets England role|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=14 May 2004|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/england/3679479.stm|access-date=26 February 2008}}</ref> He remained in the role up to and including the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] finals.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

===Middlesbrough===
At the end of the [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01]] season, McClaren began looking for a managerial job, having decided his chances of succeeding Ferguson at [[Old Trafford]] were slim; at the time, Ferguson was planning to retire the following summer, but would ultimately remain in charge of United for a further 11 seasons.<ref name="Steve McClaren in focus"/> With a positive reputation and closely linked with three Premier League vacancies, [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] chairman [[Steve Gibson (businessman)|Steve Gibson]] won the race to appoint him after McClaren turned down [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. His appointment came after the resignation of former Manchester United captain [[Bryan Robson]], who had been in charge of the [[Teesside]] club for seven years and established them as a Premier League club.<ref>{{cite news|title=McClaren is new Boro boss|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=12 June 2001|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/middlesbrough/1384386.stm|access-date=26 February 2008}}</ref> In his first season, Middlesbrough reached the FA Cup semi-final, knocking out his previous employers Manchester United in the fourth round,<ref>{{cite news|title=Boro sink Man Utd|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=26 January 2002|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/1780868.stm|access-date=18 August 2008}}</ref> but lost 0–1 to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Arsenal break brave Boro|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=18 April 2002|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/1924953.stm|access-date=18 August 2008}}</ref> They finished 12th in the league, a small improvement on the previous season's 14th-place finish.

McClaren's five-year tenure on Teesside saw him establish himself as Middlesbrough's most successful manager as he made the often difficult transition from coach to manager.

After [[Sven-Göran Eriksson|Eriksson]] announced in January 2006 that he would leave as England manager after the 2006 World Cup finals, McClaren was placed on [[The Football Association|the FA]]'s shortlist to succeed him, alongside [[Sam Allardyce]], [[Alan Curbishley]], [[Martin O'Neill]] and [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Who will get Sven's job?|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=24 April 2006|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4937826.stm|access-date =15 August 2008}}</ref> The FA first offered the position to Scolari,<ref>{{cite news|title=FA moves closer to Scolari deal|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=28 April 2006|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4949118.stm|access-date=15 August 2008}}</ref> but he rejected the offer, claiming that the role would mean excessive media intrusion in his life.<ref>{{cite news|title=England job not for me – Scolari|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=28 April 2006|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4955490.stm | access-date =15 August 2008 }}</ref> McClaren, however, was subsequently announced as Eriksson's successor on 4 May 2006 after signing a four-year contract.<ref name="McClaren named as England manager">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4969592.stm|title=McClaren named as England manager|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=4 May 2006|access-date=19 January 2010}}</ref> The nature of his appointment earned him the nickname "Second Choice Steve".<ref>{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Matt|title=McClaren gets a second chance, but he sure doesn't deserve it|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 November 2007|url=https://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/17/mcclaren_gets_a_second_chance.html|access-date=15 August 2008 | location=London}}</ref> The appointment was praised by the likes of Alex Ferguson and [[Trevor Brooking]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Reaction to McClaren appointment|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=4 May 2006|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4973416.stm|access-date=15 August 2008}}</ref> McClaren assumed control of the national team on 1 August 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=McClaren ready for England task|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=1 August 2006|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/5232678.stm|access-date=15 August 2008}}</ref> McClaren chose popular former England coach [[Terry Venables]] as his assistant,<ref>{{cite news|title=Venables named England assistant|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=11 August 2006|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4779133.stm |access-date=15 August 2008}}</ref> a move seen by some as an attempt to counter the lack of enthusiasm for McClaren.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wallace|first=Sam|title=McClaren insists on return of Venables to England set-up|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=23 May 2006|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/mcclaren-insists-on-return-of-venables-to-england-setup-479347.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220525/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/mcclaren-insists-on-return-of-venables-to-england-setup-479347.html |archive-date=25 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|access-date=15 August 2008 | location=London}}</ref> He also hired [[public relations]] guru [[Max Clifford]] to manage his relationship with the [[Media of the United Kingdom|media]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Clifford to guide McClaren|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=26 July 2006|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/5192270.stm|access-date=15 August 2008 | first=Simon | last=Austin}}</ref>

McClaren's first decision was to choose the new England captain. He decided to give the arm band to [[John Terry]], the [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] defender and captain who at the time had 24 England caps, saying: "I'm convinced he will prove to be one of the best captains England has ever had."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4782197.stm|title=Terry named new England skipper|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=10 August 2006|access-date=10 March 2008}}</ref> In his first squad, McClaren dropped many of the national team's older players including [[Sol Campbell]], [[David James (footballer, born 1970)|David James]] and former captain [[David Beckham]], saying he was planning for "a different direction".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/internationals/article1218664.ece|title=Mac the knife ends Beckham era with a chat on the phone|first=Sam|last=Wallace|date=12 August 2006|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=12 August 2006|location=London|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827161656/http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/internationals/article1218664.ece|archive-date=27 August 2006}}</ref> McClaren, however, stated that there was still a chance that Beckham could be recalled in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,2483_1933098,00.html |title=Beckham gives Macca a problem |website=Teamtalk |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302211953/http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0%2C16368%2C2483_1933098%2C00.html |archive-date= 2 March 2007 }}</ref>

After starting qualification for [[UEFA Euro 2008]] well with two wins, England hit a poor run of form between October 2006 and March 2007 with only one goal scored in five matches, by which time they had fallen to fourth in their [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group E|qualification group]]. During a match against [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] in March 2007, McClaren and the England team received abuse from supporters during a poor performance in a 3–0 win. McClaren walked out of the post-match press conference after only two minutes of questions, saying, "Gentlemen, if you want to write whatever you want to write, you can write it because that is all I am going to say. Thank you."<ref>{{cite news |title=McClaren appeals to England fans |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/6498347.stm |website=BBC Sport |date=29 March 2007 |access-date=24 May 2010 }}</ref>

In May 2007, McClaren made a U-turn by recalling David Beckham into the England squad. England subsequently had a run of four wins from six matches, which boosted the country's hopes of [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying|qualification for Euro 2008]], before a defeat against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in October 2007 caused their qualification fate to fall out of their hands. The FA's chief executive, [[Brian Barwick]], gave his backing to McClaren, despite the defeat.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7050180.stm|title=FA boss gives backing to McClaren|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=18 October 2007|access-date=24 May 2010}}</ref> McClaren was also backed by players [[Phil Neville]] and [[Steven Gerrard]], his predecessor Eriksson,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7090907.stm|title=Neville feels McClaren must stay|website=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=17 November 2007|date=13 November 2007}}</ref> and the chief executive of the [[League Managers Association]], [[John Barnwell]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7096686.stm|title=McClaren critics anger Barnwell|website=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=17 November 2007|date=15 November 2007}}</ref>

The results of other matches in England's qualification group meant that England would qualify as the second place team by avoiding a loss in their final group match against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], who had already qualified for the tournament. They would also qualify if Russia failed to beat Andorra. The match was played at Wembley on 21 November 2007 and England lost 3–2; coupled with Russia's victory over Andorra, this meant that England failed to qualify for Euro 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title=England 2–3 Croatia|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7103110.stm|website=BBC Sport|first=Jonathan|last=Stevenson|date=21 November 2007|access-date=15 May 2012}}</ref> It was the first time since the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] that England had not qualified for a major tournament, and the first time they had missed the European Championships since [[UEFA Euro 1984]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Collett |first=Mike |date=22 November 2007 |title=England Euro hopes ended by Croatia |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-euro-england-sbar-idUKL2050521120071122 |access-date=16 October 2022}}</ref>

The following day, the FA held an emergency meeting and decided to sack McClaren from his post along with his assistant manager Terry Venables.<ref name="McClaren sacked as England coach"/> There had been considerable media criticism over McClaren's tactics and player selection, particularly the poor results without Beckham in the lineup, and then having the inexperienced Scott Carson instead of Paul Robinson for the crucial match against Croatia.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7106870.stm | title=Where it went wrong for McClaren | date=22 November 2007 }}</ref> McClaren's tenure was the second shortest of any England manager, spanning just 18 games in 16 months, only superseded by Sam Allardyce's one game in 67 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37483344|title=Sam Allardyce: England manager leaves after one match in charge|date=27 September 2016|website=BBC Sport}}</ref> On 14 December 2007, the FA announced [[Fabio Capello]] as McClaren's replacement commencing from 7 January 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/dec/14/newsstory.sport18|title=Benvenuto Fabio!

McClaren made a good start to the [[2008–09 Eredivisie|2008–09 season]]. The club went on to secure second place in the [[Eredivisie]] behind winners [[AZ Alkmaar|AZ]], reached the final of the [[2008–09 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] (losing on penalties to [[SC Heerenveen|Heerenveen]])<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8054797.stm|title=McClaren suffers Dutch Cup agony |date=17 May 2009|website=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=18 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Lawrence |first1=Amy |title=All hail the season's top English coach: Steve McClaren |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/may/17/steve-mcclaren-fctwente-cup-final |access-date=2 September 2020 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 May 2009}}</ref> and on the European front, the club survived group stages in the [[2008–09 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], having beaten amongst others [[Racing de Santander]] and [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], managed by McClaren's predecessor at Twente, [[Fred Rutten]]. It was the first time in 30 years that the club had remained in European competition beyond winter. Twente were eventually knocked out on penalties in the Round of 32 by [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=622909&cc=5739 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304171048/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=622909&cc=5739 |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 March 2009 |title=Uefa Cup – Espn Fc |website=ESPN Soccernet |date=27 February 2009 |access-date=4 May 2013}}</ref>

At the start of the [[2009–10 Eredivisie|2009–10 campaign]], McClaren's second season at Twente, there were question-marks over how well newcomers [[Bryan Ruiz]] and [[Miroslav Stoch]] would be able to replace the departed [[Eljero Elia]] and [[Marko Arnautović]], who had been at the core of Twente's second-place finish in the league the preceding year. McClaren, however, led the team to some impressive results, with Twente reaching the top of the Eredivisie in October and remaining top throughout the next few months. Twente, which had never won an Eredivisie title in its history, continued to top the league in the latter part of the season, holding off the likes of renowned competitors [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], and seriously emerged as title favourites. They also reached the first knockout round of the inaugural [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]], where they were defeated by [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]]. McClaren signed a one-year extension to his contract in October 2009.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

On 2 May 2010, Twente were crowned champions for the first time in their history after a 2–0 win away to [[NAC Breda]]. On winning the Eredivisie, McClaren became the first Englishman to manage a team to a top-level domestic league title since [[Bobby Robson]] with [[FC Porto|Porto]] in [[1995–96 Primeira Liga|1996]] (Robson also won the Dutch title with PSV in [[1990–91 Eredivisie|1991]] and [[1991–92 Eredivisie|1992]]).<ref name="unlikely">{{cite news|title=Steve McClaren the Boss again as Dutch hail unlikely hero|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article7113268.ece|first=Matt|last=Dickinson|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=1 May 2010|access-date=23 June 2010 | location=London}}{{dead link|date=September 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/news?slug=ap-dutchleague|title=McClaren's Twente crowned Dutch league champions|website=[[Yahoo!

According to McClaren: "The relationship I had with Bobby was very special. He was a good friend and was of big influence on my decision to join Twente. I'd like to think that he'll be watching from a cloud up above and wishes us the best as we play the last game in the league against NAC."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/6640049/__McClaren_in_voetspoor_Robson__.html?p=1,1|title=McClaren in voetspoor Robson|newspaper=[[De Telegraaf]]|date=1 May 2010|access-date=4 May 2010|language=nl}}</ref>

Twente won 16 of 17 home matches in the Eredivisie league that season and lost just two away. Twente withstood immense pressure from [[Martin Jol]]'s Ajax (who won their last 14 games in a row and had a goal difference of +86, more than double Twente's +40) during the second half of the season, and trumped the [[Amsterdam]] side by one point difference on the last day of the league to claim the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1046/Eredivisie/article/detail/480872/2010/05/03/Traditionele-top-drie-laat-zich-weer-ringeloren.dhtml|title=Traditionele top drie laat zich weer ringeloren (480872)|newspaper=Algemeen Dagblad |date=3 May 2010|access-date=4 May 2010|language=nl}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Louise|last=Taylor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/02/steve-mcclaren-nac-breda-twente|title=Steve McClaren goes from zero to hero as FC Twente win Dutch title|date=2 May 2010|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=4 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Upon winning the championship, McClaren stated: "Winning the Carling Cup with Middlesbrough was special but this is pretty much right up at the top of anything I've ever done.

===VfL Wolfsburg===
Despite winning the Dutch league with Twente, McClaren left the club on 11 May 2010 to take over as manager of [[Bundesliga]] side [[VfL Wolfsburg]], making him the first Englishman to manage a German top flight football club.<ref name="Steve McClaren named Wolfsburg manager">{{cite news|title=Steve McClaren named Wolfsburg manager|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8674543.stm|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=11 May 2010|access-date=27 September 2015}}</ref> Wolfsburg lost their first three league matches under McClaren – including a 2–1 injury time away loss to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] on the opening day of the season, followed by a 4–3 home loss to [[1.

Wolfsburg then won their next two matches convincingly to rise to sixth in the table.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Despite struggling in the league, on 23 December 2010 the club publicly showed a vote of confidence in McClaren. Due to further poor results, however, on 7 February 2011, the board decided to dismiss McClaren with immediate effect.<ref>{{cite news |title=Steve McClaren dismissed by German club Wolfsburg |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/9390250.stm |website=BBC Sport |date=7 February 2011 |access-date=7 February 2011 }}</ref>

McClaren made his first match back as manager for the second time when Twente hammered [[RKC Waalwijk]] 5–0. His return was welcomed by the club's supporters, who wore "Welcome Back Steve" T-shirts during Saturday's game.<ref>{{cite news |title=Steve McClaren makes winning return to FC Twente |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16671309 |website=BBC Sport |date=22 January 2012 |access-date=19 February 2012}}</ref> In the January transfer window, McClaren caused controversy when he sold one of their best strikers, [[Marc Janko]], to Porto for approximately £5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Janko leaves Twente for Porto |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11915/7472721/Janko-leaves-Twente-for-Porto |website=[[Sky Sports]] |date=1 February 2012 |access-date=19 February 2012}}</ref> Despite this, McClaren invested money to sign [[Wesley Verhoek]] from [[ADO Den Haag]] for £1.5&nbsp;million (a player McClaren had previously tried to sign while in charge at Nottingham Forest but the proposed deal fell through<ref>{{cite news |title=Wesley Verhoek calls off move to Nottingham Forest |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/14443696 |date=9 August 2011 |access-date=15 May 2012 |website=BBC Sport}}</ref>) and [[Glynor Plet]] from [[Heracles Almelo]] for £1.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |title=HOLLAND/ OFFICIAL, Verhoek and Plet join Twente |url=http://www.footballpress.net/index.php?action=read&idsel=98003 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120801025634/http://www.footballpress.net/index.php?action=read&idsel=98003 |url-status=usurped |archive-date=1 August 2012 |website=Football Press |date=1 February 2012 |access-date=19 February 2012}}</ref> McClaren also signed [[Joshua John]] and [[Daniel Fernandes (footballer)|Daniel Fernandes]] on a free transfer.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

After a disappointing sixth place, Twente invested in new players including [[Dušan Tadić]] and [[Luc Castaignos]]. Twente made it through the group stages of the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]], while winning the first six league matches. McClaren became the second foreign trainer in the Eredivisie who has coached more than 100 matches.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} After growing criticism from supporters, McClaren resigned his position on 26 February 2013,<ref>{{cite news |last=Gratton |first=Doug |url=https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/steve-mcclaren-resigns-as-twente-coach-gdwlfchptfh |title=Steve McClaren resigns as Twente coach |newspaper=[[The Times]] |location=London |date=26 February 2013 |access-date=4 May 2013}}</ref> stating: "We agree the Club is bigger than any one individual and Twente is too big in my heart to stand in the way of its progress."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fctwente.nl/blog/2013/02/steve-mcclaren-vertrekt-bij-fc-twente/ |title=»Steve McClaren vertrekt bij FC Twente |publisher=FC Twente |date=26 February 2013 |access-date=4 May 2013}}</ref>

===Derby County===
In September 2013, McClaren returned to Derby County when he was appointed [[head coach]] to replace [[Nigel Clough]], signing a two-and-a-half-year contract.<ref name="McClarenDerbyManager">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24331558 |title=Steve McClaren named as Derby County head coach |website=BBC Sport |date=30 September 2013}}</ref> He appointed former Derby winger [[Paul Simpson (footballer)|Paul Simpson]] and former Manchester United goalkeeping coach [[Eric Steele]] to his backroom staff.<ref name="McClarenDerbyManager" /> Derby's first match following McClaren's appointment was at home to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], though academy manager [[Darren Wassall]] took charge of the team. With Derby trailing 4–1 at half time, McClaren entered the home dressing room to give a "rousing" speech to inspire a Derby fight back for a 4–4 draw.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11696/8952170/ |title= Championship: Steve McClaren speech inspires Derby against Ipswich |date=3 October 2013 |website=Sky Sports}}</ref> McClaren's first two games in charge brought successive victories, as he earned Derby their first league home win of the season with a tenth successive victory over [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] (3–1)<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24349291 |title= Derby 3–1 Leeds |date=5 October 2013 |website=BBC Sport}}</ref> and inflicted [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]'s first home defeat of the season with a 3–2 away win.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24502727 |title=Watford 2 – 3 Derby |date=19 October 2013 |website=BBC Sport}}</ref> The Watford victory earned McClaren the [[League Managers Association|LMA]] Performance of the Week award.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/mcclaren-receives-lma-award-1135577.aspx|title=McClaren receives LMA Award |publisher=Derby County F.C. |date=25 October 2013}}</ref>

After Derby picked up 19 points from a possible 21 in December 2013, McClaren was awarded the Championship Manager of the Month award.<ref>{{cite web |title=Head Coach claims December's managerial gong |url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/mcclaren-wins-motm-award-1284695.aspx |access-date=20 July 2014 |publisher=Derby County F.C. |date=10 January 2014}}</ref> Derby went on to finish third in the Championship in the 2013–14 season, amassing 85 points and qualifying for the [[2014 Football League play-offs#Championship|Championship play-offs]]. After beating [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] over two legs in the semi-finals,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27273132 |title=Derby County 4-1 Brighton & Hove Albion |author=Emons, Michael |website=BBC Sport}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27269915|title=Brighton & Hove Albion 1-2 Derby County |author=Hassan, Nabil |website=BBC Sport}}</ref> Derby faced McClaren's former employers QPR in the final at [[Wembley Stadium]], where they lost 1–0 to a last minute [[Bobby Zamora]] goal.

Derby enjoyed a strong opening two-thirds of the [[2014–15 Derby County F.C. season|2014–15 season]], topping the table on three separate occasions and reaching the League Cup quarter-finals. However, after a 2–0 victory over [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on 24 February took Derby to the top of the division, their form nose-dived and they managed just two wins, against eventually relegated [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and Blackpool, in their remaining 13 fixtures. Despite the loan signings of [[Darren Bent]], [[Tom Ince]] and [[Jesse Lingard]], they missed out on the play-offs altogether after a 3–0 defeat at home to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] on the last day of the season, when a point would have sufficed. The drastic loss in form was attributed by McClaren to injuries to key players, especially striker [[Chris Martin (footballer, born 1988)|Chris Martin]], although local press also believed that constant speculation linking McClaren to the [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] job had been a contributing factor. On 25 May 2015, McClaren was dismissed by Derby.<ref>{{cite news |title=Steve McClaren: Derby County sack head coach |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32878657 |website=BBC Sport |date=25 May 2015 |access-date=10 June 2015}}</ref>
