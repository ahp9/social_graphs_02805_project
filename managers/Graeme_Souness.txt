'''Graeme James Souness''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|uː|n|ᵻ|s}}; born 6 May 1953) is a Scottish former professional [[Association football|football]] player, manager and television [[pundit]].

A [[midfielder]], Souness achieved his greatest period of success as an integral part of the [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] team of the late 1970s and early 1980s, during which he won five [[Football League First Division|First Division]] titles and three [[European Cup]] trophies. He was [[Captain (association football)|captain]] for three seasons at Liverpool until his departure to [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] in 1984. Souness later became [[player-manager]] for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], leading the club to three [[List of Scottish football champions|Scottish titles]] and four league cups. His final game as a player came in the closing minutes of Rangers' final match of the [[1989–90 Scottish Premier Division|1989–90 season]], which was his only appearance of the season.

Souness continued as Rangers coach for a further year before joining [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] as manager for the [[1991–92 Football League First Division|1991–92]] English First Division season. He went on to have spells at [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], [[Torino F.C.|Torino]], [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].

At international level, Souness gained 54 caps for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], captaining the team on 27 occasions.<ref name = "totals">{{cite web |url=http://londonhearts.com/scotland/misc/captainsbytotgames.html |title=Scotland Captains by Total Games as Captain |work=londonhearts.com |access-date=16 June 2024}}</ref><ref name = "captain">{{cite web |url=https://scotlandepistles.com/2016/10/17/graeme-souness-makes-his-debut/|title=Graeme Souness makes his debut|work=The Scotland Epistles Football Magazine |date=17 October 2016 |access-date=16 June 2024}}</ref>

==Club career==
===Early career===
Souness was brought up in the [[Saughton]] Mains area of [[Edinburgh]], and supported local side [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/4371828.stm |title=Pulling at Hearts' strings |first=Clive |last=Lindsay |work=BBC Sport |date=24 October 2005 |access-date=19 December 2016}}</ref> and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Focus on Graeme Souness from Shoot! 1986 |url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/617|publisher=LFC History|access-date=20 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/europa-league-final-could-be-the-greatest-night-of-rangers-players-lives-x3gwt2rd2 |title=Europa League final could be the greatest night of Rangers players' lives |first=Graeme |last=Souness |newspaper=The Sunday Times |date=15 May 2022 |access-date=18 October 2022 |quote=Although I grew up in Hearts territory, I was awed by the sheer scale and spectacle of Rangers' stadium as a boy. I vividly remember going with a Union Jack draped across my shoulders to show my support and enjoy the special atmosphere on those nights under the lights. I was always playing on Saturdays, so midweek games were the only ones I could go to.}}</ref> As a teenager, Souness played for local boys' club North Merchiston.

Souness' career began as an apprentice at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] under [[Bill Nicholson (footballer)|Bill Nicholson]]. He signed professional forms as a 15-year-old in 1968. Frustrated at a lack of first-team opportunities, the teenage Souness told Nicholson he should be selected for the first team.<ref name="mullin">{{cite news |last=Mullin |first=John |title=Graeme Souness – 'I just grew up having this ridiculous belief in my own ability' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/10/20/graeme-souness-just-grew-having-ridiculous-belief-ability/ |access-date=16 June 2024 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=20 October 2017}}</ref> Souness made one first-team appearance for Spurs, in a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] tie as a substitute.

During the summer of 1972, Souness played in the [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|North American Soccer League]] for the [[Montreal Olympique]]. He appeared in 10 of his team's 14 matches and was named in the league's All-Star team for that season.

===Middlesbrough===
Spurs sold Souness to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] for £30,000 in 1972. He made his first appearance for Middlesbrough on 6 January 1973 in a 2–1 league defeat to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] at [[Craven Cottage]]. His first goal came on 11 December 1973 in a 3–0 league victory over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] at [[Ayresome Park]].

Souness' tenacious style began to garner acclaim during his time at Middlesbrough. His first season saw Middlesbrough finish fourth, two places and 14 points short of promotion. [[Jack Charlton]] was appointed Middlesbrough manager, his first managerial post, in May 1973. One of Charlton's first signings was experienced former [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] midfielder [[Bobby Murdoch]], a fellow Scot whom Souness later cited as an important influence in the development of his playing style.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/1332240.stm |title=Bobby Murdoch: An obituary |work=BBC Sport |date=15 May 2001 |access-date=19 December 2016}}</ref> Promotion as champions of the [[Football League Division Two|Second Division]] followed in [[1973–74 in English football|1973–74]]. Souness' influence was demonstrated when he scored a [[hat-trick]] in the season's final fixture, an 8–0 victory over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].

===Liverpool===
Souness' playing career is best remembered for his seven seasons at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], where he won five [[Football League First Division#Winners he ran up the fieldst Division (1889-1992)|League Championships]], three [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]s and four [[EFL Cup|League Cups]].

Souness' time at [[Anfield]] began in January 1978 as a replacement for veteran [[Ian Callaghan]]. After winning his first [[1976–77 European Cup|European Cup]] in 1977, Liverpool manager [[Bob Paisley]] sought reinforcements by signing three Scottish players, all of whom were to contribute substantially to further success. Central defender [[Alan Hansen]] arrived from [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] for £110,000. [[Kenny Dalglish]] – an established Scottish international – signed from [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] for a then British record fee of £440,000. Souness formed the final part of the Scottish triumvirate, leaving Middlesbrough in acrimonious circumstances for a club-record fee of £350,000 on 10 January 1978.<ref>[http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/415 lfchistory.net Player Profile]</ref>

Souness' Liverpool debut came in a 1–0 league victory over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at [[The Hawthorns]] on 14 January 1978. His first goal – a volley from just inside the penalty box, eventually awarded fans' goal of the season – came in a 3–1 win over rivals [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at Anfield on 25 February 1978.

Souness played a pivotal role in Liverpool's retention of the [[1977–78 European Cup|European Cup]] against [[Club Brugge KV|FC Bruges]] in [[1978 European Cup Final|1978]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], providing the pass for Kenny Dalglish to score the match's only goal.

Sustained success followed. Souness's first League title medals were won in seasons [[1978–79 in English football|1978–79]] and [[1979–80 in English football|1979–80]]. A second [[1980–81 European Cup|European Cup]] medal for Souness arrived in [[1981 European Cup Final|1981]] with a 1–0 victory over [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] – the culmination of a campaign in which Souness scored a hat-trick in the quarter-final against [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]].

This burst of success prompted Paisley to award Souness the club captaincy for season [[1981–82 in English football|1981–82]], to the chagrin of the incumbent [[Phil Thompson]] who had made some errors that season and with whom Paisley had a vicious row during one match at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].<ref name="amazon.co.uk">{{cite book|title=No Half Measures: Amazon.co.uk: Graeme Souness, Bob Harris: Books |date=28 March 1985 |id={{ASIN|0002181347|country=uk}} }}</ref> Thompson initially refused to speak to Souness, claiming he had "stolen the captaincy" from behind his back. This was the start of several long-running feuds between the two robust characters, and over the coming years, they would confront each other in various circumstances.<ref name="amazon.co.uk"/>

Under Souness' captaincy, two trophies followed as Liverpool regained the League championship and retained the League Cup, trophies that were successfully defended in season [[1982–83 in English football|1982–83]]. For the trophy award presentation after the 2–1 win over Manchester United in [[1983 Football League Cup Final|1983]], Souness stepped back and insisted that Paisley collect the trophy in the manager's retirement season.

In [[1983–84 in English football|1983–84]], Souness lifted three trophies. He scored the winning goal in the 1984 League Cup final replay at [[Maine Road]] against Merseyside rivals [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], the first [[Merseyside derby|all-Merseyside]] cup final.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Scragg |first1=Steven |title=The divine prophecy of Graeme Souness |url=https://thesefootballtimes.co/2016/02/18/the-divine-prophecy-of-graeme-souness/ |access-date=27 August 2020 |work=These Football Times |date=18 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Triggs-LE |first1=David |title=On this day: Merseyside unites for 1984 Milk Cup final |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/remembering-1984-milk-cup-final-6874410 |access-date=27 August 2020 |work=Liverpool Echo |date=25 March 2014}}</ref> Liverpool won the league title for the third consecutive season and reached the 1984 [[1983–84 European Cup|European Cup]] [[1984 European Cup Final|final]] after beating Romanian champions [[FC Dinamo București|Dinamo București]] in the semi-final 3–1 on aggregate. In an ill-tempered first leg at Anfield, Souness broke the jaw of Dinamo captain [[Lică Movilă]], which went unpunished by the referee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2871/special/2010/04/29/1899445/liverpool-special-the-reds-top-5-european-semi-final |title=Liverpool Special: The Reds' Top 5 European Semi-Final Victories |publisher=Goal.com |access-date=30 December 2012}}</ref> Liverpool won the [[1984 European Cup Final|1984]] final after a penalty shoot-out win over [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], with Souness scoring one of the penalties in the shootout.

Souness' Liverpool career ended in 1984 after 358 appearances and 56 goals.

===Sampdoria===
In 1984, Souness joined [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] for a fee of £650,000. In doing so he became the third Scot to play in the [[Italian Football Championship]] since its re-brand to [[Serie A]] in [[1929-30 Serie A|1929]]. In doing so he succeeded [[Denis Law]] and [[Joe Jordan]]<ref name=scotit>[https://www.rsssf.org/players/scot-players-in-it.html "Scottish Players and Coaches in Italy" rsssf.org, Last updated 9 July 2001, Davide Rota]</ref> (Law's Scots-raised [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] teammate [[Joe Baker]] spent the first six weeks of his life in [[Liverpool]] and was thus deemed English under international football rules of the time). Souness and England international [[Trevor Francis]]–a player at the [[Genoa]]-based club since 1982–added experience to an emerging group of future [[Italy national football team|Italian internationals]], including [[Roberto Mancini]], [[Pietro Vierchowod]] and [[Gianluca Vialli]].

In his first season, Souness succeeded Jordan to become the second Scot to play in a [[Coppa Italia]] final. Souness, in contrast to Jordan, collected a winner's medal. Sampdoria won the [[1985 Coppa Italia Final]] 3–1 on aggregate over Serie A rivals [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], securing the cup for the first time in club history.<ref name = coppa/> Souness scored the only goal of the game in the away first leg of the final.<ref name = coppa>{{cite web

===Rangers===
Souness' career in Italy ended in 1986 as he took up the position of [[Player-coach|player-manager]] at Rangers.<ref name="revolution">{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12403946.20_YEARS_ON_______THE_SOUNESS_REVOLUTION/ |title=20 years on...the Souness revolution|date=9 June 2006|newspaper=The Sunday Herald|last=Grant|first=Michael|access-date=1 December 2017}}</ref> His playing career at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] began inauspiciously. His competitive debut – in the opening match of the 1986–87 season, against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in his hometown of Edinburgh – saw him sent off after two yellow cards in the first 34 minutes.

Disciplinary problems – something that had recurred periodically throughout Souness's career – resurfaced on a number of occasions during his time as a player at Rangers, and the spell was also blighted by injury. He made 73 appearances in total for Rangers (50 in the league), scoring three goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/rangers/player.php?playerid=1367 |title=Rangers player Graeme Souness|publisher=Fitbastats.com|access-date=16 April 2017}}</ref> His final appearance as a player was at Ibrox in a 2–0 victory over [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] in Rangers' last home match of the [[1989–90 Scottish Premier Division|1989–90 season]], when he brought himself on for the final 20 minutes.

== International career ==
While a Middlesbrough player, Souness received his first [[international cap]] for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] on 30 October 1974 in a 3–0 friendly victory over [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]] at [[Hampden Park]].<ref name = "scotland"/> By the time Souness was selected by manager [[Ally McLeod]] for the Scotland squad for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] in Argentina, he had been awarded only six caps. His move to Liverpool increased his profile. Souness missed Scotland's first two matches, a defeat to [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and a draw with [[Iran national football team|Iran]], due to injury. He was selected for the final group match against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. Souness contributed to a 3–2 victory that nevertheless saw Scotland eliminated from the tournament on goal difference.<ref name = "my world cup"/>

Souness played in two further World Cups. The first, in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] in Spain, saw Souness play all three group stage matches. His first international goal arrived in the final game prior to elimination, a 2–2 draw with the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] in [[La Rosaleda Stadium|Málaga]].<ref name = "my world cup"/><ref name = "scotland"/>

A final World Cup appearance came in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] in Mexico, at a time when Souness had already been appointed Rangers player-manager.<ref name = "my world cup"/> Souness played in defeats to [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]. He later said he had performed poorly in those matches, having struggled with the high altitude and losing a significant amount of weight and power.<ref name = "my world cup"/> Souness was omitted by caretaker manager [[Alex Ferguson]] for Scotland's final match against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]].<ref name = "my world cup">{{cite news |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/worldcup2010/my_world_cup/8230273.My_World_Cup__Graeme_Souness__1978__1982__1986_/ |title=My World Cup: Graeme Souness (1978, 1982, 1986) |work=Lancashire Telegraph |date=21 June 2010 |access-date=4 October 2015}}</ref> Souness claimed in his autobiography, ''The Management Years'', and press interviews that this was the only time in his whole career he had been dropped.<ref name = "my world cup"/> Souness also stated Ferguson was unusually apologetic and was very respectful and diplomatic in his conversation with Souness at night when he broke the news to him, as he held Souness in high regard.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book|title=Souness: The Management Years: Amazon.co.uk: David Murray, Graeme Souness, Mike Ellis: Books |id={{ASIN|0233997385|country=uk}} }}</ref> His international career ended after the 1986 World Cup.<ref name = "my world cup"/> He had made 54 appearances in almost 12 years, scoring four goals.<ref name = "scotland"/>

==Coaching and managerial career==

===Rangers===
Souness was appointed Rangers' first player-manager in April 1986, signing from Sampdoria for a fee of £300,000 and succeeding [[Jock Wallace]].<ref name="revolution"/> Financed initially by the club's then owner, Lawrence Marlborough, Souness and club chairman [[David Holmes (businessman)|David Holmes]] embarked upon a bold strategy of reclaiming the footballing ascendancy Rangers had lacked in recent years, having not won the league title since 1978, with all of the Scottish league titles since then being claimed by their arch-rivals Celtic, and the emerging [[New Firm (Scotland)|"New Firm"]] of [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]]. A 33-year-old Souness arrived at Ibrox with a reputation as one of Europe's leading midfielders. His signing was unusual in that Scottish clubs had rarely been able to sign top-quality internationals, including Scots, from other leagues. Scottish clubs had often found themselves being in the position of selling their top players to English clubs, notable examples being [[Kenny Dalglish]] (sold from Celtic to Liverpool in 1977), [[Gordon Strachan]] (sold from [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 1984) and [[Frank McAvennie]] (sold from St Mirren to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in 1985).<ref name="revolution"/>

A string of major signings for Rangers from English clubs began to be termed the "Souness Revolution". Significantly, this reversed the historic pattern of Scotland's most able footballers playing in England. His first signings included [[Terry Butcher]], captain of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and an established [[England national football team|England international]], and [[Chris Woods]] of [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], England's second-choice goalkeeper. Subsequent seasons saw the arrival of other English internationals, such as [[Trevor Steven]], [[Gary Stevens (footballer, born 1963)|Gary Stevens]], [[Trevor Francis]] and [[Ray Wilkins]]. Souness was able to offer the lure of European club competition, at a time – 1985–1990 – when English clubs were banned from Europe in the wake of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Rangers profited from this by embarking upon a signing policy which drew on their relative wealth to compete, for the first time, directly with England's most powerful clubs.

Souness revitalised Rangers quickly began to dominate Scottish football. In his first season, [[1986–87 in Scottish football|1986–87]], they won the Championship and the League Cup, defeating Celtic 2–1 in the final. They retained the League Cup in 1987–88, defeating Aberdeen on penalties after extra-time, although they surrendered their league title to Celtic.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19871026&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald |date=26 October 1987 |page=9 |title=Spot-on Rangers earn the cheers |first=Jim |last=Reynolds |access-date=21 October 2017}}</ref> Two more Championships were to follow, this time in successive seasons ([[1988–89 in Scottish football|1988–89]] and [[1989–90 in Scottish football|1989–90]]), and a further two League Cup victories, over Aberdeen 3–2 in 1988–89 and Celtic 2–1 (after extra time) in [[1990–91 in Scottish football|1990–91]].<ref>{{cite news|title=1990/91 - Rangers 2-1 Celtic (aet)|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/7943599.stm|work=BBC Sport|access-date=9 December 2018}}</ref> In April 1991, Rangers were in the process of winning a fourth league title in five seasons when Souness left Rangers to take over as manager of Liverpool. He was replaced by his assistant [[Walter Smith]] four matches prior to the end of what was to become another championship-winning season. Rangers went on to win six further league titles in succession, as well as a string of domestic cups, under Smith's management.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/13030001.FLASHBACK__1991_______Mark_Walters_and_Scott_Booth_recall_their_part_in_Smith___s_maiden_final_day_triumph_walters_BOOTH/|title=Flashback: 1991, Mark Walters and Scott Booth recall their part in Smith's maiden final-day triumph|date=14 May 2011|access-date=21 October 2017|newspaper=[[The Herald (Scotland)|The Herald]]}}</ref>

Although Souness had been hugely successful in his time at [[Ibrox, Glasgow|Ibrox]], his time in charge had not been without controversy. A significant act was the signing of [[Mo Johnston]] in 1989. Rangers, historically a team supported by [[Protestant]]s, had for most of the 20th century [[Rangers F.C. signing policy|a policy]] of refusing to sign [[Roman Catholic]]s. Although there had been many Rangers players of Catholic faith, particularly before the [[sectarianism in Glasgow|sectarian divisions]] hardened after World War I, none of them were as high-profile as Johnston. He had previously played for Celtic, and had looked set to rejoin them from [[FC Nantes|Nantes]] until Souness made an offer to sign him.<ref name = "emotions">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/jul/10/maurice-mo-johnston-rangers-celtic |title=Why Mo Johnston still stirs emotions across Glasgow |first=Ewan |last=Murray |work=The Guardian |date=10 July 2009 |access-date=29 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rangers.co.uk/club/history/club-history/item/507-the-souness-revolution |title=The Souness Revolution |work=www.rangers.co.uk |publisher=Rangers FC |access-date=4 October 2015 |quote=They [David Murray and Graeme Souness] also did something which had not happened at Rangers for more than 70 years.

Souness also found himself under scrutiny from the [[Scottish Football Association]] (SFA) and [[Scottish League]] more than once. A succession of confrontational after-match comments pitched Souness regularly at loggerheads with both organisations, prompting touchline bans which Souness circumvented in characteristically provocative fashion by naming himself as a substitute, allowing access as a player to the [[Dugout (football)|dugout]]. In May 1990, Souness was fined £5,000 by the SFA for breaching a touchline ban after television pictures showed him in the tunnel area yelling at his players on the pitch.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8mJPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bZADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5560,2806099&dq=souness+tunnel&hl=en New Straits Times – Google News Archive Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Souness later said that conflict with officialdom was one of the principal factors precipitating his departure from Ibrox.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/stephen-halliday-six-game-ban-unfair-try-a-two-year-stint-for-size-1-1497967 |title=Stephen Halliday: Six-game ban unfair?

In 2009, Souness said of his time as Rangers manager, "When I look back on my actions and antics at Ibrox I bordered on being out of order. I was obnoxious and difficult to deal with."<ref>{{cite web|author=Hugh Keevins |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/graeme-souness-sfa-snub-means-1033197 |title=Graeme Souness: SFA snub means I'll never work in management again |work=Daily Record |date=8 August 2009 |access-date=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110195936/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/graeme-souness-sfa-snub-means-1033197 |archive-date=10 November 2013 }}</ref> He was manager during 261 matches in all competitions for Rangers, winning 125 (64%) of 193 league fixtures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/rangers/manager.php?id=109 |title=Rangers manager Graeme Souness|publisher=Fitbastats.com|access-date=16 April 2017}}</ref>

===Liverpool===
[[Kenny Dalglish]], who had played alongside Souness at Liverpool, had resigned as Liverpool manager in February 1991, despite having won three league titles and two FA Cups in the previous five seasons, and with Liverpool still being in contention for both trophies when he resigned.<ref name = "dalglish resigns">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/23/newsstory.sport12 |first=Ian |last=Rush |work=The Guardian |title=22.02.1991 Kenny Dalglish resigns as Liverpool manager |date=23 February 2008 |access-date=8 November 2015}}</ref> Long-serving coach [[Ronnie Moran]] was put in temporary charge following Dalglish's sudden resignation, but he did not want the job permanently.<ref name = "dalglish resigns"/> Souness was appointed Liverpool manager, having signed a five-year contract, on 16 April 1991,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-doubts-mount-over-souness-future-at-anfield-liverpool-manager-continuing-normal-duties-as-directors-meet-again-while-a-former-favourite-and-potential-replacement-criticises-board-2321094.html |title=Football: Doubts mount over Souness' future at Anfield: Liverpool manager 'continuing normal duties' as directors meet again while a former favourite and potential replacement criticises board |first=Phil |last=Shaw |work=The Independent |date=5 May 1993 |access-date=6 August 2014}}</ref> leaving Rangers with four games of their season remaining.<ref name=opengoal>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxYnPCuQeYg "MARK HATELEY | Open Goal Meets... Former Rangers, England, AC Milan & Monaco Striker"] – Open Goal, [[YouTube]], 29 November 2021</ref>

Souness took over at Anfield just before Liverpool surrendered their defence of the English league title to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. He made a major reorganisation of the squad in his first six months as manager, bringing in [[Dean Saunders]] for an English record of £2.9&nbsp;million as well as defenders [[Mark Wright (footballer, born 1963)|Mark Wright]] and [[Rob Jones (footballer, born 1971)|Rob Jones]] and midfielder [[Mark Walters]]. He also gave a regular place in the team to 19-year-old midfielder [[Steve McManaman]], whose debut had come under Dalglish in December 1990, and a debut to one of Dalglish's last signings, teenage midfielder [[Jamie Redknapp]]. At the end of that campaign, Souness gave a professional contract to 17-year-old striker [[Robbie Fowler]].

During the [[1991–92 Liverpool F.C. season|1991–92 season]], Liverpool rarely looked like serious title contenders, and it soon became a two-horse race between [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Leeds eventually won the title, while Liverpool came sixth. They returned to European competition that season after six years of isolation following the [[Heysel disaster]] of 1985, and reached the [[1991–92 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup quarter-finals]], where they were eliminated by [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]]. By April 1992, they were only in contention for the FA Cup.

Souness had major [[heart surgery]] in April 1992. A controversy arose after the [[1991–92 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-final against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], which Liverpool needed a replay and penalties to win. In the event of a victory for Liverpool, an interview was due to be published in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|the Sun]]'', a British tabloid, with Souness celebrating the win and his own successful surgery.<ref name = "lfc profile">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/profile-tougher-than-his-old-boots-graeme-souness-still-managing-liverpool-1480208.html |title=Profile: Tougher than his old boots: Graeme Souness, still managing Liverpool |work=The Independent |date=23 January 1993 |access-date=4 October 2015}}</ref> The photograph which accompanied the interview was of Souness, in his hospital ward, kissing his girlfriend with joy at his own recovery and his team's win.<ref name = "lfc profile"/> The interview was due to go in alongside the match report on 14 April 1992, but the late end to the game meant the deadline for publication was missed and the report, with interview and photograph, went in on 15 April instead – the third anniversary of the [[Hillsborough disaster]].<ref name = "lfc profile"/> Many Liverpool fans reacted with fury after seeing the interview was conducted with ''The Sun'', a newspaper which had been reviled and widely shunned on [[Merseyside]] following its [[Hillsborough disaster and The Sun|false reporting]] on the disaster.<ref name = "lfc profile"/> Souness himself had restricted Liverpool players from talking to ''The Sun''.<ref name = "lfc profile"/> Although he apologised at the time, Souness has since said that he probably should have resigned at that point. There were continued calls from many fans for Souness to resign or be sacked.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}} Souness attended the [[1992 FA Cup Final]], which Liverpool won 2–0 against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], against the advice of his doctors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/18/seven-deadly-sins-football-liverpool-souness-mcmanaman |title=Souness's Cup final recovery - Wembley, 1992 |first=Steve |last=McManaman |work=The Guardian |date=18 May 2009 |access-date=13 December 2016}}</ref>

[[1992–93 in English football|1992–93]] was an even more frustrating season for Souness. Just after the start of the season, he sold [[Dean Saunders]] to Aston Villa. While Saunders was a key player in Villa's near-successful title challenge, his successor [[Paul Stewart (footballer, born 1964)|Paul Stewart]] proved to be a huge disappointment, scoring just one league goal from 32 appearances over the next two seasons, struggling with injuries as well as inconsistent form. Top scorer [[Ian Rush]] was having a difficult time scoring goals, and Liverpool spent much of the season in the bottom half of the table. They entered March still only in 15th place, but an excellent final quarter of the season, in which Rush scored 11 Premier League goals, saw them finish sixth. This time there was no success in any of the cup competitions, meaning that there would be no European competition for Liverpool in the 1993–94 season. Aside from the six seasons when Liverpool were banned from European competitions, this was the first time since 1963 that Liverpool had failed to qualify for Europe.{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

The pressure on Souness continued to mount throughout 1993, but he made another attempt at revitalising Liverpool by signing defender [[Julian Dicks]] and striker [[Nigel Clough]] for the [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94 season]]. The season began well, but the disappointing results quickly returned. Souness finally resigned as Liverpool manager at the end of January 1994 when Liverpool had suffered a shock [[1993–94 FA Cup|FA Cup]] exit at the hands of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. He was succeeded by long-serving coach [[Roy Evans]].

Souness's three-year reign as Liverpool manager was not remembered with fondness by the club's fans, although his reign did bring some success to the club. Apart from guiding them to FA Cup success in 1992, he also oversaw the breakthrough of three young players who would go on to be a key part in Liverpool's improved performances over the next five years – Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler and [[Jamie Redknapp]], allowing them to play and develop in the first team where they went on to inspire an upturn in fortunes at [[Anfield]].

Souness later said in his autobiography ''The Management Years'' that he faced an uphill struggle from the start for a number of reasons. The majority of key players were in their late 20s or early 30s when he took over, and some appeared to have passed their peak. He knew they had to be eventually replaced and he doubted the desire of some of them. He said the senior players also appeared not to want to listen to him and may have resented his disciplinarian approach to their behaviour, and also claimed a number of players – including [[Peter Beardsley]] and [[Steve McMahon]] – asked for improved terms in their contracts or they would move elsewhere.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In the end, Beardsley, McMahon and Houghton were sold, seemingly before suitable replacements were found and these key components of Kenny Dalglish's great side were not adequately replaced. Souness said Ian Rush and Ray Houghton had also questioned why new signings like Mark Wright were earning more money than them, despite not yet having won any trophies.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>{{page needed|date=June 2024}} The sale of Peter Beardsley to local rivals [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] was a controversial move, and the player performed well for Everton in his two seasons there, and continued to do well despite his advancing years during four seasons at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].{{citation needed|date=June 2024}}

Souness also claims Liverpool chief executive Peter Robinson at the time had warned him this was a Liverpool team in decline and that they only had one player who was still "great" - [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]]. Souness was left disappointed by Barnes as he was at this time frequently suffering from injuries, and in particular suffered a ruptured achilles tendon which was to eventually affect his acceleration therefore affecting his playing style, and not giving Souness what he wanted from a vintage Barnes at his peak, which was what he saw as a "devastating winger with pace and goalscoring touch". He had also said Barnes was once the "best player in Britain" but unfortunately only saw flashes of his brilliance.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Souness also fell out with former Liverpool teammates [[Tommy Smith (footballer, born 1945)|Tommy Smith]] and Phil Thompson during his time in charge at Anfield. In his autobiography, Souness said that Thompson, the reserve team manager, was overheard angrily criticising his tactics and purchases behind his back. This was overheard by Manchester United assistant manager [[Brian Kidd]] and relayed to [[Walter Smith]], who was so alarmed by Thompson's behaviour that he drove from Scotland to Liverpool to tell Souness what had been said. Souness dismissed Thompson as a result and the two have remained bitter towards each other since, with Thompson claiming in his own book he would never speak to Souness again as a result.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Souness said he had a number of disputes as a Liverpool player with Thompson, including in 1981, when Thompson initially refused to speak to Souness for a while after he lost the captaincy to him; Thompson had accused Souness to his face and in front of the other Liverpool players of "stealing the captaincy behind his back". They also had an argument and physical fight which took place after Thompson had accused Souness of marrying his first wife Danielle only because she was wealthy. Souness believed these incidents may have contributed to Thompson's hostility and disrespect of him.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Tommy Smith had been strongly critical of Souness in the local media at the time, and he had been caught mixing with the players and some of the coaches at Anfield despite no longer having an official position at the club. Souness banned Smith from the club areas, and said that in his last phone call with Smith, instructing him not to be seen around the official club areas, he was certain he had "made an enemy for life".<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Galatasaray===
After leaving Liverpool, Souness was out of work for over a year, despite reports at the end of the [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94 season]] linking him with a return to Middlesbrough, this time as a manager, a job which went to [[Bryan Robson]] instead.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-lawrence-leaves-middlesbrough-1433290.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Phil | last=Shaw | title=Football: Lawrence leaves Middlesbrough | date=3 May 1994}}</ref>

Souness went to manage [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in Turkey in June 1995, and again managed to court controversy with local issues, nearly sparking a riot after placing a large Galatasaray flag into the centre circle of the pitch of arch rivals [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football)|Fenerbahçe]] after Galatasaray had beaten them in the [[Turkish Cup]] final on 24 April 1996. The iconic image of Souness planting the flag drew comparisons with Turkish hero [[Ulubatlı Hasan]], who was killed as he planted the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] flag at the end of the [[Siege of Constantinople]]. This earned Souness the nickname "Ulubatlı Souness".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ulubatli Souness (In Turkish) |publisher=cimbombom.8k.com |url=http://www.cimbombom.8k.com/ulubatli.html |access-date=19 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622184920/http://www.cimbombom.8k.com/ulubatli.html |archive-date=22 June 2007 }}</ref>

===Southampton===
Souness then returned to England to manage [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], but after one season he resigned, citing differences with chairman [[Rupert Lowe]]. Souness is perhaps best remembered at Southampton for signing Senegalese player [[Ali Dia (footballer)|Ali Dia]], supposedly on the recommendation of former [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] and former [[Liberia national football team|Liberian]] [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[George Weah]]. Souness did not check any of Dia's credentials as a good player, which proved to be a hoax instigated by Dia's friend (who had made the initial call). When Dia made his sole appearance in the Premier League, as a substitute for [[Matt Le Tissier]], he performed amazingly poorly and was substituted. A notable high point of the season was a 6–3 home win over defending champions [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in late October.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last= Holley |first= Duncan |author2= Chalk, Gary | publisher=Hagiology Publishing | year=2003 | isbn=0-9534474-3-X|pages=248 & 504}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2008/nov/22/southampton-championship|title=The one-off who played for Southampton|work=Guardian |date=22 November 2008|access-date=3 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://journaloffailure.wordpress.com/2013/10/15/the-legend-of-ali-dia/ |title=The Journal of Failure |work=The Legend of Ali Dia |access-date=24 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212085820/http://journaloffailure.wordpress.com/2013/10/15/the-legend-of-ali-dia/ |archive-date=12 December 2013}}</ref>

The ''Saints'' managed to avoid relegation from the Premier League in 1996–97, finishing 16th, but he resigned towards the end of May 1997. Within days, it was reported Everton, Liverpool's [[Merseyside derby|local rivals]], were interested in appointing Souness as manager to succeed [[Joe Royle]], but [[Howard Kendall]] was appointed for a third time instead.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Ian |title=Royle vacates Everton throne |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/royle-vacates-everton-throne-1.56739 |access-date=27 August 2020 |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=28 March 1997}}</ref>

===Torino===
After his stint at Southampton, Souness went back to Italy to become the coach at [[Torino F.C.|Torino]]. When he arrived, it was clear he would have no say in what players he could buy or sell, as the club's owner made those decisions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Souness lasted just four months before being dismissed.

===Benfica===
In November 1997, Souness was appointed by [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]'s new chairman [[João Vale e Azevedo]], who promised to return the club to its former glory. The Scottish manager brought several British players from the Premier League, including defenders [[Steve Harkness]] and [[Gary Charles]], midfielders [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] and [[Mark Pembridge]] and forwards [[Dean Saunders]] and [[Brian Deane]], as well as refusing to sign emerging talent [[Deco]]. 18 months later, Souness left the club and stated, "Vale e Azevedo lies when he looks in the eyes. Be careful, this man is dangerous."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/quando-moller-nielsen-ficou-as-portas-do-benfica|title=A noite em que Möller-Nielsen ficou às portas do Benfica|last=Madureira|first=Nuno|date=14 February 2014|website=Maisfutebol|language=pt|trans-title=The night that Möller-Nielsen almost joined Benfica|access-date=10 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Donn|first=Natasha|date=12 July 2019|title=Vale e Azevedo tries to officially dodge 10-year jail term for embezzlement of Benfica's millions|url=https://www.portugalresident.com/2019/07/12/vale-e-azevedo-tries-to-officially-dodge-10-year-jail-term-for-embezzlement-of-benficas-millions/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190912160109/https://www.portugalresident.com/2019/07/12/vale-e-azevedo-tries-to-officially-dodge-10-year-jail-term-for-embezzlement-of-benficas-millions/|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 September 2019|work=Portugal Resident|access-date=12 September 2019}}</ref>

===Blackburn Rovers===
Souness returned to the English league in March 2000 to become manager of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], earning promotion back to the Premier League in his first full season. During his four-year spell at Blackburn, he initially got the very best out of talented youngsters such as [[Damien Duff]], [[David Dunn]] and [[Matt Jansen]], as well as bringing [[Henning Berg]] back to the club and signing big name players like [[Andy Cole]], [[Tugay Kerimoğlu]], [[Barry Ferguson]], [[Brad Friedel]] and [[Dwight Yorke]]. Cole and Jansen scored in Blackburn's 2–1 League Cup final victory over Tottenham Hotspur in February 2002. Blackburn were still battling against relegation back to Division One when they lifted the League Cup, but went on to finish a secure 10th in the final table.

Souness then guided Blackburn to a sixth-place finish in 2003 and took them into the [[UEFA Cup]] for a second successive season, before finishing a disappointing 15th in [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]].

===Newcastle United===
Souness left Blackburn in September 2004 to become manager of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] following the sacking of 71-year-old [[Bobby Robson|Sir Bobby Robson]] a few games into the season.<ref>{{cite news |title=Souness takes Newcastle job |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/3630952.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=6 September 2004 |access-date=3 April 2012}}</ref>

Despite a promising start on [[Tyneside]], Souness quickly fell out with a number of players, including [[Wales national football team|Welsh international]] [[Craig Bellamy]], who left the club to join Blackburn, after being loaned out to Celtic. [[Laurent Robert]], [[Olivier Bernard]] and [[Jermaine Jenas]] were also reported to have left the club on bad terms with Souness. The club finished 14th in the league (their lowest finish since promotion in 1993) and despite making it to the quarter-finals of the [[2004–05 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] and the semi-finals of the [[2004–05 FA Cup|FA Cup]], Souness found himself under mounting pressure from ''Toon'' supporters.

Newcastle had a slow start to the [[2005–06 Newcastle United F.C. season|2005–06 season]], but Souness was hoping that the purchase of [[Michael Owen]] from Real Madrid on 30 August for an estimated club-record fee of £17&nbsp;million would help to turn the club's fortunes around and bring a repeat of the top five finishes achieved during Robson's final three seasons. Newcastle recorded a win in the [[Tyne-Wear derby]] against Sunderland (3–2), and went on to win their next three matches, keeping three clean sheets. Souness seemed to be tightening up Newcastle in defence, with six clean sheets in Newcastle's first 12 games of the season, as many as the whole of the preceding campaign. His decision to reunite the former England striker duo [[Alan Shearer]] and Michael Owen initially appeared shrewd. However, Owen cracked the fifth metatarsal of his right foot when he clashed with England teammate [[Paul Robinson (footballer, born 1979)|Paul Robinson]] during a 2–0 defeat at Tottenham on 30 December 2005 and was out of action for three months, adding to the club's injury woes.

Souness was criticised for an apparent lack of long-term planning at Newcastle, centred on a small squad, and a consequent vulnerability to injury among his players. Expensive signings – such as [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] for £8&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite news |title=Magpies complete Boumsong signing |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/4119197.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=2 January 2005 |access-date=3 April 2012}}</ref> and [[Albert Luque]] for £10&nbsp;million – failed to live up to expectations. By the beginning of February 2006, Newcastle United were placed 15th in the Premier League table and sliding dangerously towards a relegation battle, despite having spent over £50million on players in the last 18 months. On 2 February 2006, Souness was sacked as manager by chairman [[Freddy Shepherd]] and replaced by United's Youth Academy Director [[Glenn Roeder]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/feb/02/newsstory.sport13 |title=Newcastle sack Souness |work=The Guardian |date=2 February 2006 |access-date=26 February 2019}}</ref>

In the club's DVD season review for the 2005–06 season, goalkeeper [[Shay Given]] and defender [[Robbie Elliott]] acknowledged Souness was under pressure at the club as a result of injuries to the squad and admitted some players were to blame for their lack of all-round effort, but also admitted there was a bad atmosphere at the training ground, with Souness seeming to favour some players over others. Alan Shearer acknowledged the fans never really accepted Souness, as well as several injuries being instrumental in damaging the team's confidence. Chairman Freddy Shepherd declared it was the team's formation and loss against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] that prompted his decision to sack Souness.<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000FA578K Newcastle United – Season Review 2005/2006 on www.amazon.co.uk]</ref>

Souness did not return to football management after leaving Newcastle.

===Stevens inquiry===
{{overly detailed|section|date=June 2024}}
In the report of the [[2006 allegations of corruption in English football#Stevens report|Stevens inquiry]] into football corruption published in June 2007, Souness was criticised for an apparent lack of consistency:{{cquote|There remains inconsistencies in evidence provided by Graeme Souness – a former manager of the club – and [[Kenneth Shepherd]] – apparently acting in an undefined role but not as a club official – as to their respective roles in transfer negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|title=What Stevens said about each club |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=16 June 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=A1YourView&xml=/sport/2007/06/16/sfnste116.xml |access-date=17 June 2007 |location=London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228065435/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS |archive-date=28 December 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/15/newsstory.boltonwanderers|title=Stevens names and shames 17 transfers in bungs inquiry|first=James|last=Dart|newspaper=Guardian|date=15 June 2007|access-date=6 August 2014}}</ref>}}Souness issued a statement denying any wrongdoing:{{cquote|"I cannot understand why my name features in this report.

When Boumsong was given a torrid time by [[DJ Campbell]] during his Newcastle debut against [[Yeading F.C.|Yeading]] in the FA Cup, doubts over the wisdom of the transfer mushroomed.<ref name = "Newcastle relaxed"/> The agent in the Boumsong and Faye transfers was [[Willie McKay]]. On 7 November 2007, Quest issued the following statement about McKay's dealings:{{cquote|Further to the key findings from the final Quest report published on 15 June 2007 by the Premier League, Quest would like to emphasise that, in that report, it was clear that no evidence of irregular payments was found in the transfers in the inquiry period which involved the agent Willie McKay.

==Career after management==

===Media work===
Souness has appeared as a television analyst in the UK and Ireland regularly since his managerial career ended. He was one of the main analysts on [[Sky Sports]] coverage of the [[Premier League]], regularly appearing on the ''[[Super Sunday (British TV programme)|Super Sunday]]'' programme featuring the biggest head-to-head matches, and was one of the main pundits used on their [[UEFA Champions League]] coverage until they lost the rights in 2015. He left Sky Sports on 30 April 2023.

Souness previously featured on [[RTÉ]]'s live coverage of the UEFA Champions League and on their highlights show ''[[Premier Soccer Saturday]]'', covering the Premier League. He was also regularly seen covering RTÉ's coverage of Republic of Ireland football internationals. Souness contributed to [[RTÉ Sport]]'s coverage of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], alongside [[Johnny Giles]], [[Eamon Dunphy]], [[Liam Brady]], [[Ronnie Whelan]], [[Denis Irwin]], [[Ossie Ardiles]] and [[Dietmar Hamann]] for the duration of the group stage.<ref>{{cite news| author=Black, Fergus | url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/rte-hopes-ossie-and-squad-will-spur-fans-to-back-home-team-2203365.html | work=[[Irish Independent]] | title=RTÉ hopes Ossie and squad will spur fans to back home team | date=2 June 2010 | access-date=2 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| author=O'Malley, Carl | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2010/0602/1224271676683.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021053654/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2010/0602/1224271676683.html |archive-date=21 October 2012 | newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] | title=RTÉ roll out big guns for their 56 live games | date=2 June 2010 | access-date=2 June 2010}}</ref>

During analysis of the World Cup match between [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] on 13 June 2010, Souness made a controversial comment involving [[Nemanja Vidić]] and [[Fernando Torres]] live on air, commenting, "Vidic got raped... sorry, taken apart by Torres at Liverpool", which forced RTÉ to censure Souness and publicly apologise after a commercial break.<ref>[http://www.dangerhere.com/souness-rape-gaffe-forces-rte-into-world-cup-apology/ Souness rape gaffe forces RTE into apology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619124127/http://www.dangerhere.com/souness-rape-gaffe-forces-rte-into-world-cup-apology/ |date=19 June 2010 }}.</ref><ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=graeme+souness+rape&btnG=Google+Search&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai= Graeme Souness World Cup controversial]</ref>

As a pundit, Souness is also known for his frequent criticism of [[Paul Pogba]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Feliciano|first=Daniel|date=2021-08-15|title=Graeme Souness refuses to praise Paul Pogba for Man United display vs Leeds|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/souness-paul-pogba-manchester-united-21316803|access-date=2021-09-14|website=Manchester Evening News|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Reporter|first=Metro Sport|date=2020-04-27|title=Rio Ferdinand slams Graeme Souness over 'get your medals out' dig at Paul Pogba|url=https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/27/rio-ferdinand-hits-graeme-souness-criticism-paul-pogba-defends-manchester-united-star-12616302/|access-date=2021-09-14|website=Metro|language=en}}</ref> Pogba himself is unaware what he has done to warrant such criticism. Instead, he affirms he has no idea of Souness' existence.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-04-14|title=Paul Pogba: 'I don't even know who Graeme Souness is'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/14/paul-pogba-graeme-souness-manchester-united-criticism|access-date=2021-09-14|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

===Possible returns to management===
In June 2006, the chairman of [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Simon Jordan]], said he wished to discuss with Souness a role in managing the club following the departure of [[Iain Dowie]].<ref>{{cite news |url= https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/5040426.stm |title=Jordan targets Souness for boss|work =BBC Sport | date=2 June 2006 | access-date=3 October 2008}}</ref> However, no contract materialised.

Souness looked to be the front-runner for the [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] manager's job following the departure of his former Liverpool teammate [[Sammy Lee (footballer)|Sammy Lee]] in October 2007, but later pulled out of the running when it became apparent the job was set to be given to [[Gary Megson]].<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/24/sport.sport1 |title=Bolton again train sights on Megson after Souness snub|work =The Guardian |author=Louise Taylor|date=24 October 2007 |access-date=4 February 2009 | location=London}}</ref> At around the same time, Souness was linked with taking over the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7066392.stm | work=BBC Sport | title=Souness interested in Ireland job | date=28 October 2007}}</ref>

In January 2008, Souness announced he would be willing to return to Newcastle United as manager, following the departure of [[Sam Allardyce]] and the arrival of the club's new ownership and board. However, United only interviewed [[Harry Redknapp]] and [[Kevin Keegan]] for the position, with Keegan soon after being appointed with the job; Souness's interest has never been publicly acknowledged by the club.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/13012008/4/souness-keen-newcastle-return.html|title=Souness Keen on Newcastle Return|publisher =Yahoo!

Following the sacking of Blackburn Rovers manager [[Paul Ince]] on 16 December 2008, Souness was linked with a return to the club as manager.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/blackburn_rovers/7786228.stm |title=Rovers target quick appointment|work =BBC Sport|date=16 December 2008 |access-date=16 December 2008}}</ref> However, Sam Allardyce was appointed as the new manager on 17 December, after Souness said he had no contact from Blackburn about the position.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/blackburn_rovers/7787940.stm | title=Allardyce named Blackburn manager | work=BBC Sport | date = 18 December 2008 | access-date=18 December 2008}}</ref>

Having been linked with the Scotland national team in November 2009, Souness stated he has no desire to return to management at any level.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8402689.stm | title=Petrescu to discuss Scotland job | work=BBC Sport | date = 8 December 2009 | access-date=8 December 2009 | first1=Chick | last1=Young | first2=Kheredine | last2=Idessane}}</ref>

===Bid for Wolverhampton Wanderers===
In January 2007, it was reported by the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' that Souness was heading a £20&nbsp;million consortium to take over [[EFL Championship|Football League Championship]] club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. He attended a Wolves game as a VIP guest and made a formal offer for the club, asking to see the club's finances. The bid was rejected by the Wolves board, which felt it undervalued the club.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/6244319.stm|title=Souness makes written Wolves bid|work =BBC Sport|date=10 January 2007 |access-date=11 May 2007}}</ref> Souness did not make a repeat offer for the club and it was later sold to another investor.

==Biographies==
In 1985, Souness wrote an autobiography called ''No Half Measures''. In 1999, he wrote another book chronicling his post-playing career up to and including his spell at Southampton, entitled ''Souness: The Management Years''.

==Life outside football==

===Personal life===
Souness' first wife was Danielle Wilson; they met in 1982 and married in 1984. He adopted her young daughter, and they had three more children together. They separated in 1989 and later divorced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23494183-matches-of-the-day-how-footballing-marriages-of-yesterday-compare-to-coleen-and-waynes-lavish-nuptials.do |title=Matches of the Day: How footballing marriages of yesterday compare to Coleen and Wayne's lavish nuptials |work=Evening Standard |location=London, UK |date=11 June 2008 |access-date=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826223942/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23494183-matches-of-the-day-how-footballing-marriages-of-yesterday-compare-to-coleen-and-waynes-lavish-nuptials.do |archive-date=26 August 2011}}</ref>

Souness has been married to Karen Souness, his second wife, since 1994. Together, the couple have a son and Souness has two stepchildren from Karen's previous relationship.<ref>{{cite web|title=The softer side of Toon's hardman |work=icnetwork.co.uk |date=4 November 2004 |url=http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/newcastleunited/news/tm_objectid=14834442&method=full&siteid=50081&headline=the-softer-side-of-toon-s-hardman-name_page.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514175400/http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/newcastleunited/news/tm_objectid%3D14834442%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D50081%26headline%3Dthe-softer-side-of-toon-s-hardman-name_page.html |archive-date=14 May 2012 |access-date=19 June 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2010, Souness sold the family home in [[Colinton]] in Edinburgh for £3.5m to [[Fred Goodwin]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cramb |first1=Auslan |title=Sir Fred Goodwin buys £3.5m property in Edinburgh |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/constructionandproperty/7815617/Sir-Fred-Goodwin-buys-3.5m-property-in-Edinburgh.html |access-date=27 August 2020 |work=The Telegraph |date=9 June 2010}}</ref> and moved to a newly developed property in [[Sandbanks]], [[Poole]], Dorset.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Milmo |first1=Cahal |title=Sandbanks: The millionaires' seaside haven spoiled by booze, strippers and naked butlers |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sandbanks-the-millionaires-seaside-haven-spoiled-by-booze-strippers-and-naked-butlers-9247032.html |access-date=27 August 2020 |work=The Independent |date=8 April 2014}}</ref>

During a discussion about climate change on [[Sky Sports]] ''Super Sunday'' in 2021, Souness announced that he had been following a [[veganism|vegan]] diet for the previous three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.caughtoffside.com/2021/09/19/sky-sports-pundit-graeme-souness-shocks-everyone-with-his-diet/|date=19 September 2021 |title=Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness shocks everyone with his diet|first=Tony|last=Robertson|website=Caught Offside|access-date=20 September 2021}}</ref>

===Political views===
Souness' political views have, at various points in his career, generated comment.

In 1982, Souness and teammate Sammy Lee made cameo appearances, as themselves, in an episode of the [[BBC]]'s Liverpudlian drama series ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. Written by [[Alan Bleasdale]], the series offered a critique of [[Thatcherism]] – and in particular the large-scale unemployment then evident in urban Britain – apparently at odds with Souness's own [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politics.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://jss.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/26/1/6|title=Long Distance Love: Growing Up a Liverpool Football Club Fan|author=Grant Farred|journal =Journal of Sport & Social Issues|volume=26|year=2002|access-date=11 May 2007}}</ref>

In 2007, in the lead-up to elections to the [[Scottish Parliament]], Souness was one of 15 prominent current and former footballers named in a newspaper advertisement urging "every patriotic Scot to help maintain Scotland's place in the United Kingdom which has served Scotland well."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/apr/23/scotland.devolution1|title=Scottish football stars urge voters to reject independence call|work =[[The Guardian]]|date=23 April 2007|access-date=11 May 2007 | location=London | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref>

Prior to the [[2025 Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election]] to the [[Scottish Parliament]], in which [[Reform UK]] was expected to contend for victory, Souness blasted Reform leader [[Nigel Farage]] as a "chancer" who "doesn't care about [Scots]," encouraging voters to choose the Labour candidate and eventual winner, [[Davy Russell (politician)|Davy Russell]].<ref>{{Cite web | title=Graeme Souness rips into 'chancer' Farage as he backs Labour in Hamilton by-election - Daily Record | url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/graeme-souness-tears-chancer-nigel-35336405 | access-date=2025-08-22 | website=www.dailyrecord.co.uk | date=4 June 2025 }}</ref>

===Charitable work===
Souness launched a fundraising campaign for [[DEBRA]], a charity seeking a cure for [[epidermolysis bullosa]], in May 2023.<ref name = debra>{{cite web |url=https://news.stv.tv/scotland/scottish-football-legend-graeme-souness-set-to-swim-english-channel |title=Scots football legend Graeme Souness set to swim English Channel |website=STV News |first=Vidushi |last=Tiwari |date=22 May 2023 |accessdate=22 May 2023}}</ref> As part of the fundraising activities he announced plans to swim the [[English Channel]].<ref name = debra/> On 18 June 2023, he completed the swim, in a wetsuit, as part of a six-person relay team, raising £1m for the charity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-65944866 |title=Graeme Souness: Football legend swims Channel for £1m fundraiser |website=BBC News |date=18 June 2023 |accessdate=18 June 2023}}</ref>

===Reputation===

Souness was described by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as "one of the most fearsome men in the game."<ref name="mullin"/> However, his Liverpool team-mate [[Michael Robinson (footballer)|Michael Robinson]] said of Souness in 2016: "I found him a very personal, cuddly chap who was actually quite vulnerable about being a human being with emotions. To this day, he still tries very hard not to be this lovely cuddly person, when really he is."<ref>{{cite web |title=A complete chapter from Simon Hughes' book Red Machine: Liverpool FC in the '80s: The Players' Stories |url=https://www.theanfieldwrap.com/2017/07/michael-robinson-red-machine/ |website=The Anfield Wrap |date=12 July 2017 |access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref>
