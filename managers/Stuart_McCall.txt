'''Andrew Stuart Murray McCall''' (born 10 June 1964) is a professional [[association football|football]] coach and former player. He is currently assistant manager of [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].

McCall played in a total of 763&nbsp;league games and in 40 full international matches for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] during his playing career.

McCall started his career with Bradford City, where he made his [[first team (association football)#F|first-team]] debut in 1982. He played six seasons at [[Valley Parade]], during which time he won the [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] championship, a title which was overshadowed by the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] when 56&nbsp;people died and in which his father [[Andy McCall (footballer born 1925)|Andy]] was injured. After missing out on promotion in [[1987–88 in English football|1987–88]], McCall moved to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], for whom he scored twice but finished on the losing side in the [[1989 FA Cup Final]]. In 1991, he moved to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], with whom he spent seven seasons and won five [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|league]] titles, three [[Scottish Cup]]s and two [[Scottish League Cup]]s. McCall returned to Bradford City as captain to take them into the [[Premier League|top division]] of English football for the first time in 77 years. After four seasons he moved to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], where he retired as a player in 2005.

Born and raised in England, McCall qualified to play for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] through his Scottish father. He won 40 international [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scored one goal in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in Italy. He also played in two [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championships]] but his international career ended after he was left out of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] squad.

McCall was part of the coaching staff during his second playing spell at Bradford City, briefly serving as caretaker-player manager in 2000. He continued his coaching at Sheffield United and was assistant manager to [[Neil Warnock]] until May 2007, when he returned to Bradford City as their manager. He spent two and a half seasons in charge of Bradford City, leaving in February 2010. Just before the end of 2010, he was appointed [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] manager. He stayed at [[Fir Park]] for four years, helping the club finish second in the league twice. After a poor start to the 2014–15 season, he resigned in November 2014. McCall was appointed manager of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in March 2015, but left the club at the end of a short-term contract.

McCall returned to Bradford City for a second spell as manager in June 2016. The team reached the play-off final in his first season, but this was lost and he was sacked in February 2018. After a short spell with [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], McCall was appointed Bradford manager for a third time in February 2020.

==Early and personal life==
Stuart McCall was born in [[Leeds]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], England,<ref name=Hugman/> to Scottish parents [[Andy McCall (footballer born 1925)|Andy]], a former professional footballer, and Jean McCall.<ref name="autobio9">{{cite book |last=McCall |first=Stuart |title=The Real McCall |publisher=Mainstream |year=1998 |isbn=1-84018-078-1 |page=9}}</ref> He was the couple's third child after Leslie and Janette, who were 20 and 15 respectively when Stuart was born.<ref name="autobio9"/> The family home was just round the corner from [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]'s [[Elland Road]] ground where McCall would spend many Saturday afternoons watching United, dreaming of following his father and playing for Leeds, even after the family moved to [[Wortley, West Yorkshire|Wortley]].<ref>{{cite book |last=McCall |title=The Real McCall |pages=9–10}}</ref><ref name="leeds">{{cite news |first=Phil |last=Shaw |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/why-leeds-no-longer-have-place-in-mccalls-affections-121655.html |title=Why Leeds no longer have place in McCall's affections |access-date=16 November 2014 |date=7 March 2003 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |archive-date=29 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129133040/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/why-leeds-no-longer-have-place-in-mccalls-affections-121655.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

McCall played football for Upper Wortley Primary School and Thornhill Middle School, even scoring a winning goal for the latter in a cup final when he came on as a substitute with his arm in a sling.<ref>{{cite book |last=McCall |title=The Real McCall |pages=10–11}}</ref> While McCall also played table tennis as a schoolboy, football was a focus, and he captained the Leeds under-11 boys team and played for other Leeds representative sides.<ref name="autobio11-12">{{cite book |last=McCall |title=The Real McCall |pages=11–12}}</ref> 

McCall's parents split and he made up for his size when he moved to one of Leeds' toughest estates and played for pub sides by the age of 14.<ref name="autobio11-12" /> He moved schools to [[The Farnley Academy|Harrington High]] and also played for local young sides Pudsey Juniors, Holbeck and later [[Farsley Celtic A.F.C.|Farsley Celtic]].<ref>{{cite book |last=McCall |title=The Real McCall |pages=14–16}}</ref> McCall thought he had missed his chance of playing professionally after a string of other players were signed by professional clubs, until Farsley played [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]]'s junior side in a friendly and he impressed coach [[Bryan Edwards (footballer, born 1930)|Bryan Edwards]] enough to be asked for a trial.<ref>{{cite book |last=McCall |title=The Real McCall |page=16}}</ref>

His son [[Craig McCall|Craig]] was also a footballer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/sport/18247625.bradford-city-familiar-face-mottley-henry-quick-make-mark/|title=Mottley-Henry's hunger excites McCall|date=20 February 2020|website=Bradford Telegraph and Argus}}</ref>

==Playing career==

===Club career===

====Bradford City====
McCall was signed by [[George Mulhall]] in 1980 from Farsley Celtic on his 16th birthday,<ref name=og>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOR21TgfVOg "Si Ferry Meets...

During the summer of 1984, Cherry made the two key signings of [[Defender (football)|central defender]] [[Dave Evans (footballer)|Dave Evans]] and [[Winger (soccer)|right winger]] [[John Hendrie (Scottish footballer)|John Hendrie]] to build on the previous season's high finish.<ref>{{cite book |last=Markham |title=The legends of Bradford City |page=81}}</ref> McCall was an integral part of the team as City won the Division Three championship in [[1984–85 in English football|1984–85]], during which he scored eight goals as one of two ever-present players.<ref name="markham"/> The title was assured in the penultimate game when McCall scored the second goal in a 2–0 victory over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Frost |title=Bradford City A Complete Record 1903–1988 |page=37}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Frost |title=Bradford City A Complete Record 1903–1988 |page=310}}</ref> The league title was paraded before the final game of the season on 11 May 1985 at home to [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]]. However, the club's title was overshadowed when 56 people died in the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] when the [[Valley Parade]] ground's main stand caught fire after 40 minutes of play, during which McCall's father, who was with other family members, was badly injured.<ref>{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Sutcliffe |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/features/The-horror-a-city-can.1022622.jp |title=The horror a city can never forget |access-date=3 December 2007 |date=11 May 2005 |work=Yorkshire Post}}</ref> After the fire, McCall, still in his kit, spent several hours driving from the ground to his sister's house, then to [[Bradford Royal Infirmary]] and [[Pinderfields General Hospital|Pinderfields Hospital]] trying to find his father.<ref name="autobio tragedy">{{cite book |last=McCall |title=The Real McCall |pages=42–47}}</ref> His father had suffered severe burns and needed skin grafts on his hands and head and was in hospital for several weeks.<ref name="autobio tragedy"/>

For the following 19 months, the club played games away from Valley Parade. Cherry and the players became a close-knit team, attending funerals of the victims and other engagements in the months that followed, and the club's 13th-place finish in [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] in [[1985–86 in English football|1985–86]] was hailed a major achievement.<ref>{{cite book |last=Markham |title=The legends of Bradford City |page=35}}</ref> During Bradford's time away from Valley Parade, McCall also turned his back on Leeds United, the team he had supported as a child, after their fans set fire to a chip van at [[Odsal Stadium]].<ref name="leeds"/> McCall became club captain in November 1986, aged just 21, after [[Peter Jackson (footballer born 1961)|Peter Jackson]] moved to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].<ref name="frost"/> Under Cherry's replacement, [[Terry Dolan (footballer)|Terry Dolan]], the club held off any relegation threats to finish tenth in [[1986–87 in English football|1986–87]]. Like Jackson, McCall and Hendrie were both keen to move to a [[Football League First Division|Division One]] club, but they agreed in 1987 to stay for one final season.<ref name="markham"/>

Dolan brought in [[Paul Tomlinson]], [[Brian Mitchell (footballer)|Brian Mitchell]] and [[Lee Sinnott]] in a bid to help McCall and Hendrie realise their dreams with City.<ref>{{cite book |last=Markham |title=The legends of Bradford City |page=41}}</ref> They mounted a promotion challenge in [[1987–88 in English football|1987–88]] and were top for much of the season until they faltered in the New Year.

McCall was later outspoken in his autobiography, ''The Real McCall'', about City's failure to strengthen the side to secure promotion.<ref name="payment">{{cite news |url = http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/1998/6/22/174067.html |archive-url = https://archive.today/20130114035939/http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/1998/6/22/174067.html |url-status = dead |archive-date = 14 January 2013 |title = Book row: McCall fumes over Tordoff's 'cheap' payment |access-date = 30 December 2007 |date = 22 June 1998 |newspaper = Telegraph & Argus}}</ref>

====Everton====
McCall joined Everton at a time when its former triumphant side of the mid-1980s had broken up, following the ban on English sides competing in Europe, which marked the start of a period of underachievement at [[Goodison Park]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html |title=History 1981–2006 |access-date=28 December 2007 |publisher=Everton F.C. |archive-date=27 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127101338/http://www.evertonfc.com/history/kendall-s-heroes.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url = http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2000/4/14/154405.html |archive-url = https://archive.today/20120701162340/http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2000/4/14/154405.html |url-status = dead |archive-date = 1 July 2012 |title = City v Everton: Connections |access-date = 28 December 2007 |date = 14 April 2000 |newspaper = Telegraph & Argus}}</ref> His Everton debut came in a 4–0 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 27 August 1988 against his former teammate Hendrie, who was making his debut for Newcastle.<ref>{{cite book |last=McCall |title=The Real McCall |page=70}}</ref> McCall also returned to [[Valley Parade]] for a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] tie, but his Everton side were knocked out by Bradford 3–1 on 14 December 1988.<ref>{{cite book |last=McCall |title=The Real McCall |pages=70–71}}</ref> He started 29 league games in [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]] as well as another four substitute appearances, but failed to score in the league. He was also a substitute in the [[1989 FA Cup Final]] when he scored Everton's stoppage time equaliser in the [[Merseyside derby]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] to take the game into extra-time. He scored another equaliser during extra-time, but Liverpool's own substitute [[Ian Rush]] also scored two to secure a 3–2 victory for Liverpool.<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news |first=William |last=Johnson |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2003/01/09/sfnshe09.xml |title=McCall calls the shots in tireless show |date=8 January 2003 |access-date=4 January 2008 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph | location=London}}{{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

McCall made a second appearance in an Everton shirt at Valley Parade, when he was invited by former teammate [[Mark Ellis (footballer born 1962)|Mark Ellis]] to bring a side for his testimonial. In three seasons at Everton, McCall played 103 league games as well as earned his first [[cap (sport)|cap]]s with [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] but he failed to lift any trophies as the club finished eighth, sixth and ninth in the league. Apart from the FA Cup final defeat in 1989, the closest he came to winning a trophy at Everton was in the [[1989–90 in English football|1989–90 season]], when Everton topped the league in late autumn and remained in contention for the title for most of the rest of the season until disappointing form in the run-in saw them finish sixth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/history/records/league-record.asp |title=Everton League Record |access-date=20 March 2008 |publisher=Toffee Web}}</ref>

====Rangers====
In the summer of 1991, McCall signed for Scottish club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] for £1.2 million.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.bradfordcityfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/BantamsGreats/0,,10266~119234,00.html |archive-url = https://archive.today/20120630224818/http://www.bradfordcityfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/BantamsGreats/0,,10266~119234,00.html |url-status = dead |archive-date = 30 June 2012 |title = Stuart McCall Bantams Greats |access-date = 27 December 2007 |publisher = Bradford City A.F.C.}}</ref> Rangers had just won their third successive [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Scottish Premier Division]] title.

Under newly appointed manager [[Walter Smith]], McCall ended up playing in the final six of the club's [[Nine in a row|nine successive Scottish league titles]], and with Rangers also winning a string of cup competitions during that time, McCall picked up a total of ten major trophies north of the border.<ref name=rfchof/><ref name=fsrfc/> In his first season at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], Rangers won the league and cup double, before they achieved greater success in [[1992–93 in Scottish football|1992–93]], winning both cups 2–1 against [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and coming nine points ahead of Aberdeen in the league.<ref name="rangers history">{{cite web |url = http://www.rangers.premiumtv.co.uk/page/clubhistory/0,,5~1577415,00.html |title = 1997 Nine in a row |access-date = 18 March 2008 |publisher = Rangers F.C.}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> McCall also enjoyed European success that season when the Glasgow club narrowly missed out on an appearance in the [[UEFA Champions League 1992-93|UEFA Champions League 1992–93]] final, coming second in the semi-final group stage to eventual winners [[Olympique de Marseille]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/UCL/history/Season=1992/intro.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211120922/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/UCL/history/Season=1992/intro.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 December 2005 |title=French first for Marseille |access-date=17 December 2007 |date=1 January 2006 |publisher=UEFA}}</ref> Citing the reason for their success as the spirit which Smith instilled in the team, McCall later said: "It was an incredible season. We won the domestic Treble, we went 44 games unbeaten and we did not lose a single game in Europe. And, though we said we would do it again next year, we all knew it was unrepeatable."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/the-battle-of-britain-more-like-a-massacre-2077039.html |title=The Battle of Britain?

In [[1993–94 in Scottish football|1993–94]], Rangers added another [[Scottish League Cup]] title along with the league championship, but lost 1–0 in the final of the [[Scottish Cup 1993-94|Scottish Cup]] to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], surprisingly being denied a second successive treble. The following season saw Rangers win the league by their greatest margin as they finished 15 points ahead of [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]], but they failed to reach the final of either of the domestic cups. Although their winning margin was reduced to four points, from city rivals [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], in [[1995–96 in Scottish football|1995–96]], Rangers' points tally of 87 was a record-high total. 

McCall played in his fourth Scottish Cup final as Rangers defeated [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] 5–1. His Rangers side again pushed Celtic into second place in [[1996–97 in Scottish football|1996–97]] and defeated Hearts 4–3 in the Scottish League Cup (McCall had suffered an injury prior to that final which ruled him out until the end of the season, and he did not play in sufficient league games for a medal).<ref name="rfchof" /><ref name="fsrfc" /> But with the club chasing an unprecedented 10th straight title in [[1997–98 in Scottish football|1997–98]] they had to settle for the runners-up position, with Celtic winning the league by two points on the final day of the season. McCall was substituted in the Scottish Cup final defeat to [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] as Rangers went the season without picking up a single title for the first season in McCall's time at the club.<ref name="rangers history" />
In February 2008, McCall became the 71st inductee into the Rangers hall of fame. McCall's former teammate and Rangers assistant manager [[Ally McCoist]] presented him with the award.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphandargus.co.uk/display.var.2070846.0.my_shock_at_gazzas_sad_demise.php |title='My shock at Gazza's sad demise' |date=25 February 2008 |access-date=25 February 2008 |newspaper=Telegraph & Argus |first=Simon |last=Parker}}</ref>

====Return to Bradford City====
McCall still had one year left on his Rangers contract in 1998, but much of the team that Walter Smith had built had left and McCall was allowed to leave on a free transfer by new manager [[Dick Advocaat]], as long as he joined an English club.<ref name="markham"/> [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] and [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] were both interested in signing McCall, but he rejoined [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] as club captain.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.thisisbradford.co.uk/1998/6/3/174600.html |title=City was perfect chance: McCall |access-date=28 December 2007 |date=3 June 1998 |newspaper=Telegraph & Argus |archive-date=4 January 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104073232/http://archive.thisisbradford.co.uk/1998/6/3/174600.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Rookie manager [[Paul Jewell]] put together a squad which emerged as surprise promotion contenders after two seasons spent battling relegation, adding other new signings, including central midfield partner [[Gareth Whalley]] and [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[Lee Mills]], who went on to be club's top goal-scorer.<ref name="markhamjewell">{{cite book |last=Markham |title=The legends of Bradford City |page=99}}</ref> The season started off slowly with just one win from the first seven games, but by the latter half of the season, City were vying with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] for the second promotion spot behind runaway leaders [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]].

===International career===
[[File:Mccall scotland.jpg|thumb|upright|McCall (right) playing for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] during [[UEFA Euro 96|Euro 96]]]]

McCall was picked for [[England national under-21 football team|England]] and [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland]] under-21 sides on the same day in 1984,<ref>{{cite book |last=McCall |title=The Real McCall |pages=32–33}}</ref> and chose to join the England under-21 squad for their game against [[Turkey national under-21 football team|Turkey]]. However he was only picked as a substitute and the referee blew the final whistle, with McCall waiting to come on.<ref>{{cite book |last=McCall |title=The Real McCall |pages=35–36}}</ref> He later told Scottish newspaper ''[[Glasgow Herald]]'', "I felt it was a mistake almost from the start. I was put on the bench and they tried to bring me on with a minute to go. But I took my time re-tying my boots and generally warming up and luckily didn't get on, otherwise that would have been that."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bale |first1=John |last2=Maguire |first2=Joseph A. |title=The Global Sports Arena |publisher=Routledge |year=1994 |isbn=0-7146-3489-1 |page=88}}</ref> Since he had not actually played for England, McCall was still eligible for Scotland. He eventually switched allegiances to the latter, for whom he qualified through his father. He made his Scotland debut at under-21 level in March 1988, ironically against England.<ref name="frost"/> McCall made one more appearance for Scotland under 21s, against [[France national under-21 football team|France]] in 1990.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Rollin |editor2-last=Rollin |title=Sky Sports Football Yearbook 2007–2008 |page=966}}</ref>

Later the same year, McCall was called up to the [[Scotland national football team|Scottish senior]] team.

McCall represented Scotland at the European Championships in [[UEFA Euro 1992|1992]], when they again failed to go beyond the group stage after defeats to [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany national football team|Germany]], and in [[UEFA Euro 96|1996]] when they were edged out in the first round by Netherlands.<ref name = "sfa">{{SFA Profile|id=14370}}</ref> Scotland failed to qualify for the World Cup in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. McCall played just two qualifying games for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and his last cap came in a friendly against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] on 25 March 1998, as he was overlooked for the final squad for the finals in France along with team-mate [[Ally McCoist]].<ref>{{cite news |url = http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/1998/6/8/174489.html |archive-url = https://archive.today/20120711122421/http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/1998/6/8/174489.html |url-status = dead |archive-date = 11 July 2012 |title = McCall's World Cup blast |access-date = 3 December 2007 |date = 8 June 1998 |newspaper = Telegraph & Argus}}</ref> He was capped a total of 40 times for Scotland, scoring one goal.
