===Reception===
Former [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] player [[Henrik Larsson]] commented on Potter's pattern of play, stating he "played all different kinds of systems, starting off a match one way, and then halfway through they started playing a different system, and then they ended up with a third system. And all the players knew exactly what they were doing."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/arsenal-ostersunds-fk-graham-potter-europa-league-henrik-larsson-a8210301.html |title='Playing Arsenal is like Christmas': How Graham Potter transformed Ostersund and inspired Sweden's north |first=Lawrence |last=Ostlere |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=14 February 2018 |access-date=11 June 2018}}</ref>
Guardiola admitted that he was a "big fan" of Potter, saying that Potter's "Brighton are a joy to watch, a joy to analyse" and that his "players move with freedom and everyone knows what they have to do.

In October 2021, BBC Sport published a feature on Potter's rise and regarded him as a possible [[England national football team|England]] manager in the making.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59037905|title=Graham Potter: Is Brighton boss an England manager in the making? |first=Sean |last=Cole |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 October 2021 |access-date=31 October 2021 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20220908070507/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59037905 |archive-date=8 September 2022}}</ref>
