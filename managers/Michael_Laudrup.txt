'''Michael Laudrup''' ({{IPA|da|ˈmiˌkʰɛˀl ˈlɑwˀtʁɔp}}, born 15 June 1964) is a Danish professional [[Association football|football]] coach and former player. Renowned for his composure, passing, vision, technical skills, ball control, and dribbling ability, Laudrup is widely regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of all time.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Warrington |first1=Mark WhiteContributions from Declan |last2=Haugstad |first2=Thore |last3=Stafford-Bloor |first3=Seb |last4=Spurling |first4=Jon |last5=Murray |first5=Andrew |last6=Yokhin |first6=Michael |last7=Hess |first7=Alex |last8=Reid |first8=Alex |last9=published |first9=Marcus Alves |date=5 September 2023 |title=Ranked!

During his playing career, Laudrup won league titles with [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] and [[Juventus FC|Juventus]], playing mainly as an [[attacking midfielder]], although he was also capable of playing in other attacking positions. In a period where Laudrup was recognized as one of the best football players of his generation, he became a key member of [[Johan Cruyff]]'s "[[FC Barcelona#Dream Team|Dream Team]]". At Barcelona, Laudrup claimed nine trophies in total, including four successive [[La Liga]] titles from 1991 to 1994 and the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in [[1992 European Cup Final|1992]], as he moved to [[El Clásico|arch-rivals]] Real Madrid in 1994, with whom he won his fifth consecutive La Liga title.

Laudrup made his debut for the [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]] on his 18th birthday in 1982, and scored 37 goals in 104 appearances. He starred in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], and from November 1994, he captained Denmark for a total of 28 matches,<ref>Michael Laudrup started his last 27 matches as captain, while he had taken over the armband in the 1 June 1994 1–2 loss to [[Norway national football team|Norway]], when then captain [[Lars Olsen]] was substituted.</ref> including the victorious [[1995 King Fahd Cup|1995 Confederations Cup]] tournament. He played alongside his brother Brian in the Denmark team that reached the quarter-finals of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], and retired as an active player after the tournament.

In 1999, Laudrup was voted the Best Foreign Player in Spanish Football over the preceding 25-year period<ref>IFHOC, [http://www.hallofchampions.com/gala/index.html The Gala in Barcelona] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718041138/http://www.hallofchampions.com/gala/index.html |date=18 July 2011 }}, 1 February 1999.</ref> and in April 2000 he was knighted, receiving the [[Order of the Dannebrog]].

On 16 October 2021, at a show celebrating the [[National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark]]'s 125th anniversary, 125 candidates for the title of the greatest ever Danish sports star had been reduced to eight, and Laudrup was named the winner.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dr.dk/sporten/roerende-taler-og-gensyn-med-legender-se-det-bedste-fra-difs-jubilaeumsshow-her|title=The greatest of the great sports stars|date=16 October 2021|work=DR|location=Denmark}}</ref>

After retiring as a player, Laudrup took up coaching, and became assistant manager of the Denmark national team. He got his first manager job at former club [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] in 2002, whom he guided to the 2005 [[Danish Superliga]] championship. He chose not to extend his contract with Brøndby in May 2006. He took over as coach of [[Getafe CF|Getafe]] and had notable success there. He brought the club comparative success in the [[Copa del Rey]] and [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], and the team's attacking style received plaudits. On 15 June 2012, Laudrup was appointed the manager of [[Premier League]] club [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] on a two-year contract.<ref>Clutton, Graham (15 June 2012) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/swansea-city/9333566/Michael-Laudrup-appointed-new-Swansea-City-manager.html Laudrup appointed Swansea City manager].

==Club career==
Born in [[Frederiksberg]], Copenhagen,<ref name=BDFutbol/> Michael Laudrup began playing football in father [[Finn Laudrup]]'s childhood club [[Vanløse IF|Vanløse]]. When Finn Laudrup became player/coach of [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] in 1973, the family moved to [[Brøndby]] and both Michael and his brother [[Brian Laudrup]] started playing for the club as well. Michael followed his father to the top-flight [[Danish 1st Division]] club [[Københavns Boldklub|KB]] in 1976, while Brian remained at Brøndby.

===Early career===
Laudrup made his senior debut playing for [[Kjøbenhavns Boldklub|KB]] in 1981, and made his debut for the Danish under-19 national team in February 1981.<ref>{{in lang|da}} [http://home6.inet.tele.dk/pin/landsholdet/Laudrup_Michael.htm Laudrup, Michael] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331041420/http://home6.inet.tele.dk/pin/landsholdet/Laudrup_Michael.htm |date=31 March 2007 }} at ''Peders Fodboldstatistik''.</ref> In all, he scored a combined total of 14 goals in 25 games at various youth levels. He went back to play for Brøndby in 1982, where his father had ended his career in 1981, contributing to the [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] of Brøndby to the 1st Division.

At Brøndby, Laudrup scored two goals in the club's 1st Division debut game, as fellow promoted team [[Boldklubben 1909|B 1909]] were beaten 7–1. He scored 15 league goals in 1982, and ended the season as the third top goal scorer of the 1st Division. His accomplishments earned him the 1982 [[Danish Player of the Year]] award. He played part of the 1983 season for Brøndby, and scored nine goals, before he was sold to defending [[Serie A]] champions [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] from Italy in June 1983. It was the biggest [[transfer deal]] in Danish football at the time, worth around $1&nbsp;million. He was due to sign for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] the same year on a three-year contract, but at the last minute, Liverpool proposed a four-year contract and Laudrup opted not to sign.<ref>[[#Kvist|Kvist]] (2001), p. 36.</ref>

===Lazio===

Under restriction of a maximum of two foreign players in the team, of which the club had Polish midfielder [[Zbigniew Boniek]] and [[Michel Platini]], Juventus initially lent Laudrup to newly promoted [[Rome]] club [[SS Lazio|Lazio]] for a single season, something he had not been informed about before signing for Juventus. With Lazio, he scored two goals in his Serie A debut, a 2–4 loss to [[Hellas Verona FC|Hellas Verona]]. In his first year at Lazio, Lazio narrowly avoided [[relegation]], but as Juventus wanted to keep Boniek and Platini, he stayed for another year. Lazio started the [[1984–85 Serie A|1984–85 season]] poorly, eventually finishing in last place to become relegated to [[Serie B]]. Laudrup scored just one goal that season.

===Juventus===

Laudrup returned to Juventus in summer 1985 to replace Zbigniew Boniek, playing alongside Michel Platini. In his first year at the club, he won the [[1985–86 Serie A]] as well as the [[Intercontinental Cup (1960–2004)|Intercontinental Cup]] trophy, scoring the equalising goal in the final of the latter tournament, although he later missed a penalty in the resulting shoot-out;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/en/club/torphy-room/intercontinental-cup/coppa-intercontinentale-1985.php|title=Intercontinental Cup 1985|publisher=juventus.com|access-date=20 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/dec/18/michel-platini-uefa-fifa-juventus|title=Michel Platini's playing brilliance can be seen through the murk|work=The Guardian|author1=Richard Williams|date=18 December 2015|access-date=20 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myjuve.it/season-1985-juventus/intercontinental_cup-juventus-argentinos_juniors-2-2-2617.aspx|title=Intercontinental Cup 1985|publisher=myjuve.it|access-date=20 October 2017}}</ref> he was once again named Danish Player of the Year in 1985. However, the following season was not a success for Laudrup, who suffered multiple injuries. When Platini retired in 1987, Laudrup was expected to lead the team in his place, playing alongside newly bought Welsh forward [[Ian Rush]]. But Laudrup failed to live up to Platini's standards and did not score any goals, despite playing all 30 matches of the [[1987–88 Serie A|1987–88 season]].{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

===Barcelona===
After an unsuccessful season with Juventus, Laudrup decided it was time to leave, looking for a new experience after six years in Italy. In 1989, he joined Spanish club [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] on the premise that Dutch coach [[Johan Cruyff]], his childhood role model, had been assembling a team that was striving for success. Immediately, Laudrup enjoyed major success under Cruyff's leadership, citing the Dutchman's philosophy and perception of the game as one of the main assets that helped foster his talent. He was one of the restricted three foreign players allowed in the team, alongside Dutch defender [[Ronald Koeman]] and Bulgarian striker [[Hristo Stoichkov]], who were the pillars of the ''Barça'' "[[FC Barcelona#Dream Team|Dream Team]]", along with rising stars [[Pep Guardiola]], [[José Mari Bakero]] and [[Txiki Begiristain]].

The Dream Team played attractive football that was comparable to the 1970s [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] team, and won four consecutive [[La Liga]] championships from 1991 to 1994, as well as the [[1991–92 European Cup]], along with the [[1992 UEFA Super Cup]], [[1989–90 Copa del Rey]] and [[1991 Supercopa de España|1991]] and [[1992 Supercopa de España]] titles. Laudrup was twice named the best player of the year in Spain during his Barcelona years. When ''Barça'' hired a fourth foreign star player, Brazilian striker [[Romário]] in 1993, it meant the four foreigners would rotate as the three foreign players allowed in each match, and when he was not selected for the 1994 European Cup final 0–4 loss to [[AC Milan|Milan]] (amid conflicts with Cruyff), his time at Barcelona was effectively over.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/21/michael-laudrup-portrait-of-an-icon-denmark-barcelona-real-madrid|title=Michael Laudrup: a portrait of an icon|first=Daniel|last=Storey|date=21 November 2017|work=The Guardian}}</ref> After the match, Milan's manager [[Fabio Capello]] remarked: "Laudrup was the guy I feared but Cruyff left him out, and that was his mistake."<ref>ABC(spanish newspaper), 20 May 1994</ref>

Laudrup's departure from Barcelona was a huge blow for the fans and his teammates alike. Pep Guardiola was reportedly so upset by the news that he cried and begged Laudrup to change his mind.<ref name="theguardian.com"/> Reflecting on his time at Barcelona, Laudrup commented: "I think we played some very good football, and I think most of all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten best players in the world, you can have the best team. Because everybody talked about Begiristain, Bakero, Guardiola, Stoichkov, and Koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe the best team in the world, together with AC Milan in that period."<ref name="ReferenceC">Sky Sports Special&nbsp;– Football's Greatest: Michael Laudrup.</ref>

===Real Madrid===
In 1994, Laudrup completed a controversial move from ''Barça'' to [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] after he fell out with Johan Cruyff. On this, Laudrup stated he did not have a hidden agenda. It was the year after the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] and according to him, because players usually suffer a drop in performance after such a major international tournament, he correctly predicted that Barcelona would not win major trophies the following season.

Despite widespread belief Laudrup joined arch-rivals Real Madrid in an attempt to "get back" at Cruyff, the decision was based on the fact Real Madrid had been struggling for a long period and were eager to return to supremacy, like Barcelona when he decided to join them. Laudrup said: "People say I wanted to go to Real Madrid just to get revenge. I say revenge from what? I've had a perfect time; five fantastic years here [at Barcelona]. I went to Madrid because they were so hungry to win, and they had four or five players who went to the World Cup. I said this would be perfect; new coach, new players, and hungry to win."<ref name="ReferenceC"/> On 5 November 1994, he assisted [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl]]'s first professional goal in a 4–2 win over [[Atlético Madrid]]<ref>{{Cite web|date=7 April 2018|url=https://www.realmadrid.com/en/news/2018/04/historic-goals-raul|title=Historic Goals Raúl|publisher=Real Madrid CF|access-date=11 November 2020}}</ref>

Laudrup went on to guide Real Madrid in a championship-winning season that would end the ''Barça'' stranglehold, making him on record the only player to win the Spanish league five consecutive seasons playing for two different clubs. After the initial success at Real, a lacklustre club season would follow. Despite only playing two seasons at Real Madrid, he was voted the 12th-best player in Real Madrid history in an internet survey by Spanish newspaper ''[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]'' when the club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2002.<ref>{{in lang|da}} Palle "Banks" Jørgensen, "''Landsholdenes 2198 profiler''", Danmark, 2004, {{ISBN|87-89564-04-9}}, p. 214.</ref> The following season while playing for Real Madrid, he aided in the revenge beating Madrid gave ''Barça'', the final score also ending 5–0. [[Daniel Storey]] wrote of Laudrup, "no other player is loved on both sides of the clásico divide quite like Laudrup" as he remains held in high regard by both Barça and Madrid fans.<ref name="theguardian.com"/> Following the match, Laudrup's former Barcelona manager Cruyff commented: "When Michael plays like a dream, a magic illusion, determined to show his new team his extreme abilities, no one in the world comes anywhere near his level."<ref name="ReferenceB">"Laudrup&nbsp;– Et fodbolddynasti", Christian Mohr Boisen, {{ISBN|978-87-11-31387-9}}</ref>

===Later career and retirement===
In 1996, Laudrup left Real Madrid to play for [[Vissel Kobe]] in Japan. On 18 August 1996, he played his first match for Vissel Kobe and scored two goals in a 4–2 win against [[Brummell Sendai]].<ref>週刊サッカーマガジン 1996年9月11日 no.571号 p.26-28 ベースボールマガジン社</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vissel-kobe.co.jp/match/result96.html|title=ヴィッセル神戸 1996 |publisher=Visselkobe |access-date=16 October 2020}}</ref><ref name="daily">{{cite news |url=https://www.daily.co.jp/soccer/matome/2019/09/08/m_0000510.shtml |title=イニエスタ！ビジャ！Ｊ１神戸の大物外国人の系譜 |publisher=www.daily.co.jp |date=8 September 2019 |access-date=16 October 2020}}</ref> On 15 September 1996, he recorded three assists, including his first assist for Vissel Kobe in a 5–1 victory against [[Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo]].<ref>週刊サッカーマガジン 10 October 1996 no.575 p.120-125</ref> He helped Vissel to promotion from the [[Japan Football League (1992–1998)|second-tier Japan Football League]] to the [[J1 League]].<ref name="daily"/>

He was registered as a player in [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Premier League]] club [[NK Čelik Zenica|Čelik Zenica]] in a controversial signing in which he did not play any games for Čelik, but was signed as a player.<ref>[http://www.fyens.dk/article/90102:Sport--Laudrup-var-registreret-i-bosnisk-klub-SNYD--Det-hollandske-skattevaesen-foeler-sig-snydt-i-forbindelse-med-Michael-Laudrups-skifte-til-Ajax Laudrup var registreret i bosnisk klub SNYD: Det hollandske skattevćsen fřler sig snydt i forbindelse med Michael Laudrups skifte til Ajax&nbsp;– fyens.dk&nbsp;– Sport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060142/http://www.fyens.dk/article/90102:Sport--Laudrup-var-registreret-i-bosnisk-klub-SNYD--Det-hollandske-skattevaesen-foeler-sig-snydt-i-forbindelse-med-Michael-Laudrups-skifte-til-Ajax |date=21 September 2013 }}. fyens.dk. 23 October 2004.</ref> After the details were resolved, he ended his playing career in a championship winning season at Dutch side Ajax in 1998.

Following his retirement, Laudrup sometimes turned out to play for [[Lyngby Boldklub|Lyngby]]'s Old Boys team in his spare time.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120320215520/http://lyngby-boldklub.dk/Nyheder/Seneste_nyt/Trupperne_til_Oldboys_Landspokalfinalen/ Trupperne til Oldboys Landspokalfinalen]. lyngby-boldklub.dk. 13 October 2005.</ref>

==International career==
Laudrup was called up for the [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]] during Brøndby's debut season in the top-flight. On his 18th birthday on 15 June 1982, he became the then-second-youngest Danish national team player ever, following [[Harald Nielsen]]. Despite playing for relegation battlers Lazio, Laudrup starred for the Denmark national team at [[UEFA Euro 1984]], playing all four of Denmark's matches.

Laudrup participated in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] in Mexico, a performance which is best remembered for his exceptional solo dribble and goal in the 6–1 defeat of [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. He was also a part of the disappointing Denmark squad at [[UEFA Euro 1988|Euro 1988]], though Laudrup experienced personal success, scoring one of Denmark's two goals.

Following three matches in the qualification campaign for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]], Laudrup opted to quit the national team in November 1990 (alongside his brother Brian Laudrup and [[Jan Mølby]]) following differences with coach [[Richard Møller Nielsen]].<ref>"Historien om Michael Laudrups farvel", ''[[Politiken]]'', 26 November 1990, Section:Sport, p. 2.</ref> The Danes originally failed to qualify but were later given [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]'s place as Yugoslavia were disqualified due to [[Yugoslav Wars|war in their country]]. Notwithstanding their qualification, Laudrup rated Denmark's chances of success so low he stayed on holiday. However, Denmark caused one of the biggest upsets in football history by going on to win the tournament, beating holders [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] in the semi-final and, in the [[UEFA Euro 1992 Final|final]] beating reigning world champions and favourites [[Germany national football team|Germany]], with a 2–0 win thanks to goals from [[John Jensen]] and [[Kim Vilfort]].

Laudrup returned to Nielsen's Danish squad in August 1993, but saw [[Spain men's national football team|Spain]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] ahead of Denmark. He scored a goal in the 2–0 victory against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], as Denmark won the [[1995 King Fahd Cup|1995 Intercontinental Cup]]. He also scored four goals in ten matches as Denmark qualified for [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]].

Laudrup's last matches for Denmark came at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], when he captained the nation to the quarterfinal. Laudrup made his [[List of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps|100th appearance]] for Denmark in the team's opening game of the tournament, a 1–0 defeat of [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-06-14/sports/9806130177_1_michael-laudrup-world-cup-marc-rieper|title=Laudrup Celebrates Centennial Cap|date=14 June 1998|agency=Associated Press|access-date=30 November 2015|archive-date=8 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208141709/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-06-14/sports/9806130177_1_michael-laudrup-world-cup-marc-rieper|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 24 June, he scored a goal in a 1-2 defeat to [[France national football team|France]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/1998france/match-center/8762|title=1998 FIFA WORLD CUP FRANCE - DENMARK|publisher=FIFA|access-date=9 March 2024}}</ref> On 28 June, Laudrup provided two assists in a 4–1 win over the [[Nigeria men's national football team|Nigeria]] in the round of 16.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.foxsports.com/stories/soccer/world-cups-101-most-memorable-moments-laudrup|title=World Cup's 101 Most Memorable Moments: Michael Laudrup's no-look |date=15 August 2022|access-date=8 March 2024|work=FOX SPORTS}}</ref> Denmark was defeated 2–3 by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-finals, and both Michael and Brian Laudrup announced their international retirement following the elimination.

===Style of play===
[[File:Michael Laudrup 2015b.jpg|thumb|Laudrup demonstrating his skills in Qatar, 2015]]

A quick, intelligent and talented midfielder, known for his pace on the ball, Laudrup is regarded as one of the most effective and versatile [[attacking midfielders]], as well as one of the most skilful and elegant players in the history of the game. Although primarily an [[Playmaker#Advanced playmakers|offensive playmaker]], he was capable of playing in several positions in or behind the front-line, and was even deployed as a [[Winger (association football)|winger]], as a [[central midfielder]] or [[deep-lying playmaker]], or as a [[second striker]] on occasion, in particular in his youth, or even as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] or [[Striker (association football)|striker]] on rarer instances; he was also used as a [[centre-forward]] on occasion under his Barcelona manager [[Johan Cruyff]], a role which was similar to that of the modern [[false 9]] role, as well as the free centre-forward role in which Cruyff often operated throughout his playing career. Laudrup is considered by many in the sport as one of the best passers of all time, and as one of the most technically accomplished players ever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ilpalloneracconta.blogspot.ca/2008/06/quando-arriva-alla-lazio-michelino-gi.html|title=Michael LAUDRUP|publisher=Il Pallone Racconta|language=it|access-date=9 December 2014}}</ref><ref name="Michael Laudrup">{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/history/card/michael-laudrup|title=Michael Laudrup|publisher=FC Barcelona|access-date=9 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportmediaset.mediaset.it/calcio/calcio/articoli/71652/i-piu-grandi-numeri-11-della-storia.shtml|title=I più grandi numeri 11 della storia|publisher=Sport Mediaset|language=it|author1=MASSIMILIANO CRISTINA|date=11 November 2011|access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/18426736.app|title=Jan Molby backs Michael Laudrup for Swansea City manager job|publisher=BBC|date=13 June 2012|access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref><ref name="tuttojuve.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttojuve.com/gli-eroi-bianconeri/gli-eroi-in-bianconero-michael-laudrup-193006|title=Gli eroi in bianconero: Michael LAUDRUP|publisher=tuttojuve.com|language=it|author=Stefano Bedeschi|access-date=9 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://it.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=1924706.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031084349/http://it.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=1924706.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=31 October 2017|title=La vittoria più bella di Laudrup|publisher=UEFA|language=it|date=25 February 2013|access-date=11 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1634018-25-most-skilled-passers-in-world-football-history |title=25 Most Skilled Passers in World Football History |publisher=bleacherreport.com |author1=Max Towle |date=9 May 2013 |access-date=10 October 2018 }}</ref><ref name="FCB Official Profile">{{cite web |url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/card/648078/michael-laudrup |title=Michael Laudrup |publisher=FC Barcelona |access-date=29 June 2020 }}</ref><ref name="Brian Laudrup Perfect XI"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/brendan-rodgers-aims-follow-pep-2833794 |title=Rodgers aims to follow Guardiola on Johan Cruyff's path |work=The Leicester Mercury |last1=Blackwell |first1=Jordan |date=5 May 2019 |access-date=10 October 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/blogs/in-search-of-johan-cruijff-338140 |title=In Search Of Johan Cruijff... |publisher=World Soccer |last=Rainbow |first=Jamie |date=25 November 2012 |access-date=25 September 2016 }}</ref>

Regarding Laudrup's vision and passing ability, his brother [[Brian Laudrup|Brian]] stated in 2008: "My brother started as an attacker but became an elegant attacking midfielder, perhaps the most complete there has ever been. His vision, speed of thought and passing were on a different level; he always knew what was going to happen before anybody else did.

Nicknamed "The Prince of Denmark,"<ref name=fourfourtwo.com/><ref name=storiedicalcio/> throughout his career, Laudrup was acclaimed for his technique, balance, elegance, ball control, and [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] ability, as well as his vision, ability to read the game, and range of passing, including deep passes, through balls, and [[Cross (association football)|crosses]], which made him an excellent [[Assist (association football)|assist]] provider.<ref name=treccani.it>{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/michael-e-brian-laudrup_%28Enciclopedia_dello_Sport%29/|title=LAUDRUP, Michael e Brian|publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport (2002)|language=it|author1=Salvatore Lo Presti|access-date=9 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/news/1141715/legendary-laudrup |title=Legendary Laudrup |publisher=FC Barcelona |date=3 April 2013 |access-date=14 December 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/21/michael-laudrup-portrait-of-an-icon-denmark-barcelona-real-madrid |title=Michael Laudrup: a portrait of an icon |work=The Guardian |last1=Storey |first1=Daniel |date=21 November 2017 |access-date=14 December 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.realmadrid.com/en/about-real-madrid/history/football-legends/michael-laudrup |title=The King of the final ball |publisher=Real Madrid |access-date=14 December 2019}}</ref> In regard to his vision, [[Jorge Valdano]], the Argentinian coach of Laudrup in Real Madrid, said, "[He] has eyes everywhere."

The Laudrup dribble, a signature feint also known as the ''croqueta'', was perhaps the best-known part of his game, and involved him quickly moving the ball from one foot to the other away from the defender, a move which was later also popularised by later Barcelona midfielder [[Andrés Iniesta]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/international-football/2017/01/16/587cba1046163fdd518b4612.html |title=The best 'croquetas' in world football |newspaper=Marca |date=16 January 2017 |access-date=3 August 2018 }}</ref> Laudrup's ball skills and [[Dummy (football)|feints]] were combined with creativity, which he used to get past defenders in one on one situations.<ref name=storiedicalcio/> This led to the expression "Made in Laudrup" being coined in the Spanish football media, which was widely used in Spain to describe his trademark assists, in particular his lobbed passes, as well as his unique play.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2012/03/15/futbol/1331831557.html |title=Un paseo por el infierno |work=El Mundo |language=es |last1=Castelao |first1=Eduardo J. |date=16 March 2012 |access-date=29 June 2020 }}</ref> According to a 2018 article by Josh Butler of ''[[The Athletic]]'' and ''[[These Football Times]]'', several of Laudrup's teammates said of his creative style of play: "Just run, he will always find a way of passing you the ball."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://theathletic.co.uk/1303565/2019/10/18/messi-suarez-and-neymar-vs-romario-laudrup-and-stoichkov-the-battle-of-barcelonas-holy-trinities/ |title=Messi, Suarez and Neymar vs Romario, Laudrup and Stoichkov: The battle of Barcelona's holy trinities |last1=Butler |first1=Josh |work=The New York Times |date=18 October 2019 |access-date=29 June 2020 }}</ref>

===Reception===
Throughout his career, Laudrup was often ranked among the best players in the world, with the French three-time [[Ballon d'Or|European footballer of the year]] award winner [[Michel Platini]] describing him as one of the most talented players ever, only lamenting his lack of selfishness causing him to score too few goals.<ref name="jubilee">Frits Ahlstrøm, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071017163655/http://www.uefa.com/uefa/history/associationweeks/association%3D35/newsId%3D145557.html Laudrup is greatest Dane], [[UEFA]], 29 March 2004</ref><ref>Frits Ahlstrøm, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071017163655/http://www.uefa.com/uefa/history/associationweeks/association%3D35/newsId%3D145557.html Laudrup is greatest Dane], [[UEFA]], 29 March 2004.</ref> In a 2006 interview, Laudrup's Real Madrid teammate [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl]] called him the best player he had ever played with,<ref name="ReferenceA">"Kongesønnens bøn: Kom til Madrid", ''[[Ekstra Bladet]]'', 16 April 2006</ref><ref>"Kongesønnens bøn: Kom til Madrid", ''[[Ekstra Bladet]]'', 16 April 2006.</ref> a view echoed by his Barcelona teammate Romário, who opined that he was able to create and score goals almost at will, and ranked him the fourth-best player in the history of the game (behind [[Pelé]], [[Diego Maradona]] and himself).<ref name="Romarios eftermæle">{{cite news|work=[[Jyllands-Posten]]|date=8 March 2008|access-date=8 March 2008|url=http://jp.dk/arkiv/?id=379867&eceExpr=Romarios%20efterm%E6le&eceArchive=o |title=Romarios eftermæle}}</ref> [[Luís Figo]] instead labelled Laudrup as arguably the best opponent he had ever faced.<ref>{{cite news|title=Figo casts an eye to the future|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=103291.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119121900/http://fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=103291.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 November 2007|publisher=FIFA|date=13 March 2006}}</ref> [[Ronald Koeman]] rated Laudrup as "possibly the most skillful and elegant player [he] ever played with," adding: "Few could dribble like he could.

Maybe he didn't get the media recognition he deserved, but he was so classy and a real thinker. A master of the blind pass and impossible through-balls and I will never forget his 'spoon' pass in a game against Osasuna.

At Barcelona, Laudrup played alongside [[Hristo Stoichkov]], who scored many goals from Laudrup's passes. Regarding Laudrup's ability to create chances for his teammates, he commented in his 2008 autobiography: "From more than hundred goals that I scored I'm sure that over 50 were assisted by Michael. To play with him was extremely easy. We found each other by intuition on the field and found common football language. Look at [[Iván Zamorano]]. Laudrup went there [Real] and Zamorano is a goalscorer. Sometimes I envy Ivan for the passes he receives. Passes on foot after you accelerated. Few people understand football like the Danish player. He can only be compared with Maradona, [[Bernd Schuster|Schuster]] or Roberto Baggio. They make things easy and find the right solutions. For them [it] is simple, for the opponent&nbsp;– unthinkable. Phenomenal! His only problem is his character. He is emotional and terribly reserved. This affects him a lot, because he takes everything personally&nbsp;– no matter if someone tells him something or decision that he does not agree. His relations with Cruyff were delicate because he couldn't take the critics. I listen to him but I don't care that much. For Michael this was fatal. He couldn't take it anymore so he left without a word."<ref>{{cite news|title=My Autobiography, Hristo Stoichkov |url=http://www.libroelocho.com/ |publisher=The 8cho |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711190008/http://www.libroelocho.com/ |archive-date=11 July 2008 }}</ref> That same year, in an interview with ''[[FourFourTwo]]'', Stoichkov included Laudrup in his "Perfect XI," and labelled him as: "One of the best European players I've ever seen," and as a player who was "up there with the greats." He went on to describe him as: "An elegant, old-fashioned playmaker," who "did things few other footballers could do."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/perfectxi/125/article.aspx|title=Hristo Stoichkov Perfect XI|publisher=FourFourTwo|date=12 March 2008}}</ref> In 2010, he instead said that "Laudrup was the greatest."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://secure.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/generelle/stoichkov-bullshit-med-romario?page=0%2C4|title=Stoichkov: Bullshit med Romario|publisher=Tipsbladet|language=da|date=12 November 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007145704/https://secure.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/generelle/stoichkov-bullshit-med-romario?page=0,4|archive-date=7 October 2011}}</ref>

Another striker who benefitted from Laudrup's playmaking abilities was Real Madrid teammate Iván Zamorano, who called Laudrup "''El Genio''" ("The Genius," in Spanish) during Laudrup's time in the Spanish capital. Zamorano was going through a hard spell in Madrid, but when Laudrup arrived to assist his goals, Zamorano immediately became the top goalscorer of La Liga, winning the ''pichichi'' trophy; Zamorano himself credited Laudrup for his role in his increased goalscoring output, describing him as a "genius," while also commenting: "...The reason why I make so many goals is Laudrup."<ref name=fourfourtwo.com/><ref name="ReferenceB"/> He also stated: "Michael was a magician and one of the greatest players ever. He was amazing in one-on-ones too. I always say that Laudrup had three eyes, not two like everyone else.

Throughout his career, his number of assists were almost always the highest of his team. However, despite his talent and reputation as one of the most technically gifted and creative players of his generation, certain players, pundits and managers have questioned Laudrup's work rate, mentality, determination, and consistency throughout his career at times, in particular in his early career.<ref name="tuttojuve.com"/><ref name=fourfourtwo.com/><ref name=storiedicalcio>{{cite web|url=http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/michael-laudrup.html|title=Michael Laudrup: Il Principe di Danimarca|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=it|access-date=9 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=treccani.it/> His former Juventus teammate and admirer Michel Platini, for example, once said, "[Laudrup]'s the greatest player in the world, in training,"<ref name=storiedicalcio/><ref name=treccani.it/> also describing him as "one of the biggest talents ever," while also lamenting that he "never used his talent to its fullest during matches."<ref name="ReferenceB"/> His former Barcelona manager Johan Cruyff described him as "One of the most difficult players [he had] worked with," adding: "When he gives 80–90% he is still by far the best, but I want 100%, and he rarely does that."<ref>"Laudrup&nbsp;– Et fodbolddynasti", Christian Mohr Boisen,{{ISBN|978-87-11-31387-9}}</ref> In 1998, he stated: "Had Michael been born in a poor ghetto in Brazil or Argentina with the ball being his only way out of poverty he would today be recognised as the biggest genius of the game ever.

==Managerial career==
[[File:Michael-laudrup-2000.jpg|thumb|right|Laudrup during his time as assistant manager of Denmark in 2000]]

===Early years===
After his playing career ended with Ajax, Laudrup became a coach at age 36 when he started serving as an assistant coach for the Denmark national team head coach [[Morten Olsen]] in 2000. The national team would play a [[4-2-3-1|4–2–3–1 formation]], depending on two fast [[winger (football)|wingers]] and with the aim to dominate games with a short-passing possession game. Together, they led Denmark to the knock-out stage of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]].

===Brøndby===
After his success as Denmark assistant manager, Laudrup signed on as manager for [[Danish Superliga]] club Brøndby. As his assistant coach, he paired up with former Danish championship winning manager [[John Jensen]], who had played alongside him in the Denmark national team. At the start of his reign, he proclaimed a tactical scheme close to that which Olsen and he had coached at the national team. He renovated the Brøndby team by letting a large contingent of older and experienced players leave, in favour of several new offensive players, and he also gave the chance to young talents from the club's youth scheme.

[[File:Michael Laudrup, 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Laudrup as [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] manager in 2005]]

To ensure the defensive strength of the team, Laudrup signed proven national team player [[Morten Wieghorst]]. He began his reign as Brøndby manager by winning his first trophy in his managerial career, the 2002 [[Danish Supercup]]. In his first season as head coach, he guided the team to win the [[2002–03 Danish Cup|Danish Cup]], after Brøndby beat [[FC Midtjylland|Midtjylland]] 3–0 in the final and runners-up in the [[2002–03 Danish Superliga|Danish Superliga]]. Laudrup's success led him to being voted and awarded the Danish Manager of the Year.

In the [[2003–04 Danish Superliga|following season]], he again finished the season runners-up to first place [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] by just one point. However, he would not be denied in the [[2004-05 in Danish football|2004–05 season]], where he finally led the team to the [[2004–05 Danish Superliga|Danish Superliga]] title. In the same season, he also completed [[Double (association football)|The Double]] after he won his second [[2004–05 Danish Cup|Danish Cup]] in four seasons. This saw him being given his second Danish Manager of the Year award. After finishing runners-up in the [[2005–06 Danish Superliga]], Laudrup announced that he, along with assistant Faxe Jensen, could not come to an agreement for a one-year contract extension that was offered by the club. The pair, after winning four trophies in four seasons, subsequently left Brøndby in June 2006.<ref>[http://origin.foxsports.news.com.au/story/0,8659,19225470-23210,00.html Laudrup leaving Brondby], [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]], 22 May 2006.</ref>

Laudrup was associated with several new jobs, including becoming manager of former club Real Madrid and that he would replace [[Lars Lagerbäck]] as head coach of the [[Sweden men's national football team|Sweden national team]].

In 2007, Brøndby decided to name a new lounge at the stadium "The Michael Laudrup Lounge", with Laudrup's approval. His success led him to being voted and awarded the Danish Manager of the Year.

===Getafe===
On 21 June 2007, Laudrup was linked to a move to [[Madrid]]-based La Liga club [[Getafe CF|Getafe]] by sports newspaper ''Marca''. This was confirmed on 9 July 2007. During his stay in Getafe, the club reached the [[2008 Copa del Rey Final|final]] of the [[Copa del Rey]], losing to [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], and the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], losing in extra time to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. During his tenure as successor to [[Bernd Schuster]], he brought in a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football to the club, bringing back memories of Laudrup as a player. His team, which was not one of the established powers in Spanish football, enjoyed comparative success. However, he spent only one season as manager, resigning in May 2008.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Politiken]]|language=da|date=16 May 2008|access-date=17 May 2008|url=http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article509942.ece|title=Laudrup: Jeg stopper i Getafe|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517035743/http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article509942.ece|archive-date=17 May 2008}}</ref>

After Laudrup announced his departure from Getafe, he was linked with jobs at Barcelona,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/au/news/getafe-owner-reveals-barcelona-wanted-laudrup-guardiola |title=Getafe owner reveals Barcelona wanted Laudrup before Guardiola |work=FourFourTwo.com.au |date=28 October 2013 |access-date=12 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512232348/http://www.fourfourtwo.com/au/news/getafe-owner-reveals-barcelona-wanted-laudrup-guardiola |archive-date=12 May 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Valencia, [[S.L.

He almost got the job at Panathinaikos, but according to Danish media, he wanted an option to allow him to leave if he received an offer from a Spanish club. This request was not accepted by the Greeks, who chose to hire [[Henk ten Cate]] instead.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Politiken]]|language=da|date=6 June 2008|access-date=6 June 2008|url=http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article519842.ece|title=Grækere afviste Laudrups kattelem|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607121942/http://politiken.dk/fodbold/article519842.ece|archive-date=7 June 2008}}</ref>

===Spartak Moscow===
On 12 September 2008, it was officially announced that Laudrup had signed a one-and-a-half-year contract to manage [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]], replacing Stanislav Cherchesov following his dismissal after a string of poor results.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/07/spartakmoscow.europeanfootball|title= Spartak turn to Laudrup|work= The Guardian|date= 12 September 2008}}</ref> However, Laudrup started on a poor note, winning just one of his first four league matches. He was subsequently sacked on 15 April 2009, just seven months on the job,<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/5164518/Michael-Laudrup-sacked-by-Spartak-Moscow.html Michael Laudrup sacked by Spartak Moscow], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 16 April 2009.</ref> in the wake of Spartak's quarter-final 3–0 loss to [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]] in the [[Russian Cup (football)|Russian Cup]]. The official statement from Spartak read: "From this point onwards, head coach Michael Laudrup has been relieved of his responsibilities because of unsatisfactory results."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/spartak-moscow-fires-coach-michael-laudrup-1.779461|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200917221028/https://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2009/04/16/sp-laudrup.html|url-status=live|archive-date=17 September 2020|title= Spartak Moscow fires coach Michael Laudrup|publisher= CBC News|date= 16 April 2009}}</ref>

On 22 October 2009, Spanish media announced Laudrup would be appointed as new manager of Spanish side [[Atlético Madrid]], replacing the short and unsuccessful run of [[Abel Resino]], following Atlético's 4–0 [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group D|UEFA Champions League group stage]] defeat to Chelsea. However, Laudrup and Atlético were not able to agree on terms and the deal fell apart. The day after, on 23 October, Resino was sacked and [[Quique Sánchez Flores]] was appointed as coach as the side's second-choice.

===Mallorca===
In July 2010, Laudrup was appointed manager of [[RCD Mallorca|Mallorca]] on a contract lasting until the end of June 2012. In his first season, he kept the struggling Mallorca side from relegation, which was suffering from losing many first team players and who was ejected from the UEFA Europa League due to its poor financial situation. At the beginning of the [[2011–12 La Liga|2011–12 season]], on 27 September 2011, Laudrup resigned as manager following the firing of his assistant, Erik Larsen. Laudrup cited great frustration with [[Lorenzo Serra Ferrer]], the club's director of football, leading to a bad work climate as the main reason for his resignation.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Bold.dk]]|language=da|date=27 September 2011|access-date=27 September 2011|url=http://www.bold.dk/nyt/Laudrup-Uudholdeligt-arbejdsklima |title=Uudholdeligt arbejdsklima}}</ref>

===Swansea City===
On 15 June 2012, Laudrup was appointed manager of [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] on a two-year contract, becoming the first Dane to manage in the [[Premier League]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/michael-laudrup-didnt-visit-swansea-905125|title=Taking a flyer: Swans boss Laudrup took job without visiting the place|date=21 June 2012|work=The Mirror}}</ref> He made several new signings after arriving at the [[Liberty Stadium]], including [[Michu]], [[Chico Flores]], [[Pablo Hernández (footballer, born 1985)|Pablo Hernández]], [[Jonathan de Guzmán]] and [[Ki Sung-yueng]].

==Style of management and tactics==
{{see also|4-2-3-1}}
As assistant manager to [[Morten Olsen]], the Denmark national team employed a [[Formation (association football)#4–2–3–1|4–2–3–1 system]] with pacey wingers playing the pivotal role in [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attack]]. Laudrup learnt from Olsen and used the same tactical style with Brøndby, with the team becoming more attacking and focused on a short passing style. He continued to employ a similar tactical style when he joined Getafe, ushering a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football to help the club to the Copa del Rey final. However, at Spartak Moscow, he could not adapt his formation and tactics to the Russian game, with the club unable to score enough goals ''per'' match.

As Mallorca manager, Laudrup inspired a team that lost a number of key players from relegation by playing an offensive game. In 2012, he joined Swansea City as manager, replacing [[Brendan Rodgers]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://thinkfootball.co.uk/archives/6885 | title = Tactical analysis: How have Swansea evolved under Laudrup? | work = Think Football | date = 14 December 2012 | access-date = 14 December 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121218015638/http://thinkfootball.co.uk/archives/6885 | archive-date = 18 December 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Under Rodgers, Swansea were known to play a [[Formation (association football)#4–3–3|4–3–3]] approach with a lot of focus on passing, where the full-backs pushed up when in possession and the outfield players played a high tempo pressing game. Under Laudrup, the team began employing a 4–2–3–1 formation, becoming more attacking while retaining the passing, possession, and pressing game. He also signed a number of new players, primarily from La Liga, trying to bring the attacking style from Spain to Wales, which saw more goals scored.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.just-football.com/2012/12/tactical-analysis-laudrups-swansea-vs-brendan-rodgers-changes/ | title = Tactical Analysis: Laudrup's Swansea to Brendan Rodgers'? |work=Just Football | date = 19 December 2012 | access-date = 19 December 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/soccer/swansea-soccer-team-seeks-save-from-incoming-us-coach-bradley/article32376277/ |title=Swansea soccer team seeks save from incoming U.S. coach, Bradley |work=The Globe and Mail |date=14 October 2016 |access-date=25 April 2024 }}</ref> He said, "You can get a lot of quality for a reasonable amount in Spain right now."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talksport.co.uk/magazine/features/130216/swanseas-michael-laudrup-perfect-manager-chelsea-and-heres-why-191678 |title=Swansea's Michael Laudrup is the perfect manager for Chelsea |work=talkSPORT |date=16 February 2013 |access-date=16 February 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Laudrup earned plaudits for maintaining their flowing, attacking brand of football and attractive, passing style of play throughout the season, which saw his side win the League Cup, after beating Bradford City a record 5–0 in the final. "You can't ask players to do things that [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and [[Lionel Messi]] are doing, but you can ask the easy things," he said. "Sometimes the easiest things in football, a simple pass five or eight yards, can be the most effective. That, everybody can learn."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/blog/_/name/relegationzone/id/102/michael-laudrups-swansea-style?cc=3888 |title=Michael Laudrup's Swansea style |work=ESPN Blog |date=30 August 2012 |access-date=30 August 2012}}</ref>

===Personal life===
Michael Laudrup is part of a family with three generations of footballers. His uncle was former Brøndby and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] manager [[Ebbe Skovdahl]].

===Politics and business===
Alongside his professional football career, Laudrup began importing Spanish wine to Denmark in 1993. Initially, the wine import was sort of a hobby, but business grew rapidly and today his company, Laudrup Vin og Gastronomi, has over ten employees, runs a Wine Academy and imports wines from all over the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laudrup.dk/infopages/historie_profil.asp|title=Historien bag Laudrup Vin – salg af kvalitetsvin siden 1993|website=laudrup.dk|access-date=20 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315102734/http://www.laudrup.dk/infopages/historie_profil.asp|archive-date=15 March 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>
