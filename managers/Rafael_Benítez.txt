'''Rafael Benítez Maudes''' (born 16 April 1960) is a Spanish professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Football player|player]]. He is currently the manager of [[Super League Greece]] club [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]].

Benítez joined [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]]'s coaching staff at the age of 26, going on to work as the under-19 and reserve team coach, and assistant manager for the senior team. He moved away from Real Madrid in 1995, but management spells at [[Real Valladolid]] and [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]] were short-lived and unsuccessful. He guided [[Segunda División]] club [[CF Extremadura|Extremadura]] back to [[La Liga]] in his first season in the [[1997–98 Segunda División|1997–98 season]], but the team was relegated the following season. He left the club, and coached [[CD Tenerife|Tenerife]] in 2000, winning promotion in [[2000–01 Segunda División|his only season]].

Benítez was appointed coach of [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] and won La Liga in the [[2001–02 La Liga|2001–02]] and [[2003–04 La Liga|2003–04]] seasons, with the [[2003–04 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] alongside the latter. After leaving Valencia, Benitez moved to English club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] of the Premier League, guiding the club to victory in the [[UEFA Champions League]] in [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final|2005]]. For the second consecutive season, he was named [[UEFA Club Football Awards#Coach(es) of the Year|UEFA Manager of the Year]]. He also won the [[FA Cup]] in [[2006 FA Cup final|2006]] and reached the [[2007 UEFA Champions League final|2007 Champions League final]], but was unable to win the Premier League, with Liverpool's best league performance under Benítez a second-place finish in [[2008–09 Premier League|2008–09]].

After leaving Liverpool in June 2010, Benítez was appointed manager of treble-winning side [[Inter Milan]]. Despite attaining silverware with the [[2010 Supercoppa Italiana|Supercoppa Italiana]] and [[2010 FIFA Club World Cup|Club World Cup]], his reign at the club was short, and he was dismissed midway through the [[2010–11 Serie A|2010–11 season]]. In November 2012, he was appointed interim manager of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for the remainder of the season, and he went on to win the [[2013 UEFA Europa League final|2013 Europa League]]. He returned to Italy in 2013 to coach [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], where he won the [[2013–14 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] and [[2014 Supercoppa Italiana|Supercoppa Italiana]]. He then left Napoli and became coach of Real Madrid in June 2015 on an initial three-year contract, lasting six months.

Benítez was appointed manager of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in March 2016. He was unable to avoid relegation, but earned promotion back to the Premier League by winning the [[EFL Championship|Championship]]. He left the club in June 2019, and joined [[Chinese Super League]] club [[Dalian Professional F.C.|Dalian Professional]]. He left the club by mutual consent in January 2021, before taking over as manager at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in June. He was dismissed in January 2022, and then managed [[RC Celta de Vigo|Celta Vigo]] in [[2023–24 La Liga|2023–24]].

==Early career==
Benítez played as a midfielder for both [[Real Madrid C|Real Madrid Aficionados]] in the [[Tercera División]] and [[Real Madrid Castilla]] in the [[Segunda División]]. He also enrolled as a student at INEF, the sports faculty at the [[Universidad Politécnica de Madrid]]; in 1982, he obtained a degree in physical education.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Emerging athlete and strategist|url=http://www.rafabenitez.com/web/in/background/biography/emerging-athlete-and-strategist/181/|access-date=5 October 2021|website=Rafa Benitez Official Website}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=McNamara|first=Paul|date=21 June 2021|title=Benitez On What He Can Prove At Everton|url=https://www.evertonfc.com/news/2190976/benitez-on-what-he-can-prove-at-everton|access-date=5 October 2021|website=www.evertonfc.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=30 June 2021|title=Rafael Benitez – an adopted Scouser from Red to Blue|url=https://www.itv.com/news/granada/2021-06-30/rafael-benitez-the-adopted-scouser-who-takes-over-at-everton|access-date=5 October 2021|website=ITV News}}</ref>

In 1979, Benítez was selected to play for the Spain Youth U-19s at the [[1979 Summer Universiade|World Student Games]] in [[Mexico City]], and he scored a penalty in the opening game, a 10–0 win against Cuba. In the next game, a 0–0 draw against Canada, he was injured in a hard tackle. The injury saw him sidelined for a year, and hampered his chances of becoming a major player. In 1981, Benítez joined [[Tercera División]] side [[AD Parla|Parla]]. Initially, he joined Parla on loan, but eventually signed for them permanently and helped them gain promotion to [[Segunda División B]]. He also played a further three games for the Spain Universities XI. In 1985, he signed for Segunda División B club [[Linares CF|Linares]] and under [[Enrique Mateos]], he served as a player/coach. Further injury problems saw him miss almost the entire 1985–86 season, and he subsequently retired as a player.<ref name=Bio>''Rafa Benítez'': Paco Lloret (2005)</ref>

==Managerial career==
===Real Madrid youth coach===
In 1986, at the age of 26, Benítez returned to [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] to join the club's coaching staff. At the start of the 1986–87 season, he was appointed coach of [[Real Madrid Castilla]]. With this team, he won two league titles in 1987 and 1989. He won a third league title with the Real Madrid youth in 1990. Halfway through the 1990–91 season, he succeeded [[José Antonio Camacho]] as the coach of Real Madrid's under-19 team. He won the [[Spain U-19 Cup|Spain Under 19s Cup]] in 1991 and 1993, defeating [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in both finals. In 1993, the team completed a [[double (association football)|double]] when they also won the [[División de Honor Juvenil de Fútbol|national under-19 league]]. While at Real, Benítez also gained his coaching certificate in 1989 – and in the summer of 1990, taught at a football camp at the [[University of California, Davis|University of California]] in [[Davis, California]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rafael Benitez – a complete profile of Liverpool FC manager Rafa Benitez|url=https://www.anfield-online.co.uk/squad/st_benitez.html|access-date=5 October 2021}}</ref>

During the 1992–93 season, Benítez also worked as an assistant coach to [[Mariano García Remón]] at Real Madrid B. After his success with the U19s, Benítez then succeeded García Remón at the start of the 1993–94 season. Real Madrid B were then playing in the [[Segunda División]], and on 4 September 1993, he made his debut as a Segunda División manager with a 3–1 over [[Hércules CF|Hércules]]. In March 1994, he became an assistant to [[Vicente del Bosque]] with the senior Real Madrid team, before returning to coach Real Madrid B for the 1994–95 season.<ref name=Bio/>

===Early coaching===
The first attempts by Benítez at senior management away from the Real Madrid fold were less than successful. He was appointed manager of [[Real Valladolid]] for the [[1995–96 La Liga|1995–96 season]], but was dismissed after only two wins in 23 games, with the club bottom of [[La Liga]]. During the [[1996–97 Segunda División|1996–97 season]], Benítez took charge at [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]] in the [[Segunda División]], but after only nine games and one win, he was dismissed. He did, however, meet the fitness instructor [[Pako Ayestarán]] at the club, and went on to form a partnership with him at several clubs for the next decade. In 1997, he joined another Segunda División side, [[CF Extremadura|Extremadura]], and this time led them to promotion, finishing second in the table behind [[Deportivo Alavés|Alavés]], after winning 23 out of 42 games. Extremadura only survived one season in La Liga, however, and were relegated in 1999, after finishing 17th and losing a play-off to [[Rayo Vallecano]].<ref name="early years">{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Mason |url=https://thesefootballtimes.co/2016/10/27/rafa-benitez-the-early-years-at-extremadura-and-tenerife/ |title=Rafa Benítez: the early years at Extremadura and Tenerife |publisher=These Football Times |date=27 October 2016 |access-date=19 February 2021}}</ref>

Benítez subsequently resigned at Extremadura, and took a year off from football to study in England and Italy. He also worked as a commentator/analyst for [[Eurosport]], [[Marca (newspaper)|''Marca'']], [[El Mundo (Spain)|''El Mundo'']] and local Madrid TV. In 2000, he was appointed manager of [[CD Tenerife|Tenerife]] of the Segunda División, and with a team that included [[Mista (footballer)|Mista]], [[Curro Torres]] and [[Luis García (footballer, born 1978)|Luis García]], he gained promotion to La Liga by finishing third in the league behind [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] and [[Real Betis]].<ref name="early years"/>

===Valencia===
====2001–04: Twice Spanish champions and UEFA Cup winners====
In 2001, Benítez was appointed coach of [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], replacing Argentine [[Héctor Cúper]]. Cúper had led the club to two consecutive [[UEFA Champions League]] finals (both of which they lost), and departed to join Italian side [[Inter Milan]]. Valencia had previously approached [[Javier Irureta]], [[Mané (football manager)|Mané]] and [[Luis Aragonés]], and had been turned down by all three. However, club director Javier Subirats recognised the potential of Benítez, and campaigned for his appointment. According to [[Santiago Cañizares]], the squad was initially surprised, but they were immediately won over by his modesty as he presented himself as quoted: "You come from [[2001 UEFA Champions League final|the Champions League final]] and I come from Segunda División, but humbly I think I have tools to make you improve".<ref>[https://www.marca.com/futbol/valencia/2021/04/27/6088699e22601df82f8b4586.html Cañizares explica a Casillas por qué Albelda "hinchó de leches" a Zidane en su debut: "Tenía que saber a quién se enfrentaba"]. [[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]], 27 April 2021</ref> Shortly after his signing was announced in June 2001, Valencia president Pedro Cortes claimed that, "we believe he's the ideal coach. He's a professional who is highly qualified to take charge of the sort of team we want — young, aggressive and with a winning attitude."<ref name="bbc01">{{Cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/1371448.stm|title=Benitez takes over as Valencia boss|date=5 June 2001|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Benitez signed a two-year deal, with an annual salary of €450,000.<ref name="bbc01"/> It was well below the €1.2 million Cúper had earnt the previous season.<ref name="bbc01"/>

Valencia fans also were soon won over by Benítez, after he introduced a more attacking style of play than his predecessor. He also brought in both [[Mista (footballer)|Mista]] from his former club and [[Francisco Rufete]] from [[Málaga CF|Málaga]], with Mista going on to become top goalscorer for Valencia, with 19 goals in the [[2003–04 La Liga|2003–04 season]]. In 2002, these tactics saw Benítez lead Valencia to their first La Liga title in 31 years, winning it by a seven-point margin over second-placed [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elartedf.com/rafa-benitezs-valencia-2001-2004/|last=Hrishikesh|first=Dabir|title=Remembering Rafa Benitez's Valencia Side That Took Spain By Storm|website=El Arte Del Futbol|date=5 June 2019|access-date=19 February 2021|archive-date=28 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210128060235/https://www.elartedf.com/rafa-benitezs-valencia-2001-2004/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

However, the following [[2002–03 La Liga|season]] was a disappointing one; the club failed to follow up on their title success, finishing 18 points behind champions Real Madrid, and missed out on the top four by a single point. The season also saw Benítez make his debut in the [[2002–03 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], where his side reached the quarter-finals, losing to Inter Milan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/champions_league/2959001.stm|title=Inter edge past Valencia|date=22 April 2003|access-date=7 October 2024|work=[[BBC Sport]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230723171810/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/champions_league/2959001.stm|archive-date=23 July 2023|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the [[2003–04 La Liga|2003–04 season]], Valencia won La Liga with three games to spare, and beat [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] 2–0 in the [[2004 UEFA Cup final|UEFA Cup final]]. Despite this success, Benítez fell out with [[Jesús García Pitarch]], the club's [[director of football]], over control of new signings, and the club's failure to reinforce the squad with the players he wanted. He said: "I was hoping for a sofa [a defender] and they've brought me a lamp [[Fabián Canobbio|[Fabián Canobbio]]]," in reference to the [[Association football positions|positions]] he wanted to be strengthened.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lasprovincias.es/prensa/20070604/deportes/todo-empezo-sofa-lampara_20070604.html|title=Todo empezó con el sofá y la lámpara|trans-title=Everything started with the sofa and the lamp|newspaper=Las Provincias|date=4 June 2007|language=es}}</ref> These differences of opinion saw Benítez resign as Valencia coach on 1 June 2004.<ref name="Benitez quits Valencia">{{cite news |title=Benitez quits Valencia |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/3765515.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 June 2004 |access-date=1 April 2017}}</ref>

===Liverpool===
On 16 June 2004, Benítez was appointed manager of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], replacing [[Gérard Houllier]], becoming the first Spaniard to manage in the [[Premier League]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Emery joins growing band of Spanish managers|url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/692820|access-date=5 October 2021|website=www.premierleague.com |date=24 May 2018 }}</ref> On his arrival he stated: "It is like a dream to be here.

====2004–06: Early successes====
[[File:Rafael Benitez.JPG|thumb|Benítez managing [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 2005, his first season at the club]]

One of Benítez's first tasks at Liverpool was to convince club captain [[Steven Gerrard]] not to move to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Dominic |last=Fifield |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jun/29/newsstory.sport2 |title=Benítez boost as Gerrard stays at Liverpool |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 June 2004 |access-date=26 April 2010 |location=London }}</ref> He was unable, however, to convince [[Michael Owen]] to extend his contract; he was subsequently sold to Real Madrid. Later in the summer transfer window, Benítez signed several players from La Liga, most notably Luis García and [[Xabi Alonso]].

During his first season, Benítez was unable to improve Liverpool's form in the Premier League. Key players missed much of the season through injury, and Liverpool failed to challenge Chelsea and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for the league title, finishing fifth. Benítez, however, did reach his first English domestic cup final, losing the [[2005 Football League Cup final|League Cup final]] against Chelsea at the [[Millennium Stadium]] 3–2 after extra time.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/feb/27/minutebyminute.carlingcup0405 |title=Chelsea 3 Liverpool 2 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=27 February 2005 |access-date=6 June 2015 |first=Paul |last=Doyle }}</ref>

In the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], Liverpool were minutes away from going out of the competition in the group stages. However, an 87th-minute goal by Steven Gerrard defeated [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] 3–1, and saw the club progress to the last 16 on head-to-head difference. After defeating [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] and [[Juventus FC|Juventus]], Liverpool faced Chelsea in the semi-final. A controversial early goal in the second leg from Luis García saw Liverpool win 1–0 on aggregate and reach [[2005 UEFA Champions League final|the final]] against [[AC Milan|Milan]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Nick|url=http://www.overcast.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/lfc/garcia-gallas.htm|title=Motion expert says Garcia's shot did cross the line|newspaper=The Independent|date=5 May 2005|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120909204517/http://www.overcast.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/lfc/garcia-gallas.htm|archive-date=9 September 2012}}</ref>

In a classic final, dubbed the ''Miracle of Istanbul'', Liverpool came from 3–0 down at half time to level the score at 3–3 in the space of just six minutes, eventually triumphing 3–2 on penalties with the assistance of goalkeeper [[Jerzy Dudek]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/6653607/Top-20-sporting-moments-of-the-decade-Liverpools-Miracle-of-Istanbul.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/6653607/Top-20-sporting-moments-of-the-decade-Liverpools-Miracle-of-Istanbul.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Top 20 sporting moments of the decade: Liverpool's 'Miracle of Istanbul'|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 December 2009|access-date=8 July 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Benítez's calm, methodical approach at half time was said to give the players the belief they could pull off an improbable comeback, and win Liverpool an historic fifth European Cup.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lipton|first=Martin |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2005/11/09/benitez-uncovered-inside-the-dressing-room-on-that-amazing-night-in-istanbul-115875-16348116/ |title=Benitez Uncovered: Inside The Dressing Room On That Amazing Night In Istanbul |newspaper=Daily Mirror |date=9 November 2005 |access-date=26 April 2010}}</ref> In doing so, Benítez became only the third manager in history (after [[Bob Paisley]] and [[José Mourinho]]) to win the UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League in successive seasons, and the second Liverpool manager (after [[Joe Fagan]]) ever to win the UEFA Champions League/European Cup in his first season in charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/185744-lfc-v-milan-2005-a-text-commentary|title=LFC v Milan 2005: A text commentary |publisher=Liverpool FC|date=23 May 2015|access-date=26 May 2015}}</ref>	

Dudek's performance in the final was not enough for him to stay as first-choice goalkeeper, as newly signed [[Pepe Reina]] replaced him in from the start of the 2005–06 season. Benítez also quickly discarded [[Vladimír Šmicer]] and [[Igor Bišćan]], who played key roles in the European success. Benítez also quickly sold [[Josemi]] and [[Antonio Núñez (footballer)|Antonio Núñez]], two of his first signings in English football, after they failed to establish themselves, with the likes of [[Peter Crouch]], [[Mohamed Sissoko]], [[Daniel Agger]], as well as former Liverpool player [[Robbie Fowler]], being brought in to strengthen the side.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/577384-rafas-boys-how-successful-was-benitez-in-the-transfer-market|last=Cookson|first=Will|title=Rafa's Boys: How Successful Was Benitez in the Transfer Market?|website=Bleacher Report|date=18 January 2011|access-date=19 February 2021}}</ref>

Benítez's signings helped the club's Premier League form improve considerably. Liverpool finished third in the league, missing out on second place by one point. Liverpool also won the [[2006 FA Cup final|FA Cup]], beating both [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and Chelsea, as well as a thrilling 5–3 win against [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in the third round, on the way to the final against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. History repeated itself in the final, as they then went on to lift the trophy after a penalty shoot-out, following a dramatic 3–3 draw. Liverpool came from 2–0 down, and were losing 3–2 in stoppage time, when Steven Gerrard scored a dramatic late equalizer. This time, Pepe Reina saved three penalties during the shoot-out to secure the silverware.<ref name="Gerrard final"/>

====2006–08 Confrontation with new owners====
Following Benítez's great early success, the English media were predicting Liverpool would challenge Chelsea for the [[2006–07 Premier League]] title after Benítez addressed Liverpool's perceived weaknesses in the transfer window, a belief reaffirmed after his side won the [[FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] with a 2–1 victory over Chelsea. The title challenge, however, fizzled out early in the season, with Liverpool's poor form away from [[Anfield]] leading to speculation Benítez's tenure at Liverpool was short-lived, with his agent quoted as saying Benítez would consider offers to manage in Italy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/6131858.stm|title=Liverpool dismiss Benitez report|publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 November 2006|access-date =7 November 2008}}</ref> Benítez swiftly issued a statement through the club's website, re-affirming his desire to remain with Liverpool for the long-term.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/archivedirs/news/2006/nov/10/N154044061110-1426.htm|title=Rafa: My agent was misquoted|publisher=Liverpool FC|date=11 November 2006|access-date =7 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214230708/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/archivedirs/news/2006/nov/10/N154044061110-1426.htm|archive-date=14 December 2007}}</ref>

Supporters and manager joined to welcome new owners [[George N. Gillett Jr.|George Gillett]] and [[Tom Hicks]], with the hope the new owners would bring funding for new players and a new stadium. Gillett declared himself delighted with the manager of his new investment, as Benítez overcame his domestic difficulties to lead Liverpool to another [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|Champions League final]]. After Liverpool again defeated Chelsea in the semi-final, this time on penalties, Gillett stated, "Rafa has been tremendous ... We knew of him but I don't think we realized how good he was, and not just as a coach. Not only was he a brilliant coach but he is a very sharp, savvy businessman. He knows what he wants and how to get it. The more we have seen of him the more impressed we have become."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/gillett-blown-away-by-rafa-brilliance |title=Gillett Blown Away By Rafa Brilliance |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402152846/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/gillett-blown-away-by-rafa-brilliance |archive-date=2 April 2015 }}</ref> Benítez did not reciprocate his owner's kind words, demanding that his club's new owners back him in the transfer market in order for Liverpool to progress following his side's 2–1 loss to Milan in the final.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/6686935.stm|title=We must spend big, says Benitez|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 May 2007|access-date =7 November 2008}}</ref> It was reported Benítez did not feel he had the complete support of the new owners, a thought that was compounded by Liverpool's initial lack of activity in the transfer window, although the club played these rumours down.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/6696155.stm|title=Parry plays down Benitez reports|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 May 2007|access-date =7 November 2008}}</ref>

Benítez's spending was, eventually, significant, breaking Liverpool's transfer record when signing Spanish striker [[Fernando Torres]] from [[Atlético Madrid]], as well as signing [[Ryan Babel]], [[Yossi Benayoun]], [[Lucas Leiva]] and [[Andriy Voronin]]. Among those Benítez sold was [[Craig Bellamy]], who was notably phased out of the first team, following an altercation with [[John Arne Riise]] in the buildup to Liverpool's remarkable victory over Barcelona in the [[Camp Nou]] en route to the Champions League final.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/19/newsstory.sport3|title=Bellamy faces uncertain future as Liverpool reel from golf club attack|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 February 2007|access-date=22 February 2007|location=London|first=Louise|last=Taylor}}</ref>

Liverpool made a good start to the [[2007–08 Liverpool F.C. season|2007–08 season]], topping the Premier League table for the first time under Benítez, after a comprehensive 6–0 win over [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. Despite this, poor results in the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and a disagreement over future transfers lead to a public falling-out with the club's owners, which played out in the media at the end of November. It was suggested that Benítez's position was now under serious threat. The resulting coverage resulted in a show of support by fans in support of Benítez which culminated in a fans' march in support of Benítez ahead of the critical Champions League home tie with [[FC Porto|Porto]], which they won 4–1.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/liverpool/article2957557.ece |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604144337/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/liverpool/article2957557.ece |archive-date=4 June 2011 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |location=London |title=Rafael Bentez calls temporary truce as fans plan show of solidarity |first=Oliver |last=Kay |date=28 November 2007 |access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref> It later emerged that [[Jürgen Klinsmann]] had been offered Benítez's job before eventually accepting the post of [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] manager.

Benítez was unable to win any trophies as Liverpool's domestic campaign falter in the winter months – including a shock FA Cup exit at home to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], with his side losing to Chelsea in the Champions League semi-finals. Despite the lack of silverware, the main talking points were off the pitch, with Benítez in the middle of a power struggle with the Liverpool board.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/7344027.stm |title=Benitez urges his squad to focus |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 April 2008 |access-date=26 April 2010}}</ref>

====2008–09: League runner-up====
In a sign of the increasingly strained relationship between the Liverpool manager and his board, Benítez was reportedly close to quitting Liverpool in the summer of 2008 over the board's failure to back him in his bid to purchase [[Gareth Barry]] from [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/8/main/2008/08/16/821434/rafa-laughs-at-quit-reports|title=Rafa Laughs At Quit Reports|first=Gill|last=Clark|website=goal.com|date=16 August 2008|access-date=4 March 2009}}</ref> Benítez had reportedly intended to sell Xabi Alonso to fund the purchase of Barry, but Liverpool CEO [[Rick Parry]] was reported to have prioritised signing [[Robbie Keane]] over Barry, causing tension when Barry did not arrive.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport-old/football/2008/08/22/liverpool-boss-rafa-benitez-and-chief-exec-rick-parry-call-a-truce-115875-20707104|title=Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez and chief exec Rick Parry call a truce|first=David|last=Maddock|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=22 August 2008|access-date=4 March 2009}}</ref> Striker Keane was later re-sold back to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the January transfer window, with some analysts claiming he was a "pawn in a power struggle" between Benítez and the club's owners.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/columnists/reade/2009/01/31/never-walk-alone-liverpool-chiefs-are-pulling-in-different-directions-115875-21084536/|title=Never Walk Alone?

Liverpool finished the calendar year top of the Premier League for the first time since 1996.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

However, Liverpool's poor results in the New Year led to a sharper focus on Benítez, who had missed Liverpool's draw at Arsenal in December due to an operation to remove [[kidney stones]]. An infamous attack on Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] in the media led some pundits and opposition supporters to suggest Benítez was "cracking up" under the pressure of a title bid. Benítez still appeared to be at odds with Liverpool's owners, publicly turning down a contract extension and demanding more control over transfers. At one point, rumours of Benítez quitting or being dismissed became so great that bookmakers had to suspend betting on the subject.<ref name=betting1>{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=622304&sec=england&cc=5901|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228041647/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=622304&sec=england&cc=5901|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 February 2009|title=Liverpool brand Benítez exit talk as "ridiculous"|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=25 February 2009|access-date=25 February 2009}}</ref>

Nevertheless, on 18 March 2009, shortly after registering a 4–0 victory over Real Madrid and 4–1 victory over Manchester United, Benítez signed a new five-year deal with the club.

Prior to Benítez's final season at Liverpool, [[Xabi Alonso]], one of the key members of Benítez's squad, was sold to Real Madrid following a lengthy pursuit in a deal reportedly worth £30&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/5973196/Xabi-Alonso-completes-Real-Madrid-move.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/5973196/Xabi-Alonso-completes-Real-Madrid-move.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Xabi Alonso completes Real Madrid move|first=Rory|last=Smith|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 August 2009|access-date=1 August 2014|location=London}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Alonso said that Benítez's attempts to sell him the previous summer were a deciding factor in his move.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2009/09/03/xabi-alonso-i-decided-to-leave-liverpool-fc-after-club-s-move-for-gareth-barry-100252-24596192/ |title=Xabi Alonso: I decided to leave Liverpool FC after club's move for Gareth Barry |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |access-date=26 April 2010}}</ref> Alonso was immediately replaced in the squad by Italian midfielder [[Alberto Aquilani]], signed from [[A.S.

On 10 June 2010, and only a few days after leaving Liverpool, Benítez agreed a deal to become the new head coach of [[Serie A]] and reigning [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League|European champions]] [[Inter Milan]], taking over from José Mourinho, who had left to manage Real Madrid.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.inter.it/aas/news/reader?N=34021&L=en|title=Rafael Benitez, welcome to Inter!|date=10 June 2010|access-date=13 June 2010|publisher=FC Internazionale Milano|archive-date=13 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613000540/http://www.inter.it/aas/news/reader?N=34021&L=en|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 15 June 2010, Benítez was presented to the Italian media for the first time, after signing a two-year deal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8741240.stm|title=Rafael Benitez targets success at new club Inter Milan. |date=15 June 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=15 June 2010}}</ref>

==Relations with other managers==
[[Image:Zola & Benitez Upton Park 09May09.jpg|thumb|Benítez and [[West Ham United]] manager [[Gianfranco Zola]] in 2009]]

Benítez has had confrontations with both José Mourinho (Chelsea manager from 2004 to 2007) and Manchester United's Sir Alex Ferguson during his time in English football. Benítez made a number of suggestions during Mourinho's tenure as manager that [[Roman Abramovich]]'s money had bought Chelsea's success, and the pair refused to shake hands after some matches (although Mourinho declared the feud to be over after a league game in 2006). When Mourinho exited Chelsea in 2007, Benítez said, "You know my relationship with him, it is better that I do not say anything", declining to comment as Ferguson and Arsenal manager [[Arsène Wenger]] had.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/5353884.stm|title=Mourinho accepts Ballack red card|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 September 2006|access-date=9 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/7006330.stm|title=Ferguson pays tribute to Mourinho|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 September 2007|access-date=9 January 2009}}</ref>

On 9 January 2009, Benítez delivered a controversial appraisal of certain aspects of Sir Alex Ferguson's tenure, accusing Ferguson and Manchester United of being nervous because Liverpool were at the top of the league,<ref name=rafarant>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jan/09/rafael-benitez-alex-ferguson-outburst |title=The full transcript of Rafael Benítez's rant at Sir Alex Ferguson |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=1 August 2014 |location=London}}</ref> then accused the Manchester United manager of not being punished for breaking [[The Football Association|FA]] rules, suggesting he was "the only manager in the league that cannot be punished for these things",<ref name="rafarant"/> referring to Ferguson not being punished following an FA charge for comments he made about officials [[Martin Atkinson]] and [[Keith Hackett]] following an [[FA Cup]] tie with [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].<ref name=fergpompey>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/mar/09/newsstory.sport7 |title=FA will review Ferguson's criticisms of Atkinson and Hackett |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=18 March 2009 |location=London |first=Nicky |last=Bandini |date=9 March 2008}}</ref> In his 2013 autobiography, Ferguson said that "Benitez bought badly and made the feud personal".{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Benítez has also had confrontations with [[Sam Allardyce]] when he was manager of Newcastle United and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. When Allardyce was manager of Newcastle, he suggested Benítez would have been dismissed had Liverpool's European form been as bad as their league form.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/john-aldridge-slams-newcastle-boss-3503957|title=John Aldridge slams Newcastle boss Sam Allardyce after Rafa Benitez attack|last=Prentice|first=David|date=18 September 2007|newspaper=Liverpool Echo}}</ref> In a match in April 2009 when Allardyce was manager of Blackburn, he accused Benítez of arrogance over a gesture he made when Fernando Torres scored Liverpool's second goal. Allardyce suggested that Benítez had signalled the game was over despite Liverpool only having a two-goal lead. This view was later supported by Sir Alex Ferguson. Benítez, however, later explained this gesture: he said he had previously told Xabi Alonso to take a short free-kick. This instruction was ignored, which resulted in a goal. Benítez said that he had jokingly signalled to Alonso to ignore his instructions and not that he thought the game was effectively over.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/blackburn_rovers/8563092.stm|title=Blackburn boss Sam Allardyce steps up Benitez criticism |date=11 March 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=30 September 2010}}</ref>

==Management style==

Benítez developed a reputation in English football as a hard man to please, with former Liverpool captain [[Steven Gerrard]] admitting he longed for a "well done" from Benítez after good performances.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Rory |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/5286966/Steven-Gerrard-lavishes-praise-on-Rafael-Benitezs-winning-mentality.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/5286966/Steven-Gerrard-lavishes-praise-on-Rafael-Benitezs-winning-mentality.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Steven Gerrard lavishes praise on Rafael Benitez's 'winning mentality' |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=7 May 2009 |access-date=1 August 2014 |location=London}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Benítez's ruthlessness can also be seen in the way he disposed of all but Gerrard and [[Jamie Carragher]] from his Champions League winning squad within four seasons, with penalty shoot-out hero [[Jerzy Dudek]] made back-up goalkeeper the very season after the European triumph.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/blogs/mirror-football-blog/Was-Rafa-Benitez-right-to-sell-all-but-TWO-of-Liverpool-s-2005-Champions-League-winning-squad-article97701.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010163305/http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/blogs/mirror-football-blog/Was-Rafa-Benitez-right-to-sell-all-but-TWO-of-Liverpool-s-2005-Champions-League-winning-squad-article97701.html |archive-date=10 October 2012 |title=Was Rafa Benitez right to sell all but TWO of Liverpool's 2005 Champions League winning squad? |newspaper=Daily Mirror |access-date=26 April 2010}}</ref>

Benítez is a firm believer in [[squad rotation system|squad rotation]] and [[zonal marking]]. Despite heavy criticism from the English press<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams |first=Richard |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2006/sep/26/thecultofpermanentrotation |title=The cult of permanent rotation blights Benítez's bid for title |newspaper=The Guardian |date=26 September 2006 |access-date=26 April 2010 |location=London}}</ref> Benítez persisted with the reward of a Champions League and FA Cup triumph in his first two seasons. Benítez argued he needed to rotate his small squad to ensure key players were fit for the latter stages of these knockout competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=929739.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210234940/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=929739.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 February 2009 |title=Benitez opens doors to rotation |publisher=FIFA |date=30 October 2008 |access-date=26 April 2010}}</ref>

The tactic of zonal marking was criticised by pundits when Liverpool conceded from set-pieces<ref>{{cite news|last=Howe |first=Don |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/5131199/Liverpools-demise-against-Chelsea-the-fault-of-Rafael-Benitezs-zonal-marking.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/5131199/Liverpools-demise-against-Chelsea-the-fault-of-Rafael-Benitezs-zonal-marking.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Liverpool's demise against Chelsea the fault of Rafael Benitez's zonal marking |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=9 April 2009 |access-date=1 August 2014 |location=London}}{{cbignore}}</ref> in spite of the fact that Benítez's squads are usually renowned for their defensive nature and low number of goals scored against them.

Benítez instigated a host of backroom changes at the end of the [[2008–09 Liverpool F.C. season|2008–09 season]] to improve the club's youth development, including the appointment of club legend [[Kenny Dalglish]] in a senior role at the academy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Prentice|first=David |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2009/07/04/kenny-dalglish-rejoins-liverpool-fc-100252-24069334/ |title=Kenny Dalglish rejoins Liverpool FC |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |access-date=26 April 2010}}</ref>
