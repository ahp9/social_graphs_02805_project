==Career==

===Israel===
Grant's professional coaching career started at age 18, in 1972, as youth coach of his home-town team, [[Hapoel Petah Tikva F.C.|Hapoel Petah Tikva]]. In 1986, after a 14-year spell in this job, he was promoted to first team coach, leading the club to two [[Toto Cup]] victories, in 1990 and 1991, thus bringing Hapoel Petah Tikva back to the top of Israeli football after nearly 25 years.  During this era Petah Tikva fought regularly for the championship against [[Shlomo Scharf]]'s [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]]. In his last season in Petah Tikva, Grant lost both the championship and the [[Israel State Cup]] within 3 days to Maccabi Haifa, in a chain of events which is commonly known in Israel as "[[Double (association football)|the Double]] robbery".<ref name="The double robbery">{{cite news
| title = A history of matches between Hapoel Petah Tikva and Maccabi Haifa

The next year the club won its first major title in 30 years, by winning its second-ever [[Israeli Football State Cup|Israeli Cup]].

The following season Grant moved to coach [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]] winning [[Liga Leumit]] (then the top division) in his first season with them, with a 13-point advantage over the second place team. Maccabi Tel Aviv lost out closely in the final of the Israeli Cup and was thus denied a historic double. The cup was won by Maccabi Tel Aviv under Grant's control, however, in 1994, followed with another championship in 1995.

Following this, Grant moved to [[Hapoel Haifa F.C.|Hapoel Haifa]] for what has been described as a short and unsuccessful spell, finishing fourth in the Israeli championship. Grant returned to Maccabi Tel Aviv between 1997 and 2000, although this period was less successful than his previous one at the club, winning just the Toto Cup in 1999.

Grant moved to [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]] in 2000, where he coached until 2002. There, he led the team to great success, winning the [[Israeli Premier League]] in 2001 and 2002, as well as the Toto Cup in 2002, whilst narrowly missing out on the Israeli Cup, to miss winning the treble. In 2001 the club participated in the 2nd qualifying round of the [[UEFA Champions League]] competition against the Finnish team [[FC Haka]]. Despite winning both legs (1–0 and 4–0) with an aggregate score of 5–0 the club did not progress further. The use of [[Walid Badir]] as a substitute in the final ten minutes of the second leg while under suspension caused disqualification on the grounds of "culpable negligence" and FC Haka proceeded to the next round against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/1471169.stm Liverpool opponents expelled] BBC Sport</ref>

====Israeli national team====
After leaving Haifa in 2002, Grant became the youngest team coach of [[Israel national football team|Israel]], replacing the former [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] coach [[Richard Møller Nielsen]]. The team participated in Group 1 of the [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying]] round but finished third and so did not take part in the finals in Portugal.

Although not qualifying for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], Israel finished third in their [[Football World Cup 2006 (qualification)|qualifying]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 4|group]] behind winners [[France national football team|France]] and runners-up [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. Israel missed on qualification to the finals, despite remaining undefeated in the group with four wins and six draws.

====Management style====
Grant is known in Israel for giving a chance to young players in almost every club he coached, such as [[Alon Hazan]] and goalkeeper Raffi Cohen at Petah Tikva, [[Avi Nimni]] and [[Itzik Zohar]] at Maccabi Tel Aviv, [[Gal Alberman]] in the Israeli team, and many more. Grant famously did not include Israeli star [[Eyal Berkovic]] in the national squad during 2005, saying he wanted to create "a younger team", but, nonetheless, retaining 34-year-old [[Avi Nimni]]. In 2007, Berkovic described the way Grant became Chelsea's manager as "disgusting" and "disrespectful".<ref name="Berkovic Grant">{{cite news

Grant, as is also the case with another coach from Petah Tikva, past Israel coach [[Dror Kashtan]], is considered one of the most successful Israeli coaches. He has a reputation of a lucky winner in Israel, which caused the invention of the frequently used humorous term 'Hatachat shel Avram'. This means 'Avram's [[Buttocks|Ass]]', a reference to the allegedly large amount of luck Grant enjoyed during the 2006 World Cup campaign.<ref name="Grant's arse">{{cite news

Congolese forward [[Lomana LuaLua]], presently with [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] of the English Premier League, stated that it was Grant's encouragement and emotional support that kept him from ending his career after the loss of his son Yoshuha to [[pneumonia]]. Grant was director of football at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] during LuaLua's stint at the club.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===England===
In October 2005, Grant announced that he would step down from the national team as his contract was due to expire in June of the following year. Subsequently, he took up the position of Technical Director at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in June 2006, overseeing [[Harry Redknapp]]'s side.

Several unnamed Chelsea players were quoted as saying Grant's methods were "25 years behind the times" and "Chelsea deserve a bigger coach than him. Grant does not have the quality to coach a team like this. When we play big opponents we will suffer because of him."

Grant faced his first game only 3 days after taking up the manager's role, losing 2–0 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 24 September. At his first [[UEFA Champions League]] match as a coach (with Chelsea and in general) he led Chelsea to a 2–1 away win over [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], replicating one of Mourinho's most celebrated wins.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6534987.stm|title=Valencia 1-2 Chelsea (agg 2-3)|date=10 April 2007|access-date=3 January 2020|work=BBC News}}</ref> Chelsea went on to register a 16-game unbeaten run under Grant, including beating Manchester City 6–0 in one of Chelsea's biggest wins.  Subsequently, Grant was offered and signed a four-year contract with Chelsea in December 2007.<ref>{{cite news

In January 2008, [[Nicolas Anelka]] from [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], [[Branislav Ivanović]] from [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]], and [[Franco Di Santo]] from [[Audax Club Sportivo Italiano|Audax Italiano]] were added to Grant's Chelsea squad.

In February, Chelsea reached the [[2008 Football League Cup Final|2008 League Cup Final]], their first competition final under Grant's management. They lost 2–1 to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 24 February, with an extra time winner from centre-back [[Jonathan Woodgate]].<ref name="lg08">{{cite news|last=Stevenson|first=Jonathan|title=Tottenham 2-1 Chelsea|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7256729.stm|access-date=16 November 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=24 February 2008}}</ref> On 8 March, at [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], Chelsea were eliminated from the [[FA Cup]] 1–0. On 23 March, Grant secured his first win against one of the other big four clubs when Chelsea came from behind after two substitutions that were ridiculed by Chelsea fans to beat [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] 2–1. On 26 April, Grant got his second big win when Chelsea beat Manchester United 2–1, to move Chelsea into second place in the [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] level on points with first place [[Manchester United]] with two games remaining in the season. They eventually finished the season in second place, as the team had done the previous year.<ref name="pl08">{{cite news|title=Grant gracious after title blow|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7395137.stm|access-date=16 November 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=11 May 2008}}</ref>

Grant was chosen as [[Premier League Manager of the Month]] in April in his first season as Chelsea's manager.

On 30 April 2008, Grant's Chelsea beat [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] 3–2 (4–3 on aggregate) to advance to the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final]], something they failed to achieve under former manager José Mourinho. Chelsea drew 1–1 with [[Manchester United]] in the final, only to lose out on the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]] in a penalty shootout which United won 6–5. In the heavy rain, [[John Terry]] slipped on his team's fifth penalty, clipping the ball off the post and wide. Had he scored, Chelsea would have won the tournament.<ref name="ec08">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/7419271.stm|title=Penalty miss will haunt me forever, says distraught Terry|date=25 May 2008|agency=Reuters|access-date=6 February 2010}}</ref>

On 7 October 2009, Grant returned to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] as their new [[Director of football]], following the purchase of the club by [[Ali al-Faraj]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/8295129.stm|title=Grant seals return to Portsmouth |date=7 October 2009|work=BBC Sport|access-date=7 October 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091008101633/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/8295129.stm| archive-date= 8 October 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> On 26 November 2009, following the release of [[Paul Hart]], Grant was confirmed as the new manager of the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/News/Grant-To-Be-Boss.aspx |title=Grant to be boss |work=Portsmouth F.C. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129081359/http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/News/Grant-To-Be-Boss.aspx |archive-date=29 November 2009}}</ref> His first game as manager was a 4–1 defeat at home to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 28 November 2009.

On 20 May 2010, Grant resigned as the manager of Portsmouth. He announced his decision to leave in an open letter to fans on the club's website, stating that "it was the hardest decision I have ever had to make". He went on to say that Portsmouth's fans had brought tears to his eyes with their loyalty, devotion and passion for the club.<ref name="BBCresign"/>

A dismal start to the [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11 season]] saw Grant come under fire after the Hammers had won just two Premier League games by the end of November and stood bottom of the table. However, there was some much needed cause for celebration on 30 November 2010 when his side beat [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 4–0 in the [[Football League Cup]] quarter-final. West Ham became the first side to beat [[Sir Alex Ferguson]]'s team in any competition this season, and were semi-finalists in the competition for the first time since the [[1989–90 in English football|1989–90 season]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_cup/9233755.stm|title=West Ham 4-0 Man United|date=30 November 2010|access-date=3 January 2020|work=BBC News}}</ref>

On 13 January 2012, [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]]'s board of directors announced in an official statement to the public that Avram Grant was named the new manager of the club.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sport.blic.rs/Fudbal/Domaci-fudbal/208593/Stanojevic-smenjen-Grant-i-zvanicno-trener-Partizana | location=Belgrade| work=Blic | title=Stanojević smenjen, Grant i zvanično trener Partizana!

This was due to the fact that the Iranian government does not recognise Israel as a country and refers to its government as the 'Zionist regime'. Grant's response was:

===NorthEast United===
Grant joined [[Indian Super League]] side [[NorthEast United FC]] as a technical advisor on 4 January 2018.  He was later promoted to Head Coach on 12 January 2018. The team won 2 out of the first 3 games under Grant, and Seiminlen Doungel scored the club's first ever hat-trick, but the team failed to win a single match after that, ending the season at the bottom of the league points table. Grant was the first head coach from an Asian country in the Indian Super League.
