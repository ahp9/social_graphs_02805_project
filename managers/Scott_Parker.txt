'''Scott Matthew Parker''' (born 13 October 1980) is an English professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former player who currently manages [[Premier League]] club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].

Parker began his career at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], and was loaned to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], before joining [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for a £10&nbsp;million fee in January 2004. He did not play regularly at Chelsea, and moved to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] the following year, where he was made captain. Parker joined [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in 2007, and was the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] for the 2010–11 season despite the club being relegated. He was then signed by [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and joined [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 2013. He would play 119 league matches for Fulham in both the Premier League and the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], before retiring at the end of the [[2016–17 Fulham F.C. season|2016–17 season]].

Parker has represented England at every level from [[England national under-16 football team|under-16]] to senior, making his full debut in 2003. Uniquely, he won his first four England caps while playing for four different clubs.<ref name=4clubs/> Parker was a member of the England team which reached the quarter-finals at [[UEFA Euro 2012]].

Parker was appointed [[caretaker manager]] of Fulham in February 2019, and hired on a permanent basis that summer. In his first season in charge, he guided them to promotion to the Premier League after winning the [[2020 English Football League play-offs#Championship|Championship play-offs]], but they were relegated back the following season. He then left to join [[AFC Bournemouth]] in 2021, and again won promotion from the Championship in his first season. After a [[Liverpool F.C. 9–0 AFC Bournemouth|9–0 loss]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the club's fourth league game of the season, he was dismissed, and then hired by [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]], from which he was sacked after 12 games in March 2023.

Parker's international debut for the senior England team came on 16 November 2003 when he came on in the 66th minute as a substitute replacing [[Wayne Rooney]] in a 3–2 defeat against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Players/P/Scott-Parker |title=Scott Parker |publisher=The Football Association |access-date=10 February 2011}}</ref>

His form earned him a place in the starting line-up for England's European Championships qualifier away to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 11 October 2006. In a 3–5–2 formation Parker was restricted to tracking back and covering due to the attacking players in the team like Frank Lampard and [[Steven Gerrard]]. England boss [[Steve McClaren]] specifically told Parker to chase the wingers and assist the two wing backs, [[Gary Neville]] and [[Ashley Cole]].
