'''David Thomas Bassett''' (born 4 September 1944 in [[Stanmore]]) is an English [[manager (association football)|football manager]] and a former player. Bassett won a total of seven promotions and is one of a select number of managers who took charge of over 1,000 matches.<ref name="LMA"/>

After a playing career at semi-professional level, Bassett took charge of Fourth Division [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in 1981, and led them to the First Division within five years; he resigned in 1987 after leading the Dons to 6th place in the top flight. Following a brief stint at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], he took over at [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], leading United to two consecutive promotions from 1988 to 1990. United remained in the top-flight until 1994, when they were relegated on the final day of the season. Bassett was sacked after a poor start to the 1994-95 season. Bassett next managed [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], losing in the First Division play-off final in 1996.

In 1997, Bassett was appointed general manager and assistant to [[Stuart Pearce]] at [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. When Forest were relegated, Bassett took over as manager, leading the club back to the Premier League as Division One champions in 1998. Bassett was sacked in December 1998 with Forest in the relegation zone. Bassett became manager of [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] in May 1999, and led them to the play-off final, which they lost to Ipswich Town. His last role as permanent manager was at [[Leicester City F.C.]], which ended in the Foxes' relegation in 2002. Subsequently, Bassett had roles as caretaker manager at Leicester City and Southampton and served as assistant manager to [[Dennis Wise]] at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].

==Playing career==
As a player Bassett was a defensive midfielder at semi-professional level, playing for [[Hayes F.C.|Hayes]] between 1961 and 1963, returning to the club on two occasions from 1964 to 1966 and 1968 to 1969. He also played for [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in 1963–64, for [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City]], where he made 11 appearances in the 1967–68 season and for [[Walton & Hersham F.C.|Walton & Hersham]] between 1969 and 1974,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://saintsstatistics.co.uk/saintsstats/player.php?id=528|title=St Albans City F.C. Statistics|website=saintsstatistics.co.uk|access-date=16 June 2019}}{{Dead link|date=April 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> where he was captain of the side that won the [[FA Amateur Cup]] in 1973. He was capped by England at [[England national amateur football team|amateur]] level.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.scottish-football-historical-archive.co.uk/Forgotten%20Glories.pdf |title=FORGOTTEN GLORIES – British Amateur Internationals 1901–1974 |last1=McColl |first1=Brian |last2=Gorman |first2=Douglas |page=288 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728161609/http://www.scottish-football-historical-archive.co.uk/Forgotten%20Glories.pdf |archive-date=28 July 2017 |url-status=dead |access-date=16 June 2019 |last3=Campbell |first3=George}}</ref>

Bassett joined [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in 1974 and was part of the Wimbledon team who, in the 1975 FA Cup, famously beat First Division [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] away in the 3rd round and then forced a draw in the 4th round at reigning League Champions [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], before losing narrowly 1–0 (the goal being a wide shot that deflected in off Bassett's knee) in the replay.

Bassett made a total of 141 appearances for Wimbledon whilst in the Southern League, 99 league and 42 cup: 53 appearances in 1974–75 scoring two goals, 43 in 1975–76 scoring two goals and 45 in 1976–77. In the Football League, Bassett made 39 appearances for Wimbledon: 35 league, one FA Cup and three League Cup, scoring once. Bassett also made 10 amateur international appearances whilst playing for Walton & Hersham.

Bassett retired from playing and became assistant manager soon after Wimbledon won election to the Football League in 1977 under the management of [[Allen Batsford]].

==Management career==

===Wimbledon===
Bassett was promoted to first team manager following the departure of Allen Batsford's successor, [[Dario Gradi]], to Crystal Palace in January 1981, when Wimbledon were ninth in the Fourth Division. Wimbledon's form improved substantially following Bassett's appointment, and a 4–1 home win over [[Rochdale A.F.C|Rochdale]] on 28 April 1981 (the penultimate game of the season) secured promotion to the Third Division.

Wimbledon initially struggled at the higher level during 1981–82, Bassett's first full season in charge, and they spent most of the season in a relegation battle. Despite winning four of their last five games of the season, they were still relegated back to the Fourth Division on goal difference, in 21st place.

An excellent campaign in [[1982–83 in English football|1982–83]] saw Bassett guide Wimbledon to promotion as the Fourth Division championship title winners with 98 points – the highest in any [[Football League]] division that year.

Although Wimbledon lost their first two games back in the Third Division, they crushed [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] (who had narrowly missed out on promotion to the Second Division the previous season) 6–0 at home in the third game of the league campaign, and by Christmas they were genuine promotion contenders. Promotion was sealed on the penultimate day of the season with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] beating [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] 3–1.

In June 1984, Bassett accepted an offer to become manager of Second Division club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], but changed his mind within 72 hours, refused to sign the contract at [[Selhurst Park]], and returned to Wimbledon, stating that "I gave it some serious thought, but in the end it just did not feel right. We have unfinished business, and I didn't really want to leave here."{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Wimbledon's life as a Second Division club began with a notable 2–2 home draw against promotion favourites [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on the opening day of the [[1984–85 in English football|1984–85 season]]. Wimbledon finally managed a secure 12th-place finish, in a season when they were never in any danger of being relegated or having any prospect of promotion.

The [[1985–86 in English football|1985–86]] season began well at [[Plough Lane (1912–98)|Plough Lane]], with a comfortable 3-0 home win over a financially troubled [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. By the end of October 1985, Wimbledon were third in the league and were contenders for a third promotion in four seasons – a feat previously achieved only by [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]]. On the final day of the season, a 1–1 draw at [[Bradford City]] saw Wimbledon seal the third and final promotion place to reach the First Division, only a mere nine years after joining the Football League.

In the [[1986–87 in English football|1986–87]] season, Wimbledon got off to a dream start in the First Division and a 1–0 win at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on 2 September 1986 put them top of the league.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wimbledon to the fore with Wise goal|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7YxUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-Y8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3506%2C853605|date=4 September 1986|access-date=7 January 2013|newspaper=New Straits Times}}</ref> They stayed top the following week,<ref name = "Soccer comes fourth in Wimbledon">{{cite news|title='And soccer only comes fourth in Wimbledon'|date=11 September 1986|access-date=16 December 2013|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9IxUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-Y8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4716%2C2410849|newspaper=New Straits Times}}</ref> until they were overtaken by [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] eleven days later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wimbledon crashes to earth in soccer|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sVkiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XqgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=868%2C2368350|date=15 September 1986|access-date=7 January 2013|newspaper=Montreal Gazette|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Wimbledon's form for the remainder of the autumn was less impressive, as they finished October in 14th place, but they steadily recovered as the season went on and achieved a highly impressive sixth place in the league with 66 points – ahead of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Bassett also guided his team to a shock 3–1 over eventual league champions [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[FA Cup]] fifth round,<ref>{{cite news|title=John Fashanu spearheads Wimbledon to Cup upset|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/472553361.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Feb+23%2C+1987&author=&pub=Toronto+Star&desc=John+Fashanu+spearheads+Wimbledon+to+Cup+upset&pqatl=google|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130216170624/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/472553361.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Feb+23,+1987&author=&pub=Toronto+Star&desc=John+Fashanu+spearheads+Wimbledon+to+Cup+upset&pqatl=google|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 February 2013|date=23 February 1987|access-date=7 January 2013|newspaper=Toronto Star}}</ref> though their hopes of cup glory were put on hold for a year when they lost 2–0 at home to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the quarter-final.<ref>{{cite news|title=FA Cup down to final four|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/472604391.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+16%2C+1987&author=AP&pub=Toronto+Star&desc=FA+Cup+down+to+final+four&pqatl=google|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130216162110/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/472604391.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+16,+1987&author=AP&pub=Toronto+Star&desc=FA+Cup+down+to+final+four&pqatl=google|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 February 2013|date=16 March 1987|access-date=7 January 2013|newspaper=Toronto Star|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

Whilst still hugely popular with both the club's fans and his own players, Bassett resigned from the club in June 1987, after chairman [[Sam Hammam]] attempted to insert a clause into Bassett's contract that would allow Hammam to veto Bassett's team selections.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Nick |title=One Season, Two Relegations: Dave Bassett's Nightmare 1987/88 Season |url=https://thesetpieces.com/latest-posts/one-season-two-relegations-dave-bassetts-nightmare-1987-88-season/ |website=The Set Pieces |date=15 May 2020 |publisher=The Set Pieces |access-date=23 May 2020}}</ref> Taking the vacant job at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], Bassett handed the reins at Wimbledon to [[Bobby Gould]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===Watford===
Bassett's reign as [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] manager was short-lived. The team had just finished ninth in the [[1986–87 in English football|1986–87]] season under the management of [[Graham Taylor]], who had left to take charge of relegated [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Before Bassett's arrival, Watford also sold [[John Barnes]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] but, instead of retaining the nucleus of the successful side of the mid-80s, he sold several other first-team regulars including [[Kevin Richardson (footballer)|Kevin Richardson]], [[David Bardsley]] and [[Lee Sinnott]]. Their replacements did not do as well, and when Watford started the [[1987–88 in English football|1987–88]] season in poor form, the blame was placed on Bassett who was sacked in January 1988<ref>{{cite news|title=Bassett leaves Watford after only eight months|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VTpAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UlkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4889%2C2066574|date=12 January 1988|access-date=16 January 2013|newspaper=The Herald|location=Glasgow}}</ref> with the club bottom of the First Division<ref>{{cite news|title=Sutton are in with the giants|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VTpAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UlkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1222%2C2052187|date=12 January 1988|access-date=16 January 2013|newspaper=The Herald|location=Glasgow}}</ref> and relegation to the Second Division looking inevitable.

===Sheffield United===
In 1987–88, Bassett became one of the few managers to have the dubious honour of being involved with two relegated clubs in the same season. On 21 January 1988, just days after leaving Watford, he took over at [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. Despite bringing in several new players, he was unable to prevent an already weak team from sliding into the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] after losing the double-legged play-off with [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] 2–1

However, with Bassett bringing his own backroom staff during the close season and more new players brought in, he took them back up at the first attempt in [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]]. A second successive promotion following in [[1989–90 in English football|1989–90]], and First Division football returned to [[Bramall Lane]] in the [[1990–91 in English football|1990–91]] season for the first time since [[1975–76 in English football|1975–76]]. An influential player in this team was striker [[Brian Deane]], who was capped three times by [[England national football team|England]].

Sheffield United failed to win any of their first 16 league games in 1990–91, breaking a [[Football League First Division|First Division]] record in the process,<ref>{{cite news|title=Sheffield must win to avoid record books|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ichUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=i5ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=4864%2C2365115|date=8 December 1990|access-date=16 January 2013|newspaper=New Straits Times|agency=Reuters}}</ref> and went into the new year at the bottom of the First Division. But a rousing resurgence in the second half of the season saw [[Sheffield United F.C.|the Blades]] climb up to a secure 13th place in the final table. They did even better in [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92]], finishing ninth in the First Division and securing a place in the new [[Premier League]].

Sheffield United's Premier League debut was reasonable. They finished 14th in the final table, reached the semi-finals of the [[FA Cup]], and condemned [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] to relegation by winning the penultimate game of the season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sad end for Clough as Forest go down|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=x85OAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xRMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4775%2C440724|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=2 May 1993|access-date=7 January 2013}}</ref> However, when Brian Deane was sold to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] during the 1993 close season, without him the Blades struggled more and got drawn into a relegation battle. It still looked like Sheffield United would stay up until Bassett's luck finally ran out on the last day of the [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94]] season. Needing a single point to guarantee that they would avoid relegation, they lost 3–2 at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], having led 2–1 with 5 minutes remaining, while [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]'s 3–2 win over [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] after being 2 goals down, when any result other than an Everton win would have seen Sheffield United stay up, condemned United to relegation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stein stuns Bassett|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-stein-stuns-bassett-1434396.html|work=The Independent|location=London|first=Geoff|last=Brown|date=8 May 1994|access-date=7 January 2013}}</ref> An eighth-place finish in the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95]] [[Football League First Division|Division One]] campaign was not enough for a play-off place, and Bassett resigned the following December with relegation looking more likely than promotion and protests against the board mounting.

===Crystal Palace===
Bassett took over at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in early February 1996,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bassett is new Palace boss|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mblOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Px8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2082%2C4359096|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=10 February 1996|access-date=16 January 2013|agency=Reuters}}</ref> taking charge of a club which was standing in 16th place in Division One and had lost most of its players the previous summer. Bassett set about rejuvenating the side, and a remarkable run of form meant that automatic promotion was still a possibility until the penultimate game of the season. In the end, they finished third in the table and reached the playoff final where they lost 2–1 in extra time to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].<ref name = "First Division play-off preview">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/3047855.stm|title=First Division play-off preview|work=BBC Sport|date=21 May 2003|access-date=16 January 2013}}</ref>

===Nottingham Forest===
In March 1997, Bassett left Crystal Palace to join Premier League strugglers [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Bassett quits Palace and joins Forest|agency=Reuters|work=The Nation|location=Bangkok|publisher=Nation Multimedia Group|date=1 March 1997|access-date=7 January 2013|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dKZNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=s0MDAAAAIBAJ&dq=bassett%20nottingham%20forest%20manager&pg=6362%2C145781}}</ref> as general manager and to assist England player, Forest's captain and caretaker manager Stuart Pearce. However Pearce was unable to prevent them from being relegated,<ref>{{cite web|title=Premiership 1996/97|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?tourn_id=117|publisher=Racing Post|work=Soccerbase|access-date=7 January 2013}}</ref> but they were promoted back to the Premier League at the first attempt under Bassett's charge after winning the [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]] Division One championship. 

However, Forest began their Premier League campaign without both [[Kevin Campbell (footballer)|Kevin Campbell]] and [[Pierre van Hooijdonk]], who had scored 53 goals between them during the promotion season. Campbell was sold to [[Trabzonspor]] against Bassett's wishes while he was on holiday, then van Hooijdonk went on strike and refused to return to the club.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/pierre-van-hooijdonk-nottingham-forest-5546085|work=Nottingham Post|title='Despicable' - Dave Bassett's story of broken promises and a bitter 20 year Nottingham Forest feud|date=20 June 2021|accessdate=26 September 2023}}</ref> Forest had a very poor start to the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99]] Premier League, and Bassett was sacked in January 1999, with "player power" cited as a reason.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bassett is eased out by player power; Van Hooijdonk saga was a major factor in sacking of Forest manager|work=The Herald|location=Glasgow|date=6 January 1999|access-date=16 January 2013|first=Ken|last=Gallacher|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/37850377.html?dids=37850377:37850377&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+06%2C+1999&author=Ken+Gallacher&pub=The+Herald&desc=Bassett+is+eased+out+by+player+power%3B+Van+Hooijdonk+saga+was+a+major+factor+in+sacking+of+Forest+manager&pqatl=google|archive-date=4 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104111311/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/37850377.html?dids=37850377:37850377&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+06,+1999&author=Ken+Gallacher&pub=The+Herald&desc=Bassett+is+eased+out+by+player+power%3B+Van+Hooijdonk+saga+was+a+major+factor+in+sacking+of+Forest+manager&pqatl=google|url-status=dead}}</ref> Forest were unable to avoid the drop under Bassett's successor [[Ron Atkinson]].

===Barnsley===
Bassett succeeded [[John Hendrie (Scottish footballer)|John Hendrie]] as [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] manager in May 1999. In his first season at the helm Barnsley reached the [[Football League First Division|Division One]] play-off final but missed out on promotion to the Premier League after losing to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].<ref name="First Division play-off preview"/> Bassett left in December 2000 after failing to mount another promotion challenge.<ref name = "Leaves Barnsley, linked with Wolves">{{cite news|title=Bassett in market as he leaves Barnsley|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/championship/2994985/Bassett-in-market-as-he-leaves-Barnsley.html|date=19 December 2000|access-date=16 January 2013|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|first=John|last=Ley}}</ref> He was linked with a move to succeed [[Colin Lee]] at fellow Division One club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]],<ref name="Leaves Barnsley, linked with Wolves"/> but when Lee's successor was announced in the new year it was [[Dave Jones (football manager)|Dave Jones]], formerly of [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], who took the role and not Bassett.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/1573145.stm|title=Who's next for the Foxes hot-seat?|date=1 October 2001|work=BBC Sport|first=Andrew|last=Warshaw}}</ref>

===Leicester City===
Bassett became [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] manager in October 2001. A four-month winless run from December condemned the team to relegation from the Premier League after a six-year tenancy. After a 1–0 defeat to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] which confirmed Leicester's relegation, Bassett became [[Director of Football|director of football]], handing over his managerial duties to assistant [[Micky Adams]]. He took over as manager again on 11 October 2004 after Adams' resignation, but left his director of football role after [[Craig Levein]] was appointed as Adams' replacement.

===Southampton===
Bassett was appointed as assistant manager to [[Harry Redknapp]] at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the summer of 2005, after the departure of [[Jim Smith (footballer, born 1940)|Jim Smith]].{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} When Redknapp left in December 2005, Bassett became the caretaker manager, a role he shared with [[Dennis Wise]].
