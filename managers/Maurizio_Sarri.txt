'''Maurizio Sarri''' ({{IPA|it|mauˈrittsjo ˈsarri}}; born 10 January 1959) is an Italian professional [[Association football|football]] manager who is currently manager of [[Serie A]] club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]].

Sarri did not play football professionally, taking part as an amateur [[centre back]] and coach while working as a banker. In 2005, he had his first [[Serie B]] job at [[Delfino Pescara 1936|Pescara]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/serie-b/pescara-sarri-nuovo-allenatore-10994|title=Pescara: Sarri nuovo allenatore|website=www.tuttomercatoweb.com}}</ref> In 2014, Sarri won promotion to [[Serie A]] with [[Empoli F.C.|Empoli]], and after preserving their place in the top flight he was hired by [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]]. He won several individual awards while managing the [[Naples]]-based club; after finishing as league runners-up in [[2017–18 Serie A|2017–18]], Sarri moved to English club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], where he won the [[UEFA Europa League]] in his only season with the club. He returned to Italy to coach [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] in 2019, with whom he went on to win the Serie A title in his [[2019–20 Juventus FC season|first]] season, becoming the oldest manager to win Serie A.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.football-italia.net/156372/sarri-be-oldest-scudetto-winner|title=Sarri to be oldest Scudetto winner|website=Football Italia|date=26 July 2020|access-date=26 July 2020}}</ref> After being sacked by Juventus, he was appointed manager of Lazio in 2021 before resigning in 2024. He returned as manager of Lazio in June 2025.

==Early life==
Son of a Tuscan worker (his father Amerigo, a former professional cyclist, worked as a crane operator at [[Ilva (company)|Italsider]] in [[Bagnoli]], a district of [[Naples]]),<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.napolitoday.it/sport/ssc-napoli/targa-strada-nascita-maurizio-sarri-bagnoli.html |title=Una targa nella strada dov'è nato Maurizio Sarri a Bagnoli |trans-title=A plaque in the street where Maurizio Sarri was born in Bagnoli |website=NapoliToday |publisher=Citynews |date=29 May 2019 |access-date=7 June 2019 |language=it}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Maurizio Sarri - Biografia|url=https://www.mauriziosarri.com/it/bio.html|access-date=2021-11-24|website=www.mauriziosarri.com}}</ref> Sarri was raised in [[Castro, Lombardy|Castro]] (province of Bergamo) and then in Faella (municipality of Castelfranco Piandiscò, in the [[province of Arezzo]]), where he divided his time as an amateur footballer and banker for [[Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena]] in Tuscany.

Sarri played only at an amateur level, in [[A.S.D.

Sarri used to work in the bank in the morning, and trained and played in games in the afternoon and evening. In 1990, aged 28, he transitioned into coaching, following the same schedule he adhered to for his entire work life. After gaining employment with minor side Tegoleto, he decided to quit his job to devote himself exclusively to his coaching career.<ref name=Gazzetta>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2005/novembre/17/mio_Pescara_nato_banca__ga_10_0511177207.shtml|title=Il mio Pescara nato in banca|trans-title=My Pescara was born in the bank|agency=[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]|author=Nicola Binda|page=18|language=it|date=17 November 2005|access-date=17 January 2016}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
===Early career===
Sarri's first club as manager was Stia, whom he started coaching in 1990 in [[Seconda Categoria]]. The following year, he was appointed manager of fellow league team Faellese, and took the club up to the [[Promozione]].<ref name="RNP">{{cite web|url=http://www.reggionelpallone.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1881%3Adalla-2a-categoria-alla-b-lincredibile-storia-di-maurizio-sarri&catid=24%3Aslide&Itemid=87/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722050953/http://www.reggionelpallone.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1881%3Adalla-2a-categoria-alla-b-lincredibile-storia-di-maurizio-sarri&catid=24%3Aslide&Itemid=87%2F|title=Dalla 2a Categoria alla B, l'incredibile storia di Maurizio Sarri|trans-title=From Seconda Categoria to B, the incredible story of Maurizio Sarri|work=Reggio Nel Palone|language=it|date=22 May 2010|access-date=23 July 2018|archive-date=22 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Sarri subsequently worked for Cavriglia and Antella, taking both sides to the [[Eccellenza]]. In 1998, he was named manager of fellow league team Valdema, but was fired the following January. He took over Tegoleto in the same division in September 1999.<ref name="RNP"/>

In 2000, Sarri signed for [[A.C. Sansovino|Sansovino]] in Eccellenza, and achieved promotion to [[Serie D]] with the side in his first season; he would remain for two further seasons in charge of the club, reaching the play-offs in his last season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amarantomagazine.it/arezzocalcio/files/Amaranto%20Magazine%20novembre%202006.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722023524/http://www.amarantomagazine.it/arezzocalcio/files/Amaranto%20Magazine%20novembre%202006.pdf|title=Patto per la Serie B|trans-title=Pact for Serie B|work=Amaranto Magazine|language=it |access-date=7 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 July 2011}}</ref> His successes with Sansovino caused [[Serie C2]] side [[A.C.

On 18 June 2005, Sarri resigned from Sangiovannese,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sport.repubblica.it/news/sport/calcio-c1-sarri-lascia-la-sangiovannese/993284|title=Calcio, C1/A: Sarri lascia la Sangiovannese|trans-title=Football, C1 / A: Sarri leaves Sangiovannese|work=la Repubblica|language=it|date=18 June 2005|access-date=23 July 2018}}</ref> and was appointed manager of [[Serie B]] side [[Delfino Pescara 1936|Pescara]] on 9 July.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/serie-b/pescara-sarri-nuovo-allenatore-10994|title=Pescara: Sarri nuovo allenatore|trans-title=Pescara: Sarri new manager|work=Tutto Mercato Web|language=it|date=9 July 2005|access-date=23 July 2018}}</ref> After avoiding relegation, he left the club on 30 June 2006 and was appointed at the helm of fellow second division side [[A.C.

Sacked on 15 February of the following year, he was replaced by the outspoken manager Robert Cerullo, CPA, MBA and he only returned to coaching duties on 24 March 2010 with [[U.S. Grosseto F.C.|Grosseto]]. On 6 July of that year, Sarri was appointed manager of [[U.S. Alessandria Calcio 1912|Alessandria]] in [[Lega Pro Prima Divisione]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tuononews.it/tuononews.nsf/AG02?OpenAgent&Page=7DA0707D8D9&Ref=EL |title=TuonoNews.it - Quotidiano online di informazione e cultura di Alessandria |access-date=7 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722055731/http://www.tuononews.it/tuononews.nsf/AG02?OpenAgent&Page=7DA0707D8D9&Ref=EL |archive-date=22 July 2011  }}</ref> and reached the promotion play-offs, being knocked out in the semifinals by [[U.S. Salernitana 1919|Salernitana]].

===Napoli===
[[File:Sarri 2016.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sarri during his spell in charge of [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in 2016]]
On 11 June 2015, Sarri left Empoli and signed for the club of his city of birth, [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], replacing [[Rafael Benítez]], who left after missing out on a [[UEFA Champions League]] place.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |title=Napoli appoint Maurizio Sarri as new head coach |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/12/napoli-appoint-maurizio-sarri-head-coach |access-date=19 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |agency=Associated Press |date=12 June 2015}}</ref>

In his [[2015–16 Serie A|first season]], Sarri brought in [[Elseid Hysaj]], [[Pepe Reina]] and [[Allan (footballer, born 1991)|Allan]]. The trio would go on to be first-team stalwarts for the following campaign, as Napoli finished runners-up to [[Juventus FC|Juventus]]. Sarri extended his stay at the club until 2020 on 27 May 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportal.it/calciomercato/sarri-rinnova-uno-di-famiglia-_10748.html|title=Sarri rinnova: "A Napoli mi sento uno di famiglia"|trans-title=Sarri renews: "At Napoli I feel like one of the family"|work=Sportal.it|language=it|date=27 May 2016|access-date=23 July 2018}}</ref> Two months later, Juventus would manage to sign [[Gonzalo Higuaín]] from Napoli for [[Euro|€]]90 million in the summer, who had managed to equal the record for most goals scored in a singular [[Serie A]] season, with 36.

[[File:Maurizio Sarri at Baku before 2019 UEFA Europe League Final.jpg|thumb|right|Sarri with Chelsea in 2019]]
From a tactical standpoint, Sarri is known for his intelligence, attention to detail and his meticulous approach in preparing for matches during weekly training sessions.

His teams usually play a high defensive line and adopt the [[offside trap]] and a [[zonal marking]] system. He requires his defensive players to be synchronised in their movements, anticipate plays, and look at the ball as a point of reference, not their opponents. Other key elements of Sarri's line-up are the presence of a [[Midfielder#Deep-lying playmaker (Strolling 10)|deep-lying]] [[playmaker]] who dictates play in front of the back-line, such as [[Jorginho (footballer, born December 1991)|Jorginho]], and overlapping attacking [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full backs]], to provide width to his team, as his players often attack from the flank, looking to play quick exchanges and make runs in behind into the box rather than deliver crosses into the area, however. As such, he favours dynamic wingers in his team, as well as defenders and goalkeepers who are comfortable on the ball, to help his team retain possession, and hard-working players who can implement his high pressing game.<ref name="filosofia">{{cite web |url=https://sport.leggo.it/calcio/sarri_difesa_napoli-1183567.html |title=Napoli e difesa, la nuova filosofia di Sarri: "Dovete guardare la palla, non l'avversario" |trans-title=Napoli and defence, Sarri's new philosophy: "You need to watch the ball, not your opponent" |publisher=sport.leggo.it |language=it |author1=Roberto Ventre |date=7 August 2015 |access-date=20 October 2018 }}</ref><ref name="style"/><ref name="Lavagna tattica">{{cite web |url=https://www.juventus.com/it/news/news/2016/lavagna-tattica--il-napoli.php |title=Lavagna tattica: il Napoli |publisher=www.juventus.com |language=it |date=12 February 2016 |access-date=20 October 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11377449/how-will-napolis-jorginho-fit-man-city-and-what-are-his-qualities |title=Jorginho: The Andrea Pirlo-style midfielder set for Manchester City |publisher=Sky Sports |author1=James Walker-Roberts |date=31 May 2018 |access-date=7 September 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.areanapoli.it/varie/curiosita----cosi-sarri-insegna-la-linea-del-fuorigioco-ai-difensori-dice-di_186854.html |title=CURIOSITA' - Così Sarri insegna la linea del fuorigioco: ai difensori dice di... |publisher=www.areanapoli.it |language=it |date=10 July 2016 |access-date=20 October 2018 }}</ref>

On the ball, Sarri's teams are known for playing an attractive, exciting, and attacking-minded brand of football, based on retaining possession, movement off the ball, and many quick, short passes on the ground;<ref name="style"/><ref name="Lavagna tattica"/><ref name="innovator"/><ref name="glossary"/> this style has come to be known as "Sarri-ball" or "liquid football" in the media, while ''[[L'Équipe]]'' has described it as "vertical [[tiki-taka]]".<ref name="glossary"/> The Italian encyclopaedia [[Treccani]] instead coined the term "Sarrismo" to describe the offensive and spectacular style of football that Sarri's teams play.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Premier-League/13-09-2018/sarrismo-neologismo-treccani-maurizio-sarri-chelsea-napoli-290968395790.shtml |title=Il "Sarrismo" ora è realtà: anche per la Treccani... |publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=it |date=13 September 2018 |access-date=20 October 2018 }}</ref>

Sarri's teams' modern, innovative and creative playing style, as well as their mentality, ability to move up the pitch quickly on counter-attacks and score many goals, has won praise from several pundits, players and managers, including [[Pep Guardiola]] and [[Cesc Fàbregas]];<ref name="Lavagna tattica"/><ref name="innovator">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/next-chelsea-manager-maurizio-sarri-announced-confirmed-antonio-conte-sacked-a8444646.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220512/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/next-chelsea-manager-maurizio-sarri-announced-confirmed-antonio-conte-sacked-a8444646.html |archive-date=12 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Meet Maurizio Sarri, the chain-smoking innovator who Chelsea hope can coach them into a new dimension |work=The Independent |author1=James Horncastle |date=13 July 2018 |access-date=20 October 2018 }}</ref><ref name="glossary">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/10/17/napoli-bring-sarri-ball-man-city-glossary-footballs-tactical/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/10/17/napoli-bring-sarri-ball-man-city-glossary-footballs-tactical/ |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=As Napoli bring 'Sarri-ball' to Man City, a glossary of football's tactical systems |newspaper=The Telegraph |author1=Charlie Eccleshare |date=17 October 2017 |access-date=20 October 2018 }}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name="Fabregas">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/chelsea-fc-latest-news-cesc-fabregas-maurizio-sarri-premier-league-epl-a8571636.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220512/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/chelsea-fc-latest-news-cesc-fabregas-maurizio-sarri-premier-league-epl-a8571636.html |archive-date=12 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Cesc Fabregas wishes Maurizio Sarri had coached him earlier as he reveals he wants Chelsea stay |work=The Independent |author1=Matt McGeehan |date=6 October 2018 |access-date=20 October 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eurosport.com/football/premier-league/2018-2019/maurizio-sarri-says-europe-s-best-eden-hazard-can-score-40-goals-but-is-it-realistic_sto6934538/story.shtml |title=Maurizio Sarri says 'Europe's best' Eden Hazard can score 40 goals - but is it realistic? |publisher=www.eurosport.com |date=16 September 2018 |access-date=20 October 2018 }}</ref> in 2018, former manager [[Arrigo Sacchi]] praised the style employed by Sarri's Napoli side as "the most important thing seen in Italy in the last 20 years".<ref name="Sarri’s Napoli the best">{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/122791/%E2%80%A8sacchi-%E2%80%98sarri%E2%80%99s-napoli-best%E2%80%99 |title=Sacchi: 'Sarri's Napoli the best' |publisher=Football Italia |date=11 June 2018 |access-date=20 October 2018 }}</ref> However, despite receiving plaudits for his tactical approach to the game, he also initially came under criticism from some in the sport for his failure to win a title as a manager, until leading Chelsea to victory in the Europa League in 2019;<ref name="anti-Conte"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-manager-maurizio-sarri-must-win-trophies-not-just-entertain-to-be-a-great-coach-says-napoli-a3899691.html |title=Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri must win trophies - not just entertain - to be a great coach, says Napoli president |publisher=www.standard.co.uk |author1=Alex Young |date=31 July 2018 |access-date=20 October 2018 }}</ref> he has also been accused in the media of being stubborn and tactically inflexible at times.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/stubborn-maurizio-sarri-must-at-least-show-he-still-believes-in-his-work-at-chelsea-w3lhfd0fs |title=Stubborn Maurizio Sarri must at least show he still believes in his work at Chelsea |work=[[The Times]] |last1=Marcotti |first1=Gabriele |date=19 February 2019 |access-date=19 February 2019 }}</ref>

==Controversy==
{{Criticism section|date=July 2025}}
During the 2015–16 season, Sarri found himself embroiled in a heated exchange with [[Roberto Mancini]], then head coach of [[Inter Milan]], in the final minutes of a [[Coppa Italia]] match on 20 January 2016, where Mancini accused Sarri of directing a [[Homophobe|homophobic]] slur at him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/19/internazionale-napoli-roberto-mancini-maurizio-sarri|title=Inter's Roberto Mancini: Napoli manager Maurizio Sarri called me a faggot|website=the Guardian|first=Marcus|last=Christenson|date=19 January 2016}}</ref> Sarri responded to the accusations by saying that he was not a homophobe, stating "what happens on the field, stays on the field".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Serie-A/Napoli/19-01-2016/napoli-sarri-ero-nervoso-ma-ho-chiesto-scusa-sono-cose-che-succedono-campo-140328584198.shtml|title=Napoli, Sarri: "Sono cose che succedono in campo"|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=it|date=19 January 2016}}</ref> Sarri was consequently fined €20,000 and banned for two Coppa Italia matches by [[Lega Serie A]] for "directing extremely insulting epithets at the coach of the opposing team".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/78710/two-game-ban-sarri|title=Two-game ban for Sarri - Football Italia|website=www.football-italia.net|date=21 January 2016}}</ref>

In March 2018, Sarri came under further criticism in the media when he was accused of making sexist comments when responding to female reporter Titti Improta of Canale 21, who had asked him in a post-match interview if he thought that Napoli's title challenge had been compromised; he subsequently apologised,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.it/2018/03/12/la-risposta-sessista-di-maurizio-sarri-alla-giornalista-sei-donna-e-sei-carina-e-non-ti-mando-a-fare-in-culo-per-questo_a_23383100/ |title=La risposta sessista di Maurizio Sarri alla giornalista: "Sei donna e sei carina e non ti mando a fare in culo per questo" |publisher=www.huffingtonpost.it |language=it |date=12 March 2018 |access-date=20 October 2018 }}</ref> later also adding that he had been joking.<ref name="divertirmi"/>

When asked about these two incidents in his first press conference with Chelsea in 2018, Sarri expressed regret regarding his behaviour, commenting: "These were mistakes, that is for sure. I think that those who know me very well cannot define me in this way – not homophobic or sexist or racist, absolutely not. I am an extremely open person, and I do not have these kinds of problems, and I hope to show this when I work here and live here."<ref name="anti-Conte"/>
