'''Brendan Rodgers''' (born 26 January 1973) is a Northern Irish professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Association football|player]].

Rodgers began his career as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] at [[Ballymena United F.C.|Ballymena United]], where he stayed until he was signed by [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] at the age of 18, although a genetic knee condition forced him to retire at age 20. He remained at Reading as a coach and then academy director, and continued to play non-league football at [[Newport (IOW) F.C.|Newport IOW]], [[Witney Town F.C.|Witney Town]] and [[Newbury Town F.C.|Newbury Town]] for several years. After a period travelling around Spain to study coaching methods, he was invited by [[José Mourinho]] to join [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] as [[Chelsea F.C. Reserves and Academy|youth manager]] in 2004, later being promoted to [[Chelsea F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserve manager]] in 2006.

In 2008, he was appointed manager of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], where he remained until he accepted an offer to become manager of his former club Reading in 2009. He left the club by mutual consent after some disappointing results six months later. He returned to management with [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in 2010, leading the club to promotion to the [[Premier League]], the first Welsh team to do so, before guiding them to finish 11th the following season. On 1 June 2012, Rodgers became the new manager of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], whom he led to runners-up position in the league in the [[2013–14 Premier League|2013–14 season]] before his dismissal in October 2015.

Rodgers became manager of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in May 2016 and led them to an undefeated domestic season in his first year, and [[Treble (association football)|trebles]] in both of his first two seasons. He left Celtic for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in February 2019, winning the [[2021 FA Cup Final|2021 FA Cup]] in his second full season, before he left by mutual consent in April 2023. He returned to Celtic in June 2023 and won two further Scottish league titles in his first two seasons back at the club, before resigning in October 2025.
