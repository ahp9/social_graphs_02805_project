'''Frank Charles Barlow''' (born 15 October 1946) is an English former [[association football|footballer]] who moved into coaching and [[Manager (association football)|club management]] since retiring from playing. Born in [[Mexborough]], England, he spent the bulk of his playing career at [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] before moving to [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] for a spell.

After retiring from playing he moved into management and coaching, managing [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] and [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] before having spells as caretaker manager with both [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. He is without a club after leaving his post of assistant manager at Sheffield United in April 2013.

==Playing career==

===Sheffield United===
Barlow was a defensive [[midfielder]] who started his football career with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] after being spotted playing for Don and Dearne Schoolboys during which time he had captained the England Schoolboys team.<ref name="blades whos who">{{cite book |author=Denis Clarebrough & Andrew Kirkham |title=Sheffield United Who's Who |publisher=Hallamshire Press |year=2008|pages=41 |isbn=978-1-874718-69-7}}</ref> After signing professional terms in 1965 at the age of 19 he was to remain at [[Bramall Lane]] for seven years but never cemented his place in the first team during his tenure. Seen more as a squad player available to fill in when other teammates were unavailable it was only during the 1969–70 season that he played regularly in [[the Football League]]. Despite this he went on to make over 120 appearances for the Blades during his seven-year stay.<ref name="blades whos who" />

===Chesterfield===
Barlow was bought by [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in 1972 for a then club record fee of £15,000, where he was to remain for the remainder of his playing career. Spending four years on Chesterfield's books he made 140+ appearances, scoring three times, before a series of knee injuries forced him to retire following which he became first team coach at the age of 31.

==Management and coaching==

===Chesterfield===
Installed as first team coach after he retired from playing, Barlow briefly became the [[caretaker manager]] of [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] following the sacking of [[Joe Shaw (footballer, born 1928)|Joe Shaw]] in 1976 before being made the full-time manager in 1980 after the departure of [[Arthur Cox (footballer)|Arthur Cox]], although he protested several times throughout his reign that he didn't want the job. He said he was always more comfortable as a coach than as a boss.

Despite this, he brought success to the club in his first season as manager, winning the [[Anglo-Scottish Cup]] (after beating [[Notts County]] 2–1) and the divisional manager of the month award for March 1981. His refreshing honesty was heavily appreciated by the supporters and he managed to keep the club in touch with promotion, despite a worsening financial situation, which ultimately led to the club being relegated in his second season with Chesterfield. When a new board of directors came in, the whole coaching team was sacked, but Barlow was offered a place among the new setup. He declined out of loyalty to his coaching staff and thus left with his dignity and self-respect intact, without carrying much of the blame for Chesterfield's dire relegation season.

===Scunthorpe United===
Barlow almost immediately returned to football, becoming the assistant manager at [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] under [[Allan Clarke (footballer)|Allan Clarke]], being promoted to manager a year later when Clarke resigned. Again he said he didn't want the job, but nevertheless he had a fair amount of success, keeping them clear of relegation in 1984 and then maintaining a respectable league position the following season.

He left Scunthorpe in 1987 and did not return to management for almost 20 years, concentrating mostly on coaching and various other back-room posts.

===19 years in the shadows===
Barlow made an immediate return to football, this time a youth and reserve team coach for [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. A year later he joined [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] as a coach, where he remained for 7 years until 1996. Barlow then moved to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] with [[Trevor Francis]] for 2 years before returning to Sheffield Wednesday as assistant manager and then onto [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]]. He left in 2004, joining [[Paul Merson]] as assistant manager at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] but resigned in January 2005 after a 5–0 defeat at the hands of [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] almost cost Merson his job.

===Back in the spotlight with Nottingham Forest===
In January 2005, [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]'s new manager [[Gary Megson]] brought Barlow to the club as assistant manager. When Megson was unable to avoid relegation into [[EFL League One|League One]] of [[the Football League]], and then struggled to maintain a promotion push, he left the club 'by mutual consent' and Barlow was made co-caretaker manager along with Forest's reserve team coach [[Ian McParland]]. It was a position Barlow hoped he would never be in again after leaving Scunthorpe almost 20 years before.

Barlow sparked a remarkable turn around on Trentside, and led Forest to an unbeaten run of 10 games, with 6 straight wins just missing out on equalling a club record of 7 straight wins when they fell to a 3–2 defeat at the hands of [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]]. Frank Barlow was named joint Manager of the Month with McParland for March 2006.

When [[Colin Calderwood]] was appointed as the new boss, Barlow and McParland reverted to coaching roles with Forest.

===Hull City===
[[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] appointed Frank Barlow as caretaker manager on 28 June 2006 due to protracted negotiations in securing the release of their managerial target, [[Phil Parkinson]], from his contract with [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester]]. This appointment was only to last two days as Parkinson was appointed manager on 30 June 2006, with Barlow reverting to the role of his assistant.

Barlow's role was to be short lived however, a coaching staff re-shuffle following the Tigers' disappointing start to the season saw Barlow leave the club in October 2006.<ref name="leave tigers">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/6078514.stm|title=Barlow leaves in Hull reshuffle|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=27 April 2012|date=23 October 2006}}</ref>

===Bradford City===
Following his departure from The [[KC Stadium]] Barlow moved to [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] as assistant to caretaker manager [[David Wetherall]].<ref name="joins bradfod">{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/search/display.var.1190217.0.barlow_hopes_to_repeat_forest_mission.php|title=Barlow Hopes to Repeat Forest Mission|work=Telegraph & Argus|access-date=27 April 2012|date=13 February 2007}}</ref>

===Wigan Athletic===
In June 2007 [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] appointed Barlow as the assistant manager to [[Chris Hutchings]]. Barlow, now 60, was taken on for his vast experience in the game, as Hutchings enthused "I need someone I can trust implicitly when it comes to football knowledge, you can't get more experience than he's got, he knows players inside-out." After Hutchings was sacked in November 2007, Barlow was named as Wigan's caretaker manager. When Steve Bruce was appointed the club's new manager and with Eric Black brought across from [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] assuming the role of assistant manager, Barlow was appointed to the position of first-team coach.

===Sheffield United===
In June 2011, Barlow returned to his first club [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] to become assistant manager, working under [[Danny Wilson (footballer, born 1960)|Danny Wilson]].<ref name="back to blades">{{cite news|title=Sheffield United name Frank Barlow as assistant manager|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/13725957|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 June 2011|access-date=27 April 2012}}</ref> The pair guided the Blades to the [[2012 Football League One play-off final|League One play-off final]] in their first season in charge, only to see their side beaten by [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] on penalties.<ref name="play off">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18127853|title=Huddersfield promoted after epic shoot-out win over Sheffield United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 May 2012|access-date=14 April 2013}}</ref> United again challenged for promotion the following season, but a poor run of results after Christmas saw Barlow and Wilson sacked in April 2013.<ref name="blades sack">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22101757|title=Danny Wilson leaves post as Sheffield United manager|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 April 2013|access-date=14 April 2013}}</ref>
