Perryman was born in [[Ealing]], [[Middlesex]]. A [[midfielder]] and later [[defender (association football)|defender]], he played in a club record 866 first team appearances in all competitions for Tottenham Hotspur between 1969 and 1986 and was their longest serving player. During his seventeen-year career with the north London club, Perryman collected many medals, winning the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in 1972 and 1984 (playing in both legs of the [[1972 UEFA Cup final|1972 final]] and just the first leg of the [[1984 UEFA Cup final|1984 final]] as he was suspended for the second),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2019/may/31/tottenham-won-european-trophy-35-years-ago-anderlecht|title=When Tottenham won their last European trophy – 35 years ago |publisher=Guardian |date=31 May 2019 |access-date=4 June 2019}}</ref> and the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] in 1971 and 1973. He followed in the footsteps of [[Joe Harvey (footballer)|Joe Harvey]] and [[Danny Blanchflower]] and skippered Tottenham to successive [[FA Cup]] wins in 1981 and 1982. Perryman was also voted the [[Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]] in 1982.

Perryman did not score often even by the standards of contemporary midfielders, however he scored both goals in a 2–1 home win over [[AC Milan]] in the 1972 UEFA Cup semi-final first leg. Spurs went on to win the round 3–2 on aggregate, and then won the title, defeating [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the final.

After leaving [[White Hart Lane]] Perryman moved to [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in March 1986, but was cup-tied for their victory in the [[1986 Football League Cup final]].<ref>{{cite news

As a coach, he has won the [[J.League]] stage championship (1999 2nd Stage) and the [[Asian Cup Winners Cup]] (2000), both with Shimizu S-Pulse. He then worked at [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] with no official title to help them stay in the then football Division 3.
