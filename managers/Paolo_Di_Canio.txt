'''Paolo Di Canio''' (born 9 July 1968) is an Italian former professional [[footballer]] and manager. During his playing career he made over 500 league appearances and scored over one hundred goals as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]]. He primarily played as a [[deep-lying forward]], but he could also play as an [[attacking midfielder]], or as a [[Winger (association football)|winger]]. Di Canio was regarded as a technically skilled but temperamental player.<ref name="Di Canio, Paolo">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttocalciatori.net/Di_Canio_Paolo|title=Di Canio, Paolo|website=tuttocalciatori.net|language=it|access-date=16 April 2015}}</ref><ref name="Il Pallone Racconta: Paolo Di Canio">{{cite web|url=http://ilpalloneracconta.blogspot.ca/2007/07/paolo-di-canio.html|title=Paolo Di Canio|publisher=Il Pallone Racconta|language=it|date=10 July 2014|access-date=16 April 2015}}</ref><ref name="Paolo di Canio">{{cite web|url=http://www.magliarossonera.it/protagonisti/Gioc-Dicanio.html|title=Paolo di Canio|website=magliarossonera.it|language=it|access-date=16 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=tuttojuve.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttojuve.com/gli-eroi-bianconeri/gli-eroi-in-bianconero-paolo-di-canio-196426|title=Gli eroi in bianconero: Paolo DI CANIO|publisher=Tutto Juve|language=it|author1=Stefano Bedeschi|date=10 July 2014|access-date=1 February 2016}}</ref><ref name="Best Overseas Players in EPL">{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/731574-epl-ranking-60-of-the-best-overseas-players-in-english-premier-league-history#slide15 |title=English Premier League: Ranking 60 of the Best Overseas Players in EPL History |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=Thorpe |first1=Lee |date=14 June 2011 |access-date=26 October 2019 }}</ref><ref name="Maverick worth the risk">{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/maverick-worth-the-risk-1.1045576 |title=Maverick worth the risk |newspaper=The Irish Times |last1=Taylor |first1=Daniel |date=4 January 2002 |access-date=25 April 2020 }}</ref>

Di Canio began his career in the Italian [[Serie A]], playing for [[SS Lazio|Lazio]], [[Juventus FC|Juventus]], [[SSC Napoli|Napoli]] and [[AC Milan|Milan]], before a brief spell with the Scottish club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. He subsequently spent seven years in the English [[Premier League]] with [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. He returned to Italy in 2004, playing for Lazio and [[Atletico Roma FC|Cisco Roma]] before retiring in 2008. He played for the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italian under-21s]], making nine appearances and scoring twice, and was a member of the squad that finished in third place at the [[1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] under manager [[Cesare Maldini]], but was never capped for the [[Italy national football team|senior team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=401&squadra=1|title=Nazionale in Cifre: Convocazioni e presenze in campo – Di Canio, Paolo|website=figc.it|publisher=FIGC|language=it|access-date=16 April 2015|archive-date=16 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416221139/http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=401&squadra=1|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Among the individual awards he received as a player, Di Canio was named [[SPFA Players' Player of the Year]] in 1997 and West Ham's [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|player of the season]] in 2000. However, his career was at times characterised by controversy: he received an eleven-match ban in 1998 for pushing a referee and attracted negative publicity over his allegiance to [[Italian Fascism|fascism]].

In 2011, Di Canio entered football management in England with [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], guiding them in his first full season as manager to promotion to [[Football League One|League One]]. He was appointed as the [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]] manager at the end of March 2013 but was sacked on 22 September after Sunderland had won only three of thirteen games under his managership.

==Early life==
Di Canio was born in Rome, in the district of Quarticciolo, a working-class area populated mainly by [[AS Roma|Roma]] fans. However, Di Canio was drawn to their local rivals [[SS Lazio|Lazio]]. As a young boy, he was addicted to cola and similar drinks and called ''Pallocca'', a slang term meaning ''lard-ball''. He was fat and knock-kneed, and needed to wear orthopedic shoes – "But I never hid. My response was to exercise; to try to become the kind of person I am."<ref name="independent1">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/paolo-di-canio-my-life-speaks-for-me-6273526.html |title=Paolo Di Canio: 'My life speaks for me' – Profiles – People |work=The Independent |date=11 December 2011 |access-date=2013-04-03 |location=London}}</ref>

==Club career==
===Italy===
He signed for [[SS Lazio|Lazio]] in 1985 and remained there until 1990. Lazio won promotion to Serie A in 1988, having narrowly escaped relegation to [[Serie C1]] the year before. He finally made his first-team debut in October 1988 and went on to play 30 games during the [[1988–89 Serie A|1988–89 season]].<ref name="ffile">{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12028/8936979/paolo-di-canio-factfile|title=Paolo Di Canio factfile|publisher=Sky Sports|date=23 September 2013|access-date=29 January 2014}}</ref> Di Canio scored the winner in the first [[Derby della Capitale|Rome derby]] of the season, a goal which contributed to Lazio's survival in Serie A that season and earning him hero status. In 1990, he was sold to another of Italy's biggest clubs, [[Juventus FC|Juventus]];<ref name="ffile" /> although he won the [[1992–93 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] with the Turin side in 1993, he struggled to gain playing time during his tenure with the club, because of the presence of other forwards and creative midfielders in the team, such as [[Roberto Baggio]], [[Salvatore Schillaci]], [[Pierluigi Casiraghi]], [[Fabrizio Ravanelli]], [[Gianluca Vialli]] and [[Andreas Möller]].<ref name=tuttojuve.com/> He left Juventus after an "animated exchange" with then manager [[Giovanni Trapattoni]]<ref name="independent1" /><ref name="agr">{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Stewart|title=Is Di Canio a martyr or does he have a hidden agenda?|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/is-di-canio-a-martyr-or-does-he-have-a-hidden-agenda.20274802|publisher=Herald Scotland|access-date=29 January 2014|date=20 February 2013}}</ref> and spent the [[1993–94 Serie A|1993–94]] season with [[SSC Napoli|Napoli]].<ref name="independent1" /> Two seasons followed at [[AC Milan]], where, despite winning the [[1995–96 Serie A|Serie A title in 1996]], he once again struggled to gain playing time because of heavy competition from his teammates, culminating in another row, this time with [[Fabio Capello]].<ref name="independent1" /><ref name="agr" /><ref name=tuttojuve.com/><ref name="Paolo di Canio"/>

===Celtic===
In July 1996 he joined [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in Scotland. In his first season at the club, he scored 15 goals in 37 appearances<ref>{{cite web|last=Haggerty|first=Anthony|title=Subbuteo team was reason I joined Celtic, admits Paolo Di Canio|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/subbuteo-team-was-reason-i-joined-celtic-1002987|publisher=Daily Record|access-date=29 January 2014|date=24 December 2008}}</ref> and won the [[PFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year|SPFA Player of the Year]] award.<ref name="celt1">{{cite web|title=Di Canio's Celtic years: good, bad and ugly|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/spfl/di-canio-s-celtic-years-good-bad-and-ugly-1-3106641|publisher=The Scotsman|access-date=29 January 2014|date=23 September 2013}}</ref> However, his time in Glasgow was dogged by controversy; he was sent off during a 2–2 draw against [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] in November 1996<ref>{{cite news|title=Paolo's Italian for loco|url=http://www.thecelticwiki.com/page/1996-11-30%3A+Celtic+2-2+Hearts,+Premier+Division|access-date=30 January 2014|newspaper=Scotland on Sunday|date=1 December 1996}}</ref> and was heavily involved in an acrimonious league match against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in March 1997 where he behaved aggressively towards [[Ian Ferguson (footballer born 1967)|Ian Ferguson]] and gestured in the direction of Rangers' bench as he was led from the field by teammates.<ref name="celt1" /> He was called to the referee's room after the teams had returned to the dressing room and was shown another yellow card in addition to the one he had received earlier in the game.<ref name="celt1" /> He demanded a large wage rise at the end of the season, but this was rejected by Celtic.<ref name="celt1" /> He then refused to join the squad in the Netherlands for their pre-season training during July 1997.<ref name="ffile" />

===Sheffield Wednesday===
On 6 August 1997, Di Canio moved to the English [[Premier League|Premiership]] as he joined [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in a transfer deal valued at around £4.2 million.<ref name="celt1" /> Whilst in Sheffield, Di Canio was the club's leading goal scorer for the [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]] season with 14 goals and he became a favourite of the fans.

In September 1998, Di Canio pushed referee [[Paul Alcock]] to the ground after being sent off while playing for Sheffield Wednesday against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at Hillsborough, which resulted in an extended ban of eleven matches.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/199792.stm|title=Di Canio gets 11-match ban for push on ref |date=23 October 1998|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> and him being fined £10,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/199527.stm|title=Di Canio ban too short, say referees |date=24 October 1998|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

===West Ham United===
[[File:Paolo Di Canio playing at Tony Carr's testimonial, May 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|Di Canio playing in [[Tony Carr]]'s testimonial match in 2010]]

In January 1999, Di Canio signed for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] for £1.5 million. He had not played football since his ban following his push on Paul Alcock. West Ham manager [[Harry Redknapp]], on signing Di Canio, admitted he was taking a chance but said of the player "He can do things with the ball that people can only dream of". Di Canio said of his ban, "I made a mistake and I'm sorry. West Ham have given me a big chance and I'm very happy."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jan/28/newsstory.sport | title=West Ham sign £1.5m Di Canio | work=The Guardian | date=28 January 1999 | access-date=30 January 2014 | author=Brodkin, Jon}}</ref> He scored his first goal for West Ham on 27 February 1999 in his fourth game.

In December 2000, late in a game against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and with both sides vying for the winning goal, Di Canio shunned a goal-scoring opportunity and stopped play, grabbing the ball from a cross inside the [[penalty area|box]], as the Everton goalkeeper [[Paul Gerrard]] was lying injured on the ground after he twisted his knee attempting a clearance on the edge of the box. The [[Goodison Park]] crowd reacted with a standing ovation. FIFA officially lauded Di Canio's gesture, describing it as "a special act of good sportsmanship,"<ref name="Fair Play award">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1682501.stm |title=Di Canio wins Fair Play award |work=BBC News |date=17 December 2001 |access-date=1 May 2010}}</ref> and awarded him next year the [[FIFA Fair Play Award]].

[[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] tried to sign him for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] halfway through the [[2001–02 in English football|2001–02 season]], but his attempts were unsuccessful and Di Canio remained in [[East End of London|East London]] for another season and a half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_united/s/1023534_ferguson_21_that_got_away |title=Ferguson: 21 that got away – Manchester Evening News |publisher=Menmedia.co.uk |date=8 November 2007 |access-date=2013-04-03 |archive-date=19 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219125700/http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_united/s/1023534_ferguson_21_that_got_away |url-status=dead }}</ref> Di Canio insisted that he would not have been able to leave West Ham, who had handed him a "lifeline" in the "worst moment" in his life.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.football365.com/news/paolo-di-canio-alex-ferguson-reaction-rejected-man-utd |title=Di Canio reveals Ferguson reaction after he rejected Man Utd |date=8 April 2020 |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>

In 2003, with the Hammers struggling at the bottom of the league, Di Canio had a very public row with manager [[Glenn Roeder]] and was dropped from the first team. However, he returned at the end of the season (after Roeder, stricken by a brain tumour, was replaced by [[Trevor Brooking]]) and scored a winner against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the penultimate game of the season, a game that boosted West Ham's chances of staying in the Premiership.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2968013.stm |title=Di Canio grabs West Ham lifeline |work=BBC News |date=3 May 2003 |access-date=1 May 2010}}</ref> However, they were relegated on the final day of the season after a 2–2 draw away to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], where Di Canio scored an 89th-minute equaliser.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/cc_championship/westham/reports/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/03/05/11/SOCCER_Birmingham.html&TEAMHD=westham&DIV=nat1&TEAM=WEST--HAM&RH=West--Ham&PREV_SEASON=2001 |title=Birmingham 2 West Ham 2 |work=Sporting Life|location=UK |access-date=1 May 2010}}</ref> He was released on a free transfer and signed with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] for the start of the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04 season]].<ref name="ch1">{{cite news|title=Di Canio joins Charlton|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/3142339.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=30 January 2014|date=11 August 2003}}</ref>

===Charlton Athletic===
In his one season at [[The Valley (London)|The Valley]], Di Canio helped Charlton finish the season in seventh place, the club's highest league finish since 1953. However, he only scored four league goals for the Addicks, all of which came from the penalty spot (one from a rebound). One of the penalty kicks was an audacious "[[Antonín Panenka#Panenka penalty|Panenka]]"-style penalty kick against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Arsenal back on top|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/3206860.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=30 January 2014|date=26 October 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Matt|title=Extra time with Paolo Di Canio|url=http://www.votvonline.com/back-issues/memories-of-paolo/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140130134621/http://www.votvonline.com/back-issues/memories-of-paolo/|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 January 2014|publisher=Voice of the Valley|access-date=30 January 2014}}</ref> Di Canio also continued to be a provider of goals, however, notably in October 2003 when he came on as a second-half substitute with Charlton trailing 1–0 away at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. He provided most of the spark for Charlton's much-improved second-half display, and after [[Jonathan Fortune]] had equalised for Charlton, it was from Di Canio's corner kick in the last minute that [[Shaun Bartlett]] headed home the winning goal.<ref>{{cite news|title=Charlton snatch late win|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/3123632.stm|access-date=30 January 2014|date=4 October 2003|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Jimmy|title=CAFC Moments: Di Canio inspires comeback|url=http://www.cafc.co.uk/news/article/20131121-cafc-moments-paolo-di-canio-1188285.aspx|publisher=cafc.co.uk|access-date=30 January 2014|date=21 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201194633/http://www.cafc.co.uk/news/article/20131121-cafc-moments-paolo-di-canio-1188285.aspx|archive-date=1 February 2014}}</ref>

===Return to Italy===
Even though he had already signed an extension to his Charlton contract, in August 2004 he returned to his home team of [[SS Lazio|Lazio]], taking a massive pay cut in order to return to the financially stretched Roman team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/aug/06/newsstory.charltonathletic|title=Lazio offer has di Canio begging Charlton for release|website=[[TheGuardian.com]] |date=5 August 2004}}</ref> Lazio fans were happy to have a Rome-bred Lazio supporter in the team again, something missing since the departure of [[Alessandro Nesta]] in 2002. He scored in the [[Rome derby]], just as he had in 1989, leading the team to a 3–1 victory over [[AS Roma|Roma]] on 6 January 2005. However, the negative publicity that Di Canio generated for Lazio, including his intimate relationship with club's [[ultras]] and their increased influence due to his presence in the team, coupled with problems with some teammates and coaches, exasperated club president and majority shareholder, [[Claudio Lotito]], with whom he already had a difficult relationship. As a result, Di Canio's contract was not renewed in the summer of 2006. During several of his games for Lazio – including during [[goal celebration]]s – Di Canio made a fascist salute to their right-wing fans.<ref>{{cite news |title=I'm a fascist, not a racist, says Paolo di Canio |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1506262/Im-a-fascist-not-a-racist-says-Paolo-di-Canio.html |access-date=9 October 2018 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref> He subsequently signed with [[Atletico Roma FC|Cisco Roma]] of [[Serie C2]] on a free transfer. In his first season with Cisco Roma, the team finished second in the league but lost in the play-offs. He subsequently agreed to stay with Cisco for another season, in a second attempt to win promotion to [[Serie C1]] with the Roman side.

On 10 March 2008, Di Canio announced his retirement from football, ending his 23-year playing career before the end of the season because of physical issues. It was his intention to begin coaching lessons at [[Centro Tecnico Federale di Coverciano|Coverciano]] to gain a coaching position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://it.eurosport.yahoo.com/10032008/44/canio-smette-giocare-addio-cisco-roma-86.html|title=Di Canio Smette di giocare, addio alla Cisco Roma|date=10 March 2008|publisher=[[Eurosport|Yahoo!

==International career==
Di Canio was never capped for [[Italy national football team|Italy]] at senior level, although at [[Italy national under-21 football team|U21 level]] he earned eleven call-ups and nine caps between 1988 and 1990, scoring twice.<ref name="figc">{{cite web |url=https://www.figc.it/it/nazionali/nazionali-in-cifre/dettaglio-convocato/?calciatoreId=46768&squadraId=13 |title=Convocazioni e presenze in campo: DI CANIO PAOLO |publisher=FIGC |language=it |access-date=25 April 2020 }}</ref>

==Style of play==
A versatile attacker, Di Canio primarily played as a deep-lying forward, but he could also play as an attacking midfielder, or as a winger. A talented yet controversial player, Di Canio was predominantly known for his creativity, eye for goal, technical ability, and [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skills, as well as his quick feet and intelligent play on the pitch, and was described as having "an eye for the spectacular" by ''[[The Irish Times]]'' in 2001, and as a "mercurial" player by Chris Howie of [[beIN Sports]] in 2020; however, he was equally known for being inconsistent and for his temperamental character, as well as his tenacity and aggression on the pitch.<ref name="Di Canio, Paolo"/><ref name="Il Pallone Racconta: Paolo Di Canio"/><ref name="Paolo di Canio"/><ref name=tuttojuve.com/><ref name="Best Overseas Players in EPL"/><ref name="Maverick worth the risk"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/kanoute-always-happy-to-go-against-the-tide-1.274539 |title=Kanoute always happy to go against the tide |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=27 January 2001 |access-date=17 August 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.beinsports.com/en/football/news/one-of-a-kind-frederic-kanoute/1446853 |title=One of a Kind – Frederic Kanoute |publisher=beIN SPORTS |last1=Howie |first1=Chris |date=9 April 2020 |access-date=17 August 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espnfc.com/england/news/2001/0702/20010702mufcdicaniowhufc.html |title=£6m Di Canio fee floors Ferguson |work=ESPN.com |last1=Edwards |first1=John |date=2 July 2001 |access-date=17 August 2020 }} {{dead link|date=August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/1737706/2020/04/23/dicanio-carbone-pleat-sheffield-wednesday/ |title='For Benny and Paolo it didn't matter what day it was, they were gung-ho.' |work=The Athletic |last1=Frostick |first1=Nancy |date=23 April 2020 |access-date=4 June 2022 }}</ref>

Although in the 2012–13 season, Swindon were knocked out of the FA Cup and the Football League Trophy in their first games against lower-league opposition, they did have a solid run in the League Cup in which they won against three teams from higher leagues. They beat [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] 3–0, won against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] 4–3 [[Overtime (sports)|after extra time]], and beat [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] 3–1 before narrowly missing out against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] 3–2 at home.

On 18 January 2013, ahead of Swindon's Saturday clash with [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]], Di Canio worked into the night alongside approximately 200 volunteers to clear a snow-covered pitch at the [[County Ground (Swindon)|County Ground]], thus allowing the game to go ahead. He showed his appreciation by ordering the volunteers pizza. Swindon won the match 2–0, which Di Canio publicly deemed a present to the volunteers.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/01/19/paolo-di-canio-shovels-snow-off-swindon-pitch-and-orders-pizza-for-helpers-3358148/ | title=Paolo Di Canio shovels snow off Swindon pitch and orders pizza for helpers | publisher=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] | date=19 January 2013 | access-date=20 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.swindontownfc.co.uk/news/article/pdcvictoryapresent-608835.aspx | title=PDC – Victory a present | publisher=Swindon Town FC | date=19 January 2013 | access-date=20 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.swindontownfc.co.uk/news/article/shrewsgameon-607948.aspx | title=Shrewsbury game on | publisher=Swindon Town FC | date=19 January 2013 | access-date=20 January 2013}}</ref>

In January 2013, the Swindon Town chairman announced that because of financial difficulties, no money would be made available for future signings. Di Canio offered to pay £30,000 of his own money to keep loan players [[John Bostock]], [[Chris Martin (footballer, born 1988)|Chris Martin]] and [[Danny Hollands]] at the club.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paolo Di Canio offers own money to keep Swindon players|date=7 January 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20928212|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=20 January 2013}}</ref>  With the possibility of the club entering administration, a new buyer was found, subject to Football League approval, and without the knowledge of Di Canio, player [[Matt Ritchie]] was sold to [[AFC Bournemouth]]. Further attempts to sign players by Di Canio were rejected by the Football League because of the club's financial situation, with Di Canio "considering his future" at Swindon because of off-field financial problems. In February, Di Canio offered his resignation but said he would withdraw this if approval for the new owners, by the Football League, was received by 18 February. This did not happen, and he resigned as manager of Swindon Town.<ref>{{cite news |title=Paolo Di Canio quits as manager of Swindon Town |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21499926 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 February 2013 |access-date=29 March 2017}}</ref>

In 2005, he characterised his political views by declaring that he was "a [[fascist]], not a racist".<ref name="telegraphreport">{{cite news|last=Fenton |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1506262/Im-a-fascist-not-a-racist-says-Paolo-di-Canio.html |title=I'm a fascist, not a racist, says Paolo di Canio |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=24 December 2005 |access-date=1 May 2010 |location=London}}</ref>

His use of the [[Roman salute|Fascist salute]] toward [[SS Lazio|Lazio]] supporters, a gesture adopted by [[Italian fascism|Italian fascists]] in the 20th century, has created controversy.

In 2010, Di Canio attended the funeral of senior fascist [[Paolo Signorelli (politician)|Paolo Signorelli]], where mourners were photographed making mass fascist salutes towards Signorelli's coffin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/news/article/2644/paolo-di-canio-at-bomb-fascists-funeral|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406032230/http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/news/article/2644/paolo-di-canio-at-bomb-fascists-funeral|url-status=dead|title=HOPE not hate news: Paolo Di Canio at bomb fascist’s funeral<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=6 April 2013}}</ref> Signorelli had been convicted of involvement in the 1980 [[Bologna massacre]], a neo-fascist terrorist attack which killed 85 people and wounded more than 200.<ref name=Zavoli>Sergio Zavoli, ''La notte della Repubblica'', Nuova Eri, 1992 {{in lang|it}}.</ref>

Di Canio's political ideology has been a source of controversy in the course of his managerial career. When Di Canio was appointed as the manager of [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in 2011, the trade union [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] terminated its sponsorship agreement with the club, worth around £4,000 per season, because of Di Canio's fascist views.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/21/swindon-di-canio-sponsor-gmb|title=Swindon sponsor pulls out after Paolo Di Canio appointment|date=21 May 2011|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

He was appointed as manager of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 31 March 2013. The club's vice-chairman [[David Miliband]], a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician and former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|foreign secretary]], subsequently stepped down. Miliband stated that he had taken the decision to resign "in the light of the new manager's past political statements".<ref name="miliband" /> It also met opposition from the [[Durham Miners' Association]],<ref name="bbc.co.uk" /> which threatened to remove one of its mining banners from Sunderland's [[Stadium of Light]], which is built on the former site of the [[Wearmouth Colliery]], as a symbol of its anger over the appointment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tyneandwear.sky.com/news/article/62109/durham-miners-association-our-issues-with-di-canio-now-resolved |title=Durham Miners' Association: Our Issues With Di Canio at Sunderland Now Resolved |last=Daunt |first=Joe |website=Sky Tyne and Wear |access-date=24 April 2013 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625103549/http://tyneandwear.sky.com/news/article/62109/durham-miners-association-our-issues-with-di-canio-now-resolved |archive-date=25 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/02/paolo-di-canio-sunderland-miners-banner | website=The Guardian | first=Matthew | last=Taylor | title=Sunderland miners demand return of banner after Paolo Di Canio's arrival | date=2 April 2013 | access-date=2 April 2013}}</ref>

In a profile piece in 2011, an unnamed source asserted that Di Canio was not "an ideological fascist", attributing his behaviour to "his psychological history, particularly his former compulsive tendencies and pronounced mood swings". In the same article, Di Canio said that he was not politically active: "I don't vote, I haven't voted for 14 years. Italian politicians — all of them — think only about themselves, and making money."<ref name="independentarticle" />

==Personal life==
Di Canio has several tattoos, including on his right [[biceps]] the [[Latin language|Latin]] word "''DUX''", meaning "''leader''" or, in Italian, [[duce|Il Duce]]—a nickname for [[Benito Mussolini]].<ref name=Tatts>{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/sports/political%2Bfootball%2Bpaolo%2Bdi%2Bcanio/1643547.html |title=Political Football: Paolo Di Canio|date=26 April 2008|publisher=Channel 4 |access-date=19 May 2011}}</ref> [[Sky Italia|Sky Sports Italia]] was forced to apologise after Di Canio appeared as a pundit in September 2016 in a short-sleeved shirt, thus revealing the tattoo to television viewers; he was later suspended by the station.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/14/sky-sport-italia-suspends-paolo-di-canio-after-showing-dux-tattoo|title=Sky Sport Italia suspends Paolo Di Canio after showing 'dux' tattoo|last=Dobson|first=Mark|date=14 September 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref> His back is covered with a tattoo of fascist imagery, including an eagle, [[fasces]], and a portrait of Mussolini.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/football/sheffield-wednesday/latest-owls-news/mussolini-tattoos-and-fascist-salutes-troubling-political-history-former-sheffield-wednesday-forward-paolo-di-canio-1306644|title=Mussolini tattoos and fascist salutes: The troubling political history of former Sheffield Wednesday forward Paolo Di Canio|website=www.thestar.co.uk|date=19 November 2019 }}</ref> He also has a [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] tattoo on his left upper arm<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hammers.news/columnist/where-are-they-now-paolo-di-canio/|title=Where Are They Now?

Di Canio has spoken also of the growing influence in his life of [[Samurai]] culture, and of the Japanese spiritual mentality from reading [[Yukio Mishima|Mishima]], and the teachings in the traditions of [[Hagakure]] and [[Bushido]].<ref name="independent1"/>
