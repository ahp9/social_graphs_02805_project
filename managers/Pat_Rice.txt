==Playing career==

===Arsenal===
Born in [[Belfast]], Rice grew up in London where he attended Gifford Street Primary School as a young boy. He later on worked at a greengrocers on [[Gillespie Road]] which is the street [[Highbury Stadium]] is upon. Veering toward the sport of football, Rice joined [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] as an apprentice in 1964. He turned professional in 1966 and worked his way up as a defender through the club's youth and reserve teams. Rice thereafter made his first-team debut in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 5 December 1967, a match that Arsenal won 2–1.<ref name=Arsenal>{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/profiles/565/pat-rice|title=Pat Rice|website=Arsenal.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522141556/http://www.arsenal.com/history/profiles/565/pat-rice|archive-date=22 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=Feature>{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/features/20170209/pat-rice|title=Defining Moments: Pat Rice|website=Arsenal.com}}</ref>

Playing in particular as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]], Rice was initially a bit-part player, making only 16 appearances in his first three seasons at Arsenal. He also went on to miss out on Arsenal's [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1969-70|1969–70]] [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] win over [[RSC Anderlecht]]. However, during this time he won his first cap for [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]], against [[Israel national football team|Israel]] on 10 September 1968, while still largely a reserve player. [[Peter Storey]] was Arsenal's first choice right back, but he was soon moved into central midfield at the start of the [[1970–71 in English football|1970–71]] season. With this being so, Rice took his place and was a near-ever present figure in the side of that season, as Arsenal won the [[Football League Division One|League]] and [[FA Cup]] [[Double (association football)|Double]].<ref name=Arsenal /><ref name=Feature />
Rice remained first-choice right back for the club as he played in the [[1972 FA Cup final]] as well. He was also a regular injury free presence for three full seasons being [[1971–72 in English football|1971–72]], [[1975–76 in English football|1975–76]] & [[1976–77 in English football|1976–77]]. Of the Double-winning side, he was the one who remained at the club the longest, taking up the role as club captain in 1977. As captain, Rice had the honour of lifting the FA Cup after Arsenal beat [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in [[1979 FA Cup Final|1979]], as well as losing two finals in [[1978 FA Cup Final|1978]] and [[1980 FA Cup Final|1980]]. He is one of only 3 Arsenal players to have played in five FA Cup Finals (1970–71, 1971–72, 1977–78, 1978–79, 1979–80), the other two being [[David Seaman]] and [[Ray Parlour]]. He also led Arsenal to the [[1980 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final]], which Arsenal lost on penalties to [[Valencia CF|Valencia]].<ref name=Arsenal /><ref name=Feature />

Rice continued to play for Northern Ireland in this time, amassing 49 caps in an eleven-year career, which ended with his final international game against [[England national football team|England]] on 17 October 1979, which ended in a 5–1 defeat. Rice finally left Arsenal in 1980 at the age of 31, by which time he had played 528 games in total for the club.<ref name=Arsenal /><ref name=Feature />

===Watford===
He moved to [[Graham Taylor]]'s [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] where he helped the club as captain gain promotion to the First Division in [[1981–82 in English football|1981–82]]. Rice scored in Watford's first game in the top flight in 1982–83 against Everton before retiring from playing in 1984. In his final season he helped Watford reach the [[1984 FA Cup final]]. After [[Wilf Rostron]] was suspended for the game Rice was considered to replace him but was ultimately left out of the squad.<ref>{{cite news

==Coaching career==
Rice rejoined Arsenal in 1984 as youth team coach, a post he held for the next 12 years, winning the [[FA Youth Cup]] twice in [[1987–88 in English football|1987–88]] and [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94]]. In September 1996, Rice was briefly caretaker manager of the club after the resignation of [[Stewart Houston]], who himself was caretaker after the sacking of [[Bruce Rioch]]. He managed the side for three [[FA Premier League]] matches (all of which Arsenal won) and a 3–2 defeat in the [[UEFA Cup]] at home to [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]].

Upon the arrival of [[Arsène Wenger]] at the end of the month, Rice became his assistant, and played a key role in helping the club to their success in the 1990s and 2000s, including the Doubles of [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]] and [[2001–02 in English football|2001–02]], and Arsenal's unbeaten League season of [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]]. He holds the distinction (along with [[Bob Wilson (footballer born 1941)|Bob Wilson]]) of having taken part, as player or coach, in all three of Arsenal's Doubles.

On 5 May 2012, it was announced that Rice would be stepping down after an accumulative 44 years with club, since joining as an apprentice, with the home game against Norwich being his final home game as Arsenal No.2. Wenger stated, "Pat is a true Arsenal legend and has committed almost his whole life to Arsenal Football Club, which shows huge loyalty and devotion to this club...I will always be indebted to him for his expert insight into Arsenal and football as a whole. On the training pitches and on matchdays, Pat has always been a passionate, loyal and insightful colleague, who we will all miss." His replacement was former Arsenal player [[Steve Bould]].<ref name=retirement/>

Rice was appointed Member of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to sport.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=60367 |date=29 December 2012 |page=22 |supp=y}}</ref><ref name=MBE>{{cite web|title=Pat Rice receives MBE in Honours List|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/pat-rice-receives-mbe-in-honours-list|publisher=Arsenal.com|access-date=29 December 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231173305/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/pat-rice-receives-mbe-in-honours-list|archive-date=31 December 2012}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Pat Rice started training at Arsenal at age 14 and would spend all his spare time developing his fitness and football skills. Jon Sammels memory of Rice as a schoolboy who once requested Sammels autograph, "He [Pat] used to live down the road and his brother, Alf used to have the hairdressers at the bottom of Avenell Road where a lot of the lads used to get their hair cut. Pat was always outside kicking a ball around".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Gary|date=2019-08-23|title=Arsenal for life: local lad and Highbury Legend – the one and only Pat Rice|url=https://www.gunnerstown.com/arsenal/2019/08/23/arsenal-for-life-local-lad-and-highbury-legend-the-one-and-only-pat-rice/|access-date=2020-10-21|website=Gunners Town|language=en-US}}</ref> Getty images pictured Rice, with his wife Betty holding son Stephen as a child, taken at their Cockfosters home in 1975.<ref>{{Cite web|title=circa 1975, Arsenal's Pat Rice at home with his wife Betty and son...|url=https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/circa-1975-arsenals-pat-rice-at-home-with-his-wife-betty-news-photo/78992908|access-date=2020-10-21|website=Getty Images|date=15 January 2008 |language=en-gb}}</ref> In the 1970s Rice co-wrote a regular football column with Steve Stammers for [[The Evening News (London newspaper)|The Evening News]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stammers|first=Steve|date=2013-12-04|title=Pat Rice will fight cancer all the way – and his record shows that he can pull through|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/pat-rice-fight-way---2881106|access-date=2020-10-21|website=mirror}}</ref>
