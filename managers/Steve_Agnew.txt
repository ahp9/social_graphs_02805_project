'''Stephen Mark Agnew''' (born 9 November 1965) is an English football coach and former professional [[Association football|footballer]]. He was most recently the assistant head coach to the former [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] manager, [[Steve Bruce]]. 

As a player, he was a [[midfielder]] from 1983 to 2002, notably in the [[Premier League]] for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], and in the [[Football League|Football league]] for [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[York City F.C.|York City]] before finishing his career in non-League with [[Gateshead F.C.|Gateshead]].

He has since worked as a coach in a variety roles at Gateshead, [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool Utd]], [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]].

==Playing career==
Agnew was born in [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]],<ref name="Hugman2001/02"/> though grew up in [[Barnsley]]. He started his career at [[Barnsley F.C.]], staying there for eight years after turning professional and making over 200 appearances. 

He was sold to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for a £700,000 fee in June 1991 – making him the [[Ewood Park]] club's most costly signing at the time, just after wealthy owner [[Jack Walker]] bought the club.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Profile: Money, money, money man - Jack Walker |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/profile-money-money-money-man-jack-walker-1540594.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221106093340/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/profile-money-money-money-man-jack-walker-1540594.html |archive-date=2022-11-06 |access-date=2025-01-03 |work=The Independent |language=en-GB}}</ref> His spell at Blackburn was unsuccessful, only making four appearances before he joined [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on loan and then [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] permanently in the [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93]] season, when Rovers were in the new [[Premier League]] and Leicester were challenging for promotion from Division One. During his time at Blackburn, the club earned promotion to the Premier League, but Agnew's part in the success was a minimal one as the attention was focused on big-money new signings such as [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]] and [[Roy Wegerle]] and later [[Alan Shearer]] and [[Stuart Ripley]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} 

One of Agnew's most memorable nights in a Leicester City shirt was 15 April 1993, when Leicester beat Millwall 3–0. Agnew scored and was sent off. Agnew "reacted angrily to a heavy challenge by Andy Roberts. At least a dozen players jostled each other as police, stewards and the respective managers tried to restore order. Agnew, who had already been cautioned, appeared to lash out at a Millwall player, leaving Mr Parker no option other than to reach for red. Millwall tried hard to exploit their numerical advantage, only for the home team to score again through [[David Oldfield (footballer)|David Oldfield]]."<ref>{{cite news |first=Phil |last=Shaw |title=Football: Leicester maul Millwall |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-leicester-maul-millwall-1455449.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220525/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-leicester-maul-millwall-1455449.html |archive-date=25 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=15 April 1993 |access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref> He was part of the Leicester team that won promotion to the Premier League as Division One play-off winners in 1994.<ref>{{Cite web |title=All Leicester City players: 1994 |url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/leicester-city/tab/players/season/1994/ |access-date=2025-01-03 |website=www.11v11.com}}</ref>

Agnew then moved north to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], helping them win promotion to the Premier League as Division One champions in 1996, although they went down after just one season. In 1998 he signed for [[York City F.C.|York City]] and despite his efforts the [[Bootham Crescent]] team were unable to avoid relegation from Division Two in the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99]] season.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Football Club History Database - York City |url=https://fchd.info/YORKC.HTM |access-date=2025-01-03 |website=fchd.info}}</ref> Agnew spent the 2001–02 season playing for [[Gateshead F.C.|Gateshead]], where he finished his playing career.<ref>{{Cite web |date=3 January 2025 |title=Unofficial Gateshead Football Club Statistics Database |url=http://gfcstats.webs.com/0102.htm |access-date=3 January 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109193836/http://gfcstats.webs.com/0102.htm |archive-date=9 January 2014 }}</ref>
