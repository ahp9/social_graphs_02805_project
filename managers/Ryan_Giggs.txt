The son of [[rugby union]] and [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] international [[rugby league]] footballer [[Danny Wilson (rugby league)|Danny Wilson]], Giggs was born in [[Cardiff]] but moved to [[Manchester]] at the age of six when his father joined [[Swinton Lions|Swinton RLFC]]. Predominantly a [[Midfielder#Wide midfielder|left midfielder]], he began his career with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], but joined Manchester United on his 14th birthday in 1987. He made his professional debut for the club in 1991 and spent the next 23 years in the first team. He retired from playing with the end of the 2013–14 season, holding the club record for competitive appearances – [[List of Manchester United F.C. records and statistics#Appearances|963]]. Towards the end of the [[2013–14 Manchester United F.C. season|2013–14 season]], he became the club's interim player-manager following the sacking of [[David Moyes]]. He was assistant manager under Moyes' permanent replacement, [[Louis van Gaal]].

Giggs was the first player in history to win two consecutive [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] awards (1992 and 1993), though he did not win the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year|PFA Player of the Year]] award until 2009.

== Early years ==
Giggs was born at [[St David's Hospital, Cardiff|St David's Hospital]] in [[Canton, Cardiff]], to [[Danny Wilson (rugby)|Danny Wilson]], a [[rugby union]] player for [[Cardiff RFC]], and Lynne Giggs (now Lynne Johnson). Giggs is [[mixed race]] – his paternal grandfather is a [[Sierra Leone Creole]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://footbalium.com/lifestyle/biography/9986-ryan-giggs-biography/ |title=Ryan Giggs Biography|website=www.footbalium.com}}</ref> – and has spoken of the racism he faced as a child.<ref>{{cite news |title=Giggs suffered racist abuse |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/giggs-suffered-racist-abuse-949583 |work=Manchester Evening News |date=20 April 2010 |access-date=28 October 2020 }}</ref> As a child, Giggs grew up in [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]], a suburb of western Cardiff. His younger brother, Rhodri, is a former manager of [[EFL League Two]] club [[Salford City F.C.|Salford City]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rhodri Giggs resigns from Salford City|url=https://www.salfordstar.com/article.asp?id=1347|access-date=7 November 2020|website=salfordstar.com}}</ref>

He spent much time with his mother's parents and playing football and rugby league on the roads outside their house in [[Pentrebane]]. In 1980, when Giggs was six years old, his father switched from rugby union to rugby league, and signed for [[Swinton Lions|Swinton RLFC]], forcing the whole family to move north to [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]], a town in [[City of Salford|Salford]], Greater Manchester. The move was a traumatic one, as Giggs was very close to his grandparents in Cardiff, but he would often return there with his family at weekends or on school holidays.

After moving to Salford, Giggs appeared for the local team, Deans FC, who were coached by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] scout Dennis Schofield. Schofield recommended Giggs to Manchester City, and he was signed up to their School of Excellence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11096/10188819/ryan-giggs-25-years-at-manchester-united|title=Ryan Giggs: 25 years at Manchester United|work=Sky Sports }}</ref> Meanwhile, Giggs continued to play for Salford Boys, who went on to reach the final of the Granada Schools Cup competition at [[Anfield]] in 1987. Giggs captained the Salford team to victory over their Blackburn counterparts, was [[man of the match]], and the trophy was presented to him by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] chief scout [[Ron Yeats]].<ref>{{cite video |title=Young Ryan Giggs (Wilson), 1988 Granada Schools Cup |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ofa78rqIuQ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/5ofa78rqIuQ |archive-date=30 October 2021 |access-date=29 September 2012 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> Giggs also played [[rugby league]] at schoolboy level.<ref>{{cite news |first=Neil |last=Barker |title=Adrian Morley inspired by Reds legends |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/rugby_league/s/1590323_adrian-morley-inspired-by-reds-legends |work=Manchester Evening News |date=3 October 2012 |access-date=27 October 2013 }}</ref>

While playing for Deans, Giggs was observed regularly by local newsagent and [[Old Trafford]] steward Harold Wood. Wood spoke personally to [[Alex Ferguson]] who sent a scout, and Giggs was eventually offered a trial over the 1986 Christmas period. Giggs played in a match for Salford Boys against a United Under-15s side at [[The Cliff (training ground)|The Cliff]] and scored a [[hat-trick]], with Ferguson watching from his office window. On 29 November 1987 (his 14th birthday), Ferguson turned up at Giggs' house with United scout Joe Brown and offered him two years on associate schoolboy forms. They offered to waive [[Youth Training Scheme|YTS]] forms and persuaded Giggs to sign by offering the opportunity to turn professional in three years. Using the name Ryan Wilson, Giggs captained England at [[England national under-16 football team|schoolboy level]], playing at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] against [[Germany national youth football team|Germany]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Mike |last1=Adamson |first2=John |last2=Ashdown |title=Could Ryan Giggs have played for England? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/oct/06/theknowledge.sport |work=The Guardian |date=6 October 2004 |access-date=23 August 2010 }}</ref> He changed his surname to that of his mother at the age of 16, when his mother remarried, two years after his parents' separation.<ref>{{cite news |first=Rob |last=Hughes |title=Ferguson and Giggs, side by side at ManU |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/sports/03iht-SOCCER.1.20556079.html?pagewanted=2 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=3 March 2009 |access-date=27 May 2011 }}</ref>

== Manchester United ==

=== 1990–1995: Debut and early career ===
Giggs was offered his first professional contract on 29 November 1990 (his 17th birthday). He accepted the contract and became a professional two days later (1 December 1990).

At this time, United had recently won the [[FA Cup]] – their first major trophy since the appointment of [[Alex Ferguson]] as manager in November 1986. After two seasons in the league where they had finished mid-table, they were finally starting to threaten the dominance of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], though they only managed to finish sixth that season. Ferguson's quest for a successful left-winger had not been an easy one since the departure of [[Jesper Olsen]] two years earlier; he had initially signed [[Ralph Milne]], but the player was not a success at United and lasted just one season in the first team before Ferguson secured the [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] winger [[Danny Wallace (footballer)|Danny Wallace]] in September 1989. Wallace had failed to shine at Old Trafford, and by the time Giggs turned professional Wallace was contending with 19-year-old [[Lee Sharpe]] for the role of first-choice left winger.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Giggs made his League debut against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at [[Old Trafford]] on 2 March 1991, as a substitute for the injured full-back [[Denis Irwin]] in a 2–0 defeat.<ref name="Giggs1000"/> In his first full start, Giggs was credited with his first-ever goal in a 1–0 win in the [[Manchester derby]] on 4 May 1991, though it appeared to be a [[Colin Hendry]] own goal. However, he was not included in the squad of 16 that defeated [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] final 11 days later. Lee Sharpe, who had won the race to displace Danny Wallace, took to the field as United's left winger, while Wallace was selected as a substitute. Giggs became a first-team regular early in the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92 season]], yet remained active with the youth system and captained the team, made up of many of "[[Fergie's Fledglings]]," to an [[FA Youth Cup]] triumph in 1992. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Giggs paved the way as the first of many Manchester United youth players to rise into the first team under Ferguson but as the youngest member of the United first-team squad, Giggs looked to the older players such as [[Bryan Robson]] for advice. Robson recommended that Giggs sign up with Harry Swales, the agent that he himself had inherited from [[Kevin Keegan]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Fordyce |title=The teenage tornado |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/3257103.stm |website=BBC Sport |date=12 November 2003 |access-date=17 May 2009 }}</ref>

That season, Giggs played in the team that finished as runners-up to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in the final year of the old [[Football League First Division|First Division]] before the advent of the [[Premier League]]. United had led the table for much of the season before a run of dismal results in April saw them overtaken by the [[West Yorkshire]] side. Giggs collected his first piece of silverware on 12 April 1992 as United defeated [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in the [[1992 Football League Cup Final|League Cup Final]] after Giggs had set up [[Brian McClair]] to score the only goal of the game. In the semi-final he had scored the winning goal against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-boro-draw-brings-10125449|title=Manchester United - Boro: Draw brings back memories of a rain-lashed League Cup tie|publisher=gazettelive.co.uk|date=24 September 2015 |access-date=8 February 2022}}</ref> At the end of the season, he was voted [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] – the award which had been credited to his colleague Lee Sharpe a year earlier.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

By the start of the [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93]] season, the first season of the newly formed [[Premier League]], Giggs had ousted Sharpe to become United's first-choice left-winger. He was recognised as one of English football's two best emerging young wingers, alongside [[Steve McManaman]],<ref name="wing">{{cite web |title=Steve McManaman Profile |url=http://www.givemefootball.com/player-profiles/steve-mcmanaman |publisher=Give Me Football |access-date=19 December 2010 |archive-date=11 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711100043/http://www.givemefootball.com/player-profiles/steve-mcmanaman |url-status=dead }}</ref> who were notable for being a throwback to the [[Stanley Matthews]] era of the 1950s winger.<ref>{{cite news |title=Might of the midfielders |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1433721.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=11 July 2001 |access-date=19 December 2010 }}</ref> Giggs helped United to their first top-division title win for 26 years.

His emergence and the arrival of [[Eric Cantona]] heralded the dominance of United in the Premier League. Ferguson was protective of him, refusing to allow Giggs to be interviewed until he turned 20, eventually granting the first interview to the [[BBC]]'s [[Des Lynam]] for ''[[Match of the Day]]'' in the [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94]] season.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} United won the double that season, and Giggs was one of their key players alongside the likes of Cantona, [[Paul Ince]] and [[Mark Hughes]]. Giggs also played for United in the [[Football League Cup]] final, where they lost 3–1 to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].

Off the pitch, newspapers claimed Giggs had "single-handedly revolutionised football's image" when he appeared as a teenager "with pace to burn, a bramble patch of black hair bouncing around his puppy popstar face, and a dazzling, gluey relationship between his impossibly fleet left foot and a football."<ref>{{cite web |title=Ryan Giggs is still smiling after surviving the bitter battles with Arsenal |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-sport/interviews/article-23906401-ryan-giggs-is-still-smiling-after-surviving-the-bitter-battles-with-arsenal.do |work=Evening Standard |location=London |date=13 December 2010 |access-date=19 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216172605/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-sport/interviews/article-23906401-ryan-giggs-is-still-smiling-after-surviving-the-bitter-battles-with-arsenal.do |archive-date=16 December 2010 }}</ref> As a result of this, he was afforded many opportunities not normally offered to footballers at his young age, such as hosting his television show, ''Ryan Giggs' Soccer Skills'', which aired in 1994, and also had a book based on the series. Giggs was part of the Premier League's attempt to market itself globally, and he featured on countless football and [[lad mag]] covers, becoming a household name and fuelling the era where footballers started to become celebrity idols on a par with [[pop stars]],<ref>{{cite web|title=How football became the new rock'n'roll – Rock'n'Goal Week |url=http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/rockngoal/archive/2009/04/22/how-football-became-the-new-rock-n-roll.aspx |publisher=FourFourTwo |date=22 April 2009 |access-date=19 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711021611/http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/rockngoal/archive/2009/04/22/how-football-became-the-new-rock-n-roll.aspx |archive-date=11 July 2011 }}</ref> in and around the mid to late 1990s.

Giggs proved to be a scorer of great goals, with many of them being shortlisted for various [[BBC Goal of the Season|Goal of the Season]] awards. Widely regarded as among his best were those against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in 1994, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] in 1994, [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 1995, [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry]] in 1996, and his solo effort against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the replay of the 1999 [[FA Cup]] semi-final.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} During extra time, Giggs picked up possession after [[Patrick Vieira]] gave the ball away, then ran from his own half, dribbled past the whole Arsenal back line, including [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]], [[Lee Dixon]] and [[Martin Keown]] before launching his left-footed strike just under [[David Seaman]]'s bar and beyond his reach. He famously whipped off his shirt during his [[goal celebration]] as he ran over to his teammates. It also has the distinction of being the last ever goal scored in an [[FA Cup]] semi-final replay as, from the following season, the [[FA Cup]] semi-finals are decided in a single game, with [[extra time]] and a [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] if required.<ref>{{cite news |title=No more second chances |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/319935.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=15 April 1999 |access-date=8 April 2014 }}</ref>

=== 1995–2000 ===
[[1994–95 in English football|1994–95]] saw Giggs restricted through injury to 29 Premier League games and only 1 goal. Later in the season, he recovered his form and fitness, though it was too late to help United to any major trophies. A failure to beat [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on the final day of the season saw them lose the Premier League title to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. A week later, Giggs came on as a substitute in the FA Cup final against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], but United lost 1–0.

On a more positive side in the 1994–95 season, Giggs did get on the scoresheet twice in the opening Champions League game against [[IFK Göteborg]] (a 4–2 win, although United ultimately failed to progress to the quarter-finals) and also managed a goal in the [[FA Cup]] fourth-round victory over [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]], meaning that he had managed four goals in all competitions that season.

In [[1995–96 in English football|1995–96]], Giggs returned to full form and played a vital part in United's unique second [[Double (association football)|double]], with his goal against Everton at [[Goodison Park]] on 9 September 1995 being shortlisted for the "goal of the season" award, though it was eventually beaten by a goal by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]'s [[Georgi Kinkladze]]. In November that season, Giggs scored two goals in a Premier League match against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], where United won 4–1 to keep up the pressure on a [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] side who actually went ten points clear on 23 December but were finally overhauled by United in mid-March. Giggs was also in the side for United's FA Cup final win over Liverpool on 11 May 1996, though [[Eric Cantona]] scored the only goal of the game. By now, Giggs had several new key colleagues in youngsters [[Gary Neville]], [[Phil Neville]], [[Nicky Butt]], [[David Beckham]] and [[Paul Scholes]]. Beckham took over from Andrei Kanchelskis on the right-wing and Butt succeeded Paul Ince in central midfield to complete a new look United midfield along with Giggs and Roy Keane.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[1996–97 in English football|The following season]], Giggs had his first real chance to shine in Europe. Having played a key role in United winning their third league title in four seasons, he helped them reach the [[1996–97 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] semi-finals, the first United side in 28 years to achieve this. However, their hopes of European glory were ended by [[Borussia Dortmund]], who edged them out by winning each leg of the semi-final 1–0. At the end of this season, [[Juventus FC|Juventus]]' [[Alessandro Del Piero]] told Italian media that Giggs was one of his two favourite players.<ref name="MostImportant"/>

In [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]], United were pipped to the Premier League title by Arsenal, following a dismal run of form in March and early April, leaving them without a trophy for only the second time since 1989. The following season, Giggs missed a lot of games through injury, but when he was fit his form was excellent and he played in both of United's cup finals that season. Memorable moments were his extra-time goal in the FA Cup semi-final against arch-rivals [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] giving United a 2–1 win,<ref>{{cite news |title=Giggs magic sinks Gunners |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/fa_cup/319696.stm |website=BBC Sport |date=14 April 1999 |access-date=7 August 2014 }}</ref> and his 90th-minute equaliser in the home leg of the [[1997–98 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] semi-final against Juventus.

The highpoint in the [[1998–99 Manchester United F.C. season|1998–99 season]] was when Giggs set up the equalising goal scored by [[Teddy Sheringham]] in the [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final]] that set United on their way to [[Treble (association football)|the Treble]].

Giggs was also the Man of the Match as United beat [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]] 1–0 to claim the [[Intercontinental Cup (1960–2004)|Intercontinental Cup]] later that year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd crowned world champions |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/543368.stm |website=BBC Sport |date=30 November 1999 |access-date=16 May 2011}}</ref>

=== 2000–2005 ===
Giggs became [[Manchester United F.C.|United]]'s longest-serving player when [[Denis Irwin]] left in May 2002, and he became a pivotal part of the club, despite still being in his 20s. Giggs continued to excel in the four years that followed the [[The Treble|Treble]] triumph of 1999. United were [[Premier League]] champions in three of the four seasons following the treble, as well as reaching the [[UEFA Champions League]] quarter-finals three times and the semi-finals once. In April 2001, he signed a new five-year contract.<ref>{{cite news |title=Giggs agrees new five-year deal |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/3002517/Giggs-agrees-new-five-year-deal.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/3002517/Giggs-agrees-new-five-year-deal.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |work=The Telegraph |date=4 April 2001 |access-date=8 August 2014 }}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Giggs celebrated his 10-year anniversary at [[Old Trafford]] with a testimonial match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at the start of the [[2001–02 in English football|2001–02]] campaign, losing 4–3 in a game featuring a cameo by [[Eric Cantona]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Celtic too strong for Man Utd |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1467634.stm |website=BBC Sport |date=1 August 2001 |access-date=8 August 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Walker |title=Feisty Celtic give Giggs a night to remember |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/aug/02/newsstory.sport3 |work=The Guardian |date=2 August 2001 |access-date=8 August 2014 }}</ref> However, this was one of the most disappointing seasons United had endured since Giggs made his debut, as a dismal run of form in early winter ultimately cost them the league title and they were surprisingly knocked out of the Champions League on away goals in the semi-finals by German underdogs [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]].

=== 2005–2010 ===
[[File:Giggs cropped.jpg|thumb|left|As his career progressed, Giggs abandoned his position on the left wing for a more central role.]]

Giggs signed a two-year contract extension with United when chief executive [[David Gill (executive)|David Gill]] relented on his normal policy of not signing players over 30 to contracts longer than one year. Giggs benefited from being largely injury-free aside from a series of [[hamstring]] problems.

Giggs scored his first goal of the [[2006–07 Manchester United F.C. season|2006–07]] season in a 2–1 victory over Watford on 26 August 2006, with his goal proving to be the winner.<ref>{{cite news |first=Caroline |last=Cheese |title=Watford 1–2 Man Utd |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/5266280.stm |website=BBC Sport |date=26 August 2006 |access-date=8 August 2014 }}</ref> Giggs scored the winner in United's next game, a 1–0 home victory over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 9 September, scoring a header in the eighth minute.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Taylor |title=Giggs and sloppy Spurs get United believing again |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/sep/11/match.sport3 |work=The Guardian |date=11 September 2006 |access-date=8 August 2014 }}</ref> Giggs provided a goal and an assist in the final Champions League group game against [[S.L.

In his one year with the England Schoolboys team, Giggs played nine times, all as captain, winning seven matches and losing twice.<ref>Giggs (2006), p. 24.</ref> Among the wins was a 4–0 victory over his Welsh peers, many of whom he would play alongside when he made the step up to the Welsh youth team the following year.<ref>Giggs (2006), p. 25.</ref>

=== Wales ===
[[File:Giggs wales x brazil.JPG|thumb|upright|Giggs played for [[Wales national football team|Wales]] 64 times, but never at a major international tournament.]]
In May 1991, Giggs made his debut for the Wales Under-21s, a 2–1 victory over [[Poland national under-21 football team|Poland]] in Warsaw.<ref>Giggs (2006), p. 45.</ref> It would turn out to be his only appearance for the team, as he received a call-up to the senior team later that year.

Giggs' first senior goal for Wales came on 31 March 1993 in a 3–0 win over [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in [[Cardiff]] in a [[1994 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifying game, the same game in which [[Ian Rush]] scored for Wales for a record 24th time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.faw.cymru/en/news/ryan-giggs-top-5-moments-wales|title=Ryan Giggs - Top 5 moment for Wales|website=faw.cymru|date=16 January 2018|access-date=15 December 2022}}</ref>

If the international was a friendly, the feeling was that I didn't have to play."<ref>Giggs (2006), p. 124.</ref> Regardless, his regularly withdrawing from Wales squads and routinely missing friendlies was criticised.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42684241|title=Ryan Giggs: Manchester United legend set to be named Wales manager|website=BBC Sport|date=14 January 2018|access-date=14 January 2018}}</ref>

In September 2006, he played in a friendly against Brazil at [[White Hart Lane]] where Wales lost 2–0.

A skilful and dynamic left-footed midfielder, Giggs usually played as a traditional out-and-out [[Midfielder#Wide midfielder|left-sided midfielder]], who would take on opposing defenders, although he was a versatile player, who was capable of playing on either flank, as well as in several other positions; throughout his career he was also fielded in various offensive roles, as a left or right-sided [[Winger (association football)|winger]] or [[outside forward]] in an attacking trident, as an [[attacking midfielder]], as a [[deep-lying forward]], or even as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]]. In the later stages of his career, as his pace and athleticism declined, he was often used as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive]] or [[central midfielder]], or as a [[deep-lying playmaker]]; he was even deployed as a [[full-back (association football)|full-back]] on occasion. A quick and technically gifted player, in his prime, his main traits were his speed, acceleration, strength, ball control, flair, [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skills, and trickery in possession, as well as his vision; he also was able to refine his [[Cross (association football)|crossing]] and passing ability as his career progressed, which made him an excellent [[Assist (association football)|assist]] provider, and saw him take on more of a [[Playmaker|playmaking]] role for his team in later years, which enabled him to dictate play in midfield and create chances for teammates, in addition to scoring goals himself. A fast and energetic player, he also drew praise in the media for his tactical intelligence, movement, stamina, work-rate, and consistency; furthermore, he was an accurate [[Free kick (association football)|free kick]] taker.
