'''Christopher Patrick Coleman''' {{post nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (born 10 June 1970) is a Welsh professional [[Association football|football]] coach and former [[Association football|player]]. He is the current manager of [[Super League Greece|Greek Super League]] club [[Asteras Tripolis F.C.|Asteras Tripolis]].

As a player, Coleman usually played in [[Defender (association football)|defence]], while also occasionally appearing as a forward. He began his career at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], leaving as a teenager to make his debut for hometown team [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in 1987. In 1991, he joined [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], whom he represented in the [[Premier League]]. He spent a year-and-a-half at league champions [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] before signing for [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 1997, helping the team to two promotions from the third tier to the top flight. He won 32 [[Caps (sport)|caps]] playing for [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. Coleman's playing career ended at the age of 32, when his leg was broken in a car crash.
[[File:Welsh Government video of Chris Coleman at St David Awards 2016.webm|thumb|270px|Coleman at the [[St David Awards]] in 2016]]

Following this, he started his coaching career at Fulham. In his first full season as manager, he guided the club to ninth place in the [[2003–04 Premier League]]. After leaving Fulham, Coleman was appointed manager of [[Real Sociedad]], where he resigned in January 2008 due to differences with the incoming president. He returned to England to manage [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], but was dismissed in May 2010 following a poor run of results. Coleman then managed Greek side [[Athlitiki Enosi Larissa F.C.|AEL]] for the first half of the 2011–12 season before resigning due to financial troubles at the club. In 2012, he took over as [[Wales national football team|Wales national team]] manager after the death of [[Gary Speed]], and led Wales to [[UEFA Euro 2016]], their first major tournament since the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]], where they made the semi-finals.

==Early life==
Coleman was born in [[Swansea]].<ref name="Hugman2001-02"/> His Irish father was from [[Dublin]].<ref name="auto">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39298989 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318084605/http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39298989 | archive-date=18 March 2017 | title=World Cup qualifiers: Wales manager Chris Coleman's Irish connection | work=BBC Sport }}</ref>

Coleman was educated at St Joseph's Roman Catholic Primary School and [[Bishop Vaughan Catholic School]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Chris Coleman offered freedom of home city Swansea after Wales' Euro 2016 heroics|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/chris-coleman-offered-freedom-home-11630262|publisher=[[WalesOnline]]|date=18 July 2016}}</ref> Coleman has been nicknamed "Cookie" since childhood, as friends likened his eating habits to the [[Cookie Monster]] from ''[[Sesame Street]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Welton |first1=Blake |title=WATCH: Chris Coleman calls for a united Wales during North Wales visit |url=https://www.dailypost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/watch-chris-coleman-calls-united-8173684 |access-date=24 February 2021 |work=Daily Post |date=25 November 2014 |quote=The Wales manager also shed light on the origins of "Cookie", the nickname from his playing days, revealing it was from popular Children's TV show 'Sesame Street'.  With a wry smile Chris Coleman said: "I was quite a big young boy and my friends called me Cookie Monster as I was forever eating biscuits and chocolate bars and that's where it stuck."}}</ref>

==Playing career==
===Club===
====Swansea City====
The first professional team Coleman was contracted to was [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], aged 16, although he later left them, citing homesickness as the major reason.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/16/newsstory.sport9|title=Coleman in frame for City job|author=Taylor, Daniel|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=16 March 2007|access-date=24 August 2015}}</ref> He then joined his hometown club [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]].<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Dulin|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_of_wales/7750489.stm|title=Coleman misses Vetch Field derbies|work=BBC Sport|date=27 November 2008|access-date=24 August 2015}}</ref>

He made his first professional appearance for them aged 17, in the autumn of 1987. He made nearly 200 appearances for the south Wales club and helped win the [[Welsh Cup]] in 1989 and 1991.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wfda.co.uk/welshcup_final_detail.php?id=102 |title=Swansea City 5–0 Kidderminster Harriers |publisher=Welsh Football Data Archive |access-date=10 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416180806/http://wfda.co.uk/welshcup_final_detail.php?id=102 |archive-date=16 April 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wfda.co.uk/welshcup_final_detail.php?id=104 |title=Swansea City 2–0 Wrexham |publisher=Welsh Football Data Archive |access-date=10 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330191009/http://www.wfda.co.uk/welshcup_final_detail.php?id=104 |archive-date=30 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Crystal Palace====
After spending four years with Swansea, Coleman was signed by [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in 1991 for a transfer fee set by a Football League tribunal at around £270,000, plus a percentage of any future sale. After making 143 appearances, scoring 16 goals in that period – a 1 in 9 record explained by the fact that manager [[Steve Coppell]] often used Coleman as a makeshift centre forward. Palace finished 10th in Coleman's first season at [[Selhurst Park]], but they were relegated from the new [[FA Premier League]] in his second season (although they did reach the semi-finals of the League Cup). They won promotion as Division One champions at the first attempt, but went straight back down again despite reaching the semi-finals of both cups that season. Coleman was sold to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], the defending league champions, for £2.8 million in December 1995. While at Palace, he was capped for Wales at senior level for the first time.

In 2005, Palace supporters voted Coleman into their [[Crystal Palace F.C.#Crystal Palace "Centenary XI"|Centenary XI]].

====Blackburn Rovers====
Coleman joined [[Premier League]] champions [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for a fee of £2.8&nbsp;million. Blackburn did not retain the Premier League title they had won in [[1994–95 Premier League|1995]], and finished seventh, just missing out on a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] place. Coleman made 28 league appearances over his season-and-a-half at the club, and when he found himself out of the starting line-up too often (not helped by a persistent [[Achilles' tendon|Achilles]] injury), he took the gamble to further his career by dropping two divisions to join [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].

====Fulham====
Fulham, at the time in the [[Football League Second Division|third tier]], were financed by wealthy businessman [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]], and were able to spend a record transfer fee for the division and club, of £2.1&nbsp;million for Coleman in late 1997.<ref>{{cite news|title=Coleman's face fits Keegan's bill|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jan/21/newsstory.sport4|access-date=18 November 2017|work=The Guardian|date=21 January 1999}}</ref> He quickly became club [[captain (association football)|captain]], and led Fulham to promotion under manager [[Kevin Keegan]] in [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].

He remained captain and a regular in the team under new manager [[Jean Tigana]] in the [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01 season]] as Fulham made a successful start to the campaign. However, Coleman's career was effectively ended midway through the season, after he broke his leg in a car crash near [[Bletchingley]] in Surrey on 2 January 2001, just days before an [[FA Cup]] tie against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Harding|first1=Thomas|title=Fulham captain Coleman shatters leg in car crash|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1313073/Fulham-captain-Coleman-shatters-leg-in-car-crash.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1313073/Fulham-captain-Coleman-shatters-leg-in-car-crash.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|access-date=18 November 2017|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 January 2001}}{{cbignore}}</ref> He never recovered from this injury despite playing a reserve fixture in March 2002, a game that only served as an indication that he would never again play at the highest level of English football. He announced his retirement as a player in October 2002, but stayed at the [[West London (sub region)|West London]] club as a member of the coaching staff.<ref>{{cite news|title=Coleman retires after losing injury battle|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/coleman-retires-after-losing-injury-1975491|access-date=18 November 2017|publisher=Wales Online|date=3 October 2002}}</ref>

Coleman was also eligible to play for Ireland, through his father.<ref name="auto"/>

==Managerial career==
===Fulham===
Coleman joined Fulham's coaching staff in October 2002 under Tigana.<ref>{{cite news|title=Coleman retires|url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2002/october/02/coleman-retires|publisher=Fulham F.C|date=2 October 2002|access-date=10 April 2014}}</ref> He later succeeded the Frenchman as caretaker manager in April 2003, and steered Fulham away from relegation danger. He was named as Fulham's permanent manager in May 2003, beating the more experienced [[Klaus Toppmöller]] and [[George Burley]] to the post, and also became the youngest manager in the Premier League.<ref>{{cite news | title = Coleman named Fulham boss | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/3028375.stm | work = BBC Sport | date = 15 May 2003 | access-date =19 December 2007}}</ref>

His first full season in charge saw Fulham finish a surprise ninth place, as many pundits tipped them to struggle and for Coleman to be sacked.<ref>{{cite news | title = Coleman gets new deal | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/3873931.stm | work = BBC Sport | date = 7 July 2004 | access-date =19 December 2007}}</ref> Many of Fulham's key players, such as [[Edwin van der Sar]], [[Louis Saha]], [[Steed Malbranque]] and [[Luís Boa Morte]], were sold in the following years and Fulham did not repeat their earlier successes under Coleman though he kept them clear of relegation. He was sacked on 10 April 2007 in a move that caught some observers by surprise, after a seven-game winless run that left the club four points above the relegation zone.<ref name="Coleman out as Sanchez takes over">{{cite news | title = Coleman out as Sanchez takes over | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/6543541.stm | work = BBC Sport | date = 10 April 2007 | access-date =26 January 2016}}</ref>

Coleman moved abroad to manage recently relegated [[Segunda División]] side [[Real Sociedad]] on 4 July 2007, after being recommended to the club by fellow Welshman and former Real Sociedad manager [[John Toshack]].<ref name="Coleman appointed Sociedad boss">{{cite news | title = Coleman appointed Sociedad boss | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6247584.stm | work = BBC Sport | date = 4 July 2007 | access-date =26 January 2016}}</ref> He was linked with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in October 2007<ref>{{cite news | title = Bolton Wanderers eye Chris Coleman | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/10/19/sfnbol119.xml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071019232007/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fsport%2F2007%2F10%2F19%2Fsfnbol119.xml | url-status = dead | archive-date = 19 October 2007 | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | date = 19 October 2007 | access-date = 19 December 2007 | location = London | first = Mark | last = Ogden }}</ref> though nothing came of it.

===Coventry City===
Coleman was appointed manager of [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] on 19 February 2008, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract. He replaced [[Iain Dowie]], who had been sacked by new owner [[Ray Ranson]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Coleman unveiled as Coventry boss | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/7250422.stm | work = BBC Sport | date = 19 February 2008 | access-date =19 February 2008}}</ref>
