'''Gary McAllister''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born 25 December 1964) is a Scottish professional [[association football|football]] coach and former [[Association football|player]].

McAllister played primarily as a [[midfielder]] in a career spanning over nineteen years. He started his career at local side [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] before moving south of the border to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] at the age of 20. He then went on to play for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], where he won the [[list of English football champions|English league championship]] in [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92]]. McAllister later had spells at [[Premier League]] sides [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], where he was credited with his role in helping the club avoid relegation repeatedly, and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], where he won a cup treble in [[2000–01 Liverpool F.C. season|2000–01]] at the age of 36.

McAllister also represented his [[Scotland national football team|national side]] for nine years, winning 57 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] and scoring five goals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingheroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_international.asp?HeroID=2488 |title=Gary McAllister |access-date=4 April 2008 |publisher=Sporting Heroes}}</ref> His leadership qualities were noticed, and he spent four years as Scotland captain in addition to two seasons as Leeds United captain. He was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in the [[2001 New Year Honours]] in recognition of his contribution to football<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/in_depth/2001/new_year_honours/1734587.stm|title=McAllister claims sixth medal|date=31 December 2001 |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=20 May 2010}}</ref> and was inducted to the [[Scottish Football Hall of Fame]] in 2016.

He was appointed [[player-manager]] of Coventry City in April 2002.<ref name=Coventry>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/1934302.stm |title=Coventry turn to McAllister |access-date=4 April 2008 |date=24 April 2002 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> He [[resign]]ed from this position in January 2004 and did not enter management again until he returned to [[Elland Road]] in January 2008, to replace [[Dennis Wise]] as [[Manager (football)|manager]].<ref name=LUFCmanager>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/7215732.stm |title=Leeds name McAllister as new boss |access-date=4 April 2008 |date=29 January 2008 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> McAllister guided Leeds to the promotion playoffs, but was dismissed in December 2008. In April 2011, while working as assistant to manager [[Gérard Houllier]] at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], he became [[caretaker manager]] at the Premier League club for a few months due to Houllier's ill health. He also had coaching roles at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and Liverpool, returning to Scotland with Rangers in 2018. He joined Steven Gerrard in leaving Rangers making a return to Aston Villa as Assistant Manager again.

==Club career==
===Motherwell===
McAllister began his playing career at his local side [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]]; he stated he supported the club as a child, but also had an affection for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as his family were acquainted with that of [[Matt Busby]].<ref name=":0" /> His senior debut was away to [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] on 1 May 1982. McAllister scored eight [[Goal (sport)|goals]] in 70 appearances, culminating in a fine performance in the 1985 [[Scottish Cup]] semi-final against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].<ref name="mwell">{{cite web|title=Club history - 1984-1994|url=http://www.motherwellfc.co.uk/the-club/history/club-history/1984-1994/|website=Motherwell FC|access-date=27 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504025932/http://www.motherwellfc.co.uk/the-club/history/club-history/1984-1994|archive-date=4 May 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> With Motherwell he was more often a striker than a midfielder.

===Leicester City===
McAllister's performances in the cup caught the eye of [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] manager [[Gordon Milne]]. He signed for the English club, along with Motherwell teammate [[Ally Mauchlen]], for a combined fee of £350,000 in August 1985.<ref name="mwell" /> Although Mauchlen's greater experience cast McAllister as the 'make-weight' in the deal, he soon rose to prominence as an attacking force in Leicester midfield, impressing manager and fans alike with his accurate passing to feet, and confident range of skills on the ball. During his first season at Filbert Street he adapted well to regular First Division football, and began to rise to prominence in creating chances for a team that included [[Steve Lynex]] and [[Alan Smith (footballer, born 1962)|Alan Smith]].<ref name=":0" />

During Leicester's ultimately unsuccessful campaign to stave off relegation to [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] that season under Milne's successor [[Bryan Hamilton]], McAllister found himself employed in a variety of midfield and forward roles, which affected his form. After Hamilton was replaced by [[David Pleat]], however, his stylish playmaking abilities began to flourish.

Over the following three seasons his reputation quickly grew into being one of the best players in the Second Division, boosted by a respectable goal tally from midfield that included an uncommon number of well-executed strikes from unfavourable positions. He was named in the Second Division [[PFA Team of the Year]] in both [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]] and [[1989–90 in English football|1989–90]] and was the subject of constant transfer speculation and interest by several [[Football League First Division|First Division]] sides throughout the following term. He turned down a heavily mooted £1.15 million move to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] to see out his contract with Leicester after [[Brian Clough]] apparently failed to impress him during an interview.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="OFAF">{{Cite book|author=Dave Smith & Paul Taylor|title=Of Fossils and Foxes|year=2010|publisher=Pitch Publishing (Brighton) Limited |isbn=978-1-905411-94-8}}</ref>

In five seasons with Leicester, McAllister played 225 games in total, scoring 52 goals.

===Leeds United===
McAllister arrived at Leeds United on 2 July 1990 for a tribunal-determined fee of £1,000,000, and replaced the role vacated by [[Vinnie Jones]] when he left for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].<ref name=LFCprofile>{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/past_players/players/mcallister/ |title=Past Player Profile – Gary McAllister |access-date=4 April 2008 |work=LiverpoolFC.tv |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328021037/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/past_players/players/mcallister/ |archive-date=28 March 2008}}</ref> The club had just achieved promotion to [[Football League First Division|Division One]], the top tier of [[Football in England|English football]] at the time. In McAllister's [[1990–91 in English football|first season]] at Elland Road, Leeds finished fourth in the table and reached the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] semi-finals. He formed a [[midfield]] quartet that season with fellow Scottish international [[Gordon Strachan]] and relative youngsters [[David Batty]] and [[Gary Speed]]. In the [[1991–92 Leeds United A.F.C. season|1991–92 season]] Leeds United were crowned [[English football champions|League Champions]].

In the rest of McAllister's time at Leeds, the highest the club finished was fifth in the [[1993–94 FA Premier League|1993–94]] and [[1994–95 FA Premier League|1994–95]] seasons. The lowest was 17th in the [[1992–93 FA Premier League|1992–93 Premier League]] – one of the lowest-placed finishes of a defending league champion in English football history. He captained the side for two seasons. During the [[1992–93 Leeds United A.F.C. season|1992–93 season]], McAllister made his debut in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. He scored in matches against [[VfB Stuttgart]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/match/6737--leeds-vs-stuttgart/|title=Leeds 4–1 Stuttgart|access-date=17 April 2014|work=UEFA}}</ref> and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/match/6823--rangers-vs-leeds/|title=Rangers 2–1 Leeds|access-date=17 April 2014|work=UEFA}}</ref> but Leeds were knocked out by the latter in a match hyped as the ''Battle of Britain''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/3208546.stm|title=Battles of Britain|date=20 October 2003|access-date=17 April 2014|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> In McAllister's [[1995–96 Leeds United A.F.C. season|final season]] Leeds finished 13th. He captained the team at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in the [[1996 Football League Cup Final|1996 League Cup Final]], where they were beaten 3–0 by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].

In his six seasons with Leeds United, McAllister played 294 games in total, scoring 45 goals.

===Coventry City===
Aged 31, McAllister left Leeds for Coventry City on 26 July 1996, for a fee of £3million. His move to the Midlands club came less than a year after he had scored a hat-trick against them for Leeds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leedsunited-mad.co.uk/feat/edy3/hattrick_heroes_286630/index.shtml|title=Hat-Trick Heroes|first=Digital Sports Group|last=LTD|website=LeedsUtdMAD}}</ref> He stayed there for four seasons and played firstly under [[Ron Atkinson]] and then former Leeds teammate [[Gordon Strachan]].<ref name=":0" /> The side including [[Noel Whelan (footballer)|Noel Whelan]], [[John Salako]] and [[Darren Huckerby]] were in a relegation battle. Atkinson went upstairs to become 'Director of Football' in late 1996 in order to make way for Strachan. Strachan's team continued to struggle until a late season recovery. With McAllister captaining the side, the Sky Blues secured an away draw against Arsenal and wins against Chelsea, Liverpool (away) and Tottenham Hotspur (away) to secure salvation.<ref name=":0" />

In Strachan's first full season as manager in 1997–98, McAllister played alongside [[George Boateng]] in midfield behind [[Darren Huckerby]] and [[Dion Dublin]] in attack finishing 11th and reaching the FA Cup quarter-finals in 1998. His final Coventry season they had a poor start including defeat by [[Tranmere Rovers]] in the League Cup and finished 15th in the league. The line-up included the likes of [[Robbie Keane]], [[Mustapha Hadji]], [[Carlton Palmer]], [[Mo Konjić]] and [[Youssef Chippo]].

During his initial time at the ''Sky Blues'' he played 140 games and scored 26 goals.

===Liverpool===
Aged 35, on 1 July 2000, McAllister moved to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in a [[Bosman ruling|Bosman transfer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/763889.stm |title=McAllister confirms Reds move |access-date=7 April 2008 |date=25 May 2000 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> Though serving for a relatively short time at [[Anfield]], he played an integral role in the team that won a [[Treble (association football)|treble]] of cups in the [[2000–01 Liverpool F.C. season|2000–01 season]]. [[Gerard Houllier]] described McAllister as his "most inspirational signing".<ref name=LFCprofile/>

He scored a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] winner against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the [[2000–01 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] semi-final<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/uefa_cup/1331304.stm |title=Liverpool's Uefa Cup run |access-date=7 April 2008 |date=15 May 2001 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> and a 44-[[yard]] free-kick that won the [[Merseyside derby]] against local rivals [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the fourth minute of stoppage time.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/1278720.stm |title=Reds leave it late for derby win |access-date=7 April 2008 |date=16 April 2001 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> He scored in the run-in against Coventry City<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/1298566.stm |title=Liverpool dent Coventry's hopes |access-date=7 April 2008 |date=28 April 2001 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> and [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/1301885.stm |title=Bradford slip to hungry Liverpool |access-date=7 April 2008 |date=1 May 2001 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> helping Liverpool to qualify for the [[2001–02 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].

Liverpool's first trophy of the season came in the [[2001 Football League Cup Final|Football League Cup Final]]. After replacing [[Steven Gerrard]] as a 78th minute [[Substitute (football)|substitute]], McAllister scored the team's opening penalty kick in a 5–4 [[Penalty shootout|shootout]] win over [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. He again came on as a substitute in the [[2001 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]], as Liverpool came from behind to win 2–1 against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/1324699.stm |title=Owen shatters Arsenal in Cup final |access-date=7 April 2008 |date=12 May 2001 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> Four days later, he was named in the starting line-up in the [[2001 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final]] against [[Deportivo Alavés|Alavés]]. McAllister scored one, and had a hand in three, of the five Liverpool goals in a memorable 5–4 victory. In the 117th minute, McAllister's free-kick was deflected by Alaves' [[Delfi Geli]] into his own net for the winning [[golden goal]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name = "alaves">{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/uefa_cup/1335119.stm |title=Alaves proud in defeat |access-date=7 April 2008 |date=16 May 2001 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> He was awarded the [[man of the match]] award for his efforts, with [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] pundit and former Liverpool defender [[Alan Hansen]] stating, "Gary McAllister was outstanding.

==International career==
After scoring the equaliser on his debut for [[Scotland B national football team|Scotland B]] against France in April 1987,<ref name=fsscotb/> McAllister debuted for Scotland in a friendly against [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]] in the buildup to the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=stats>[http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/scotland/gary-mcallister-6705/scottish-caps-part-2-1995-99_a11868/ Gary McAllister: Scotland], Sporting Heroes</ref> Though he was included in the squad for the tournament, he did not make an appearance as Scotland were eliminated in the first round.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=stats/>

In October 1990, McAllister scored his first goal for Scotland in a [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying|UEFA Euro 1992 qualifier]] against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]].

Scotland failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] but did qualify for [[UEFA Euro 1996]] in England, with McAllister the [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of the team. Scotland's second match of the group stage was against [[England national football team|England]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. In the second half Scotland, trailing 0–1 to an [[Alan Shearer]] goal, were awarded a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]].

On 31 March 1999, McAllister returned to the Scotland team, captaining the side in a [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualification]] game against [[Czech Republic national football team|the Czech Republic]]. McAllister was booed by a section of [[Celtic Park]] crowd and announced his retirement from international football soon after.<ref name=bow/> Despite later attempts by manager [[Craig Brown (footballer, born 1940)|Craig Brown]] to convince McAllister to return, the [[playmaker]] did not add to his 57 caps.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/3011325/International-Football-McAllister-turned-me-down-admits-Brown.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/3011325/International-Football-McAllister-turned-me-down-admits-Brown.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=International Football: McAllister turned me down, admits Brown|date=23 August 2001 | location=London|work=Daily Telegraph|first=Roddy|last=Forsyth}}{{cbignore}}</ref>
