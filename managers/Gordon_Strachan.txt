'''Gordon David Strachan''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|OBE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|r|æ|x|ə|n}} born 9 February 1957) is a Scottish former [[association football|football]] coach and player who is currently Technical Director of [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]]. He played for [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]], [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], as well as the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]]. He has since managed Coventry City, [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and Scotland.

In club football, Strachan played 635 league games, scoring a total of 138 goals, playing 21 of 25 career seasons in either the English or Scottish top-flight. In international football Strachan earned 50 caps, scoring five goals and played in two [[FIFA World Cup]] final tournaments, [[1982 FIFA World Cup|Spain 82]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|Mexico 86]]. Strachan retired from playing in 1997 at age 40, setting a [[Premier League]] record for an outfield player.

A [[Midfielder#Wide midfielder|right-sided midfielder]], Strachan made his senior debut in 1974 with Dundee before moving on within Scotland, to spend seven seasons at Aberdeen. He first played for the Scotland national team in 1980. While at Aberdeen Strachan won multiple domestic league and cup honours in the early 1980s, as well as the [[1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup]] and [[1983 European Super Cup]]. Moving to England, Strachan won the [[1985 FA Cup final]] in five seasons with Manchester United. He spent the next seven seasons as club captain at Leeds, winning the 1989–90 Second Division and 1991–92 First Division league titles. He played his last game for Scotland in 1992. He moved to Coventry in 1995 for a final three seasons, as a [[player-coach]].

Strachan became full-time manager of Coventry when the incumbent [[Ron Atkinson]] was appointed as [[director of football]]. After five years as Coventry manager, he was sacked in 2001 after the club was relegated from the top-flight for the first time in 34 years. He returned to the Premier League as Southampton manager and guided the "Saints" to the [[2003 FA Cup final]], where they lost 1–0 to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Strachan resigned from Southampton in 2004 and took a 16-month break from management. He returned to Scotland to become manager of Celtic, where he achieved three successive league titles and other domestic cup wins. Strachan left Celtic in May 2009 after failing to win a fourth title. He then became manager of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the English [[EFL Championship|Championship]], but left the club after an unsuccessful 12 months in the job. Strachan then managed the Scotland national team for five years, but was unable to secure qualification for a major tournament.

Strachan was named as [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] for the [[1990–91 in English football|1990–91 season]] while at Leeds. He was also named Manager of the Year in Scotland several times by writers and players while at Celtic. In 2007, Strachan was inducted into the [[Scottish Football Hall of Fame]]. He is the father of [[Craig Strachan (footballer)|Craig Strachan]] and [[Gavin Strachan]] and the grandfather of [[Luke Strachan]], all of whom were also footballers.

Strachan was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[1993 New Year Honours]] for services to association football.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=53153 |date=30 December 1992 |page=12 |supp=y }}</ref>

==Club career==
Born and raised in [[Muirhouse]], [[Edinburgh]], Strachan supported [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] as a boy.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=7}}</ref><ref name="dee">{{cite web|title=Dark blue to dark blue|url=http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news/dark-blue-to-dark-blue|publisher=Dundee FC|access-date=2 March 2015|date=18 December 2013|archive-date=28 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928010217/http://dundeefc.co.uk/news/dark-blue-to-dark-blue/|url-status=live}}</ref> His father, Jim, worked as a scaffolder, and his mother, Catherine, worked at a whisky distillery.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=8}}</ref> At age 15, he damaged his vision playing football on the school playground when a pen in his pocket became lodged in his right eye; the pen came within "a thousandth of an inch" of permanently costing him the vision in his eye.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=6}}</ref> He was offered a contract by Hibernian manager [[Eddie Turnbull]], but his father decided against the offer after stating the club did not pay sufficient expenses for footwear.<ref name="page 18"/>

===Dundee===
Strachan began his career with [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]], having decided to sign with the Scottish club at age 14.<ref name="page 18">{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=17}}</ref> In joining the club, he rejected an approach from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]],<ref name="dee" /> reasoning he had a better chance to establish himself in the first team at [[Dens Park]].<ref name="page 18"/> His natural talent was immediately apparent, and he quickly earned a reputation as an outstanding player in the second team, twice winning the Scottish Reserve Player of the Year Award.<ref name="dee" /> He made his mark as an 18-year-old when he outplayed [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] in a friendly with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in August 1975;<ref name="dee" /> ''[[The Sunday Post]]'' compared him to a young [[Billy Bremner]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=25}}</ref> Strachan became a regular player in the [[1975–76 Scottish Premier Division|1975–76]] season, the inaugural season of the [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Scottish Premier Division]], featuring in 17 of the club's 36 league matches;<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=26}}</ref> however, [[David White (Scottish footballer)|David White]]'s "Dee" were relegated on the last day of the season after [[Dundee derby|rivals]] [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] edged ahead on goal average with an unlikely draw with champions [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=27}}</ref>

New boss [[Tommy Gemmell]] handed 19-year-old Strachan the captaincy for the [[1976–77 Scottish First Division|1976–77]] [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] campaign,<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=28}}</ref> and he remains the youngest player to have captained Dundee.<ref name="dee" /> Strachan considers his performance as captain as very poor. "I was a pathetic Billy Bremner. I wanted to go about bumping into people, growling at people, shouting at people. And I forgot to be a footballer."<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfevpE4nSRA |title=Football's Greatest: Gordon Strachan - Fergie's petrol was anger |language=en |minutes=6:08 |access-date=2024-05-01 |via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> The club failed to shine in the lower divisions, and Strachan lost his first-team place early in the [[1977–78 Scottish First Division|1977–78 season]] following a drinking session with [[Jimmy Johnstone]]; Gemmell was also concerned that Strachan was "getting kicked a lot" after opposition teams worked out that the way to stop Dundee was to take out their playmaker.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=31}}</ref> Strachan decided to leave Dundee as the club seemed unlikely to win back their top-flight status; the Dundee chairman was also keen on cashing in his most prized asset, and told Gemmell that "we need £50,000 by Friday or the banks are closing the gate".<ref name="dee" /><ref name="page 33">{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=33}}</ref> His last match for Dundee was on 26 October 1977 in a 6–0 defeat in the League Cup to [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] at [[Palmerston Park]], which Strachan described in his autobiography as "embarrassing".

===Aberdeen===
Strachan was signed by [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] manager [[Billy McNeill]] in November 1977 for a fee of £50,000 plus [[Jim Shirra]].<ref name="page 33"/> Poor form and niggling injuries made [[1977–78 Aberdeen F.C. season|1977–78]] a poor season for Strachan, though the "Dons" went on to finish second in the Scottish Premier Division. He was not picked for the [[1978 Scottish Cup Final]] defeat to Rangers.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=41}}</ref> Strachan did win the Scottish 2nd XI Cup with the reserves in 1978.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://afcheritage.org/matches/match-report?id=6812 | title = Rangers 0 - 0 Aberdeen: Scottish Second XI Cup Final Second Leg | website = AFC Heritage | access-date = 30 May 2023 | archive-date = 28 November 2023 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20231128190619/https://afcheritage.org/matches/match-report?id=6812 | url-status = live }}</ref>

McNeill left the [[Pittodrie Stadium]] for [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in summer 1978, and [[Alex Ferguson]] was appointed as the new manager.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=44}}</ref> Strachan played at [[Hampden Park]] in the [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (March)|1979]] [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] defeat to Rangers, and set up [[Duncan Davidson (footballer)|Duncan Davidson]] for the game's opening goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=47}}</ref> Though the [[1978–79 Aberdeen F.C. season|1978–79 campaign]] was a disappointment, Aberdeen went on to win the league title in [[1979–80 Aberdeen F.C. season|1979–80]] after closing a ten-point deficit over Celtic with a late run that included two victories at [[Celtic Park]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=52}}</ref> They again reached the [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (December)|League Cup Final]], beating both [[Old Firm]] sides ''en route'', where they lost 3–0 to Dundee United at Dens Park.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=48}}</ref> At the end of the season, Strachan was elected [[SFWA Footballer of the Year]].<ref name="dee" /><ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=56}}</ref> After gaining assurance [[Alex McLeish]] would also stay with the club, Strachan signed a new contract to keep him at Pittodrie until 1984.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=57}}</ref>
[[File:Gordon Strachan's 1983 ECWC final shirt.jpg|alt=a red Aberdeen football shirt in a display cabinet|thumb|Gordon Strachan's 1983 European Cup Winner's Cup final shirt on display at Spartan FC's HQ at Pilton Edinburgh]]
The "Reds" could only manage a second-place finish in [[1980–81 Aberdeen F.C. season|1980–81]], as Celtic regained the league title. They exited the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in the second round with defeat to eventual champions [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]; manager [[Bob Paisley]] said Strachan would become "Britain's first £2&nbsp;million player", in what was a (successful) early attempt at [[mind games]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=58}}</ref> He missed the second half of the season with a muscle tear in his stomach.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=59}}</ref> With fit-again Strachan on the right flank – supported by full-back [[Stuart Kennedy]] – and record signing [[Peter Weir (footballer)|Peter Weir]] on the left-flank, Aberdeen mounted a genuine title challenge in [[1981–82 Aberdeen F.C. season|1981–82]], but had to settle for second place to Celtic.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=61}}</ref> They did though lift the [[Scottish Cup]] with a [[1982 Scottish Cup Final|4–1 extra-time victory]] over Rangers, with Strachan contributing one assist and one goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=63}}</ref>

The [[1982–83 Aberdeen F.C. season|1982–83 campaign]] was the greatest in the [[History of Aberdeen F.C.|history of the club]], and Strachan made his mark early on with four goals in a 5–1 victory at former club Dundee in the League Cup.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=65}}</ref> Despite only finishing third in the league (albeit only one point behind champions and [[New Firm (Scotland)|New Firm]] rivals Dundee United) and exiting the League Cup in the quarter-finals, Aberdeen won the Scottish Cup and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]]. The club's European success came with a [[1983 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|2–1 after-extra-time victory]] over Spanish giants [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] at [[Ullevi]] in [[Gothenburg]]. The Scottish Cup came with a [[1983 Scottish Cup Final|1–0 win]] over Rangers.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=67}}</ref> The "Dons" continued their success by delivering the league title and Scottish Cup in [[1983–84 Aberdeen F.C. season|1983–84]], with Strachan setting up [[Mark McGhee]] for the winning goal in the [[1984 Scottish Cup Final|cup final]] win over Celtic.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=70}}</ref> This completed a unique treble, as they defeated [[Hamburger SV]] in the [[1983 European Super Cup]].

===Manchester United===
In August 1984, Manchester United spent £500,000 to take Strachan to [[Old Trafford]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=99}}</ref> However, because Strachan had previously signed a pre-contract agreement with [[Bundesliga]] side [[1. FC Köln]], United paid £75,000 compensation to resolve the row – teammate [[Mark McGhee]] had also signed a contract with [[Hamburger SV]] on the understanding that Strachan would also be playing in Germany.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=100}}</ref> Strachan opened the [[1984–85 Manchester United F.C. season|1984–85 campaign]] with four goals in seven matches,<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=104}}</ref> though the "Red Devils" could only manage a fourth-place finish in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. He featured at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in the [[1985 FA Cup Final]], as United ran out 1–0 winners over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]; his lung-bursting run off-the-ball helped [[Norman Whiteside]] to find the space for his extra-time winner.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=109}}</ref>

After winning their opening ten league matches of the [[1985–86 Manchester United F.C. season|1985–86 season]], United had to cope without Strachan, who was sidelined for much of the season with injury.<ref name="page 112">{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=112}}</ref> They proved unable to cope with their injuries – another key player facing extended time in the treatment room was [[Bryan Robson]] – and limped to another fourth-place finish.<ref name="page 112"/> Atkinson was replaced by [[Alex Ferguson]] in November 1986, and Strachan mocked sobbing as he told his teammates, "I never thought he'd follow me this far south!"<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=124}}</ref> After his arrival, Ferguson speculated that no longer being the star player had negatively affected Strachan's form.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=125}}</ref> United finished a disappointing 11th in [[1986–87 Manchester United F.C. season|1986–87]], before rising to second place in [[1987–88 Manchester United F.C. season|1987–88]]. Strachan's form was again patchy in [[1988–89 Manchester United F.C. season|1988–89]], as United slipped back down to 11th.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=127}}</ref>

===Leeds United===
In March 1989, [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] manager [[Ron Atkinson]] had a bid of £200,000 accepted by Manchester United, and he offered Strachan a contract paying more money than anyone in the club's history.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=163}}</ref> However likely a move to Sheffield seemed, [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] manager [[Howard Wilkinson]] matched the offer and convinced Strachan to drop down into the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=165}}</ref> He quickly became a popular figure at [[Elland Road]], earning comparisons to former favourites [[Bobby Collins (footballer)|Bobby Collins]] and [[Johnny Giles]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=167}}</ref> Signing a two-year contract, he was awarded with the captain's armband.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=168}}</ref> He formed an unlikely midfield partnership with [[Vinnie Jones]] and led the club to the Second Division title in [[1989–90 Football League|1989–90]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=169}}</ref>

With the "Whites" now in the First Division, Wilkinson secured a midfield quartet of Strachan, [[Gary McAllister]], [[David Batty]] and [[Gary Speed]].<ref name="page 177">{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=177}}</ref> They achieved a commendable fourth-place finish in [[1990–91 Football League|1990–91]], and also reached the semi-finals of the [[1990–91 Football League Cup|League Cup]].<ref name="page 177"/> Strachan was voted [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] for his performances during the campaign, becoming the first player to win the award both in Scotland and in England.<ref name="page 177"/>

Strachan signed a new two-year contract, before captaining Leeds to the league title in [[1991–92 Leeds United A.F.C. season|1991–92]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=180}}</ref> In so doing, he denied former boss Alex Ferguson and Leeds' [[Leeds United F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry|hated rivals]] Manchester United the title.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=181}}</ref> However, Strachan (now nearing age 35) was beginning to feel the effects of his [[sciatica]] and missed a number of matches due to his bad back.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=182}}</ref> Following the club's success, Strachan was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for his services to sport.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=197}}</ref>

However, Leeds were unable to build on their success, and finished the [[1992–93 Leeds United A.F.C. season|1992–93 season]] down in 17th place in what was newly re-branded as the [[Premier League]].<ref name="page 202">{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=202}}</ref> Strachan continued to impress though, and was given the club's Player of the Year award.<ref name="page 202"/> He scored a hat-trick against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 10 April 1993.<ref>{{cite news |last=Edworthy |first=Niall |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-strachan-inspires-1454576.html |title=Strachan inspires |date=11 April 1993 |access-date=15 September 2014 |work=The Independent |location=London |archive-date=3 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103154957/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-strachan-inspires-1454576.html |url-status=live }}</ref> This was his second hat-trick for Leeds, the first having come in September 1989 when he found the net three times in a 4–0 win over promotion rivals [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in the Second Division at [[Elland Road]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leedsunited-mad.co.uk/feat/edy3/hattrick_heroes_286630/index.shtml|title=Hat-Trick Heroes|access-date=12 March 2018|archive-date=3 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803005112/http://www.leedsunited-mad.co.uk/feat/edy3/hattrick_heroes_286630/index.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref>

Strachan managed 37 starts in [[1993–94 Leeds United A.F.C. season|1993–94]], and Leeds rose to fifth.<ref name="page 202"/> He was rarely selected in the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95 season]], which would prove to be the end of his spell at Elland Road, where he had spent six years.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=204}}</ref>

===Coventry City===
In March 1995, Strachan moved to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] to work as assistant manager under new manager Ron Atkinson, the man who had brought him south of the border to Manchester United 11 years earlier. It was also agreed he would replace Atkinson as manager in summer 1997.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=206}}</ref> Strachan coached the team and led training sessions while learning the finer points of management from Atkinson.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=208}}</ref> He also took to the field at [[Highfield Road]], playing 26 Premier League matches for the Sky Blues over the next two years before finally hanging up his boots in his 40th year. Atkinson signed Aberdeen midfielder [[Eoin Jess]] in 1996 purely on the basis of Strachan's recommendation.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=211}}</ref> However, [[Isaías Marques Soares|Isaías]] left the club after falling-out with Strachan.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=212}}</ref> Coventry signed [[Gary McAllister]] for £3&nbsp;million on wages of £20,000 per week; the deal was done by McAllister's former teammate and friend Strachan, while Atkinson was largely opposed to the deal.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=214}}</ref> The club struggled at the start of the [[1996–97 Coventry City F.C. season|1996–97 campaign]], and the club's board of directors asked Atkinson to step aside in November 1996, some months earlier than first agreed, and Strachan was appointed manager.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=215}}</ref>

==International career==
Strachan won his first cap for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] on 16 May 1980, in a [[British Home Championship]] defeat to [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] at [[Windsor Park]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=134}}</ref> Strachan helped Scotland qualify for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] and scored a crucial goal in [[1982 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying]] by scoring the only goal against [[Sweden men's national football team|Sweden]] at the [[Råsunda Stadium]] in Stockholm.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=135}}</ref> He did not feature in the [[1982 British Home Championship]], as [[Jock Stein]] wanted to rest him for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], held in Spain.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=136}}</ref> The Scots cruised to a 5–2 victory over [[New Zealand men's national football team|New Zealand]] at [[La Rosaleda Stadium]], [[Málaga]]; Strachan was named Man of the Match.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=137}}</ref> Scotland then lost 4–1 to a world-class [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] side at the [[Estadio Benito Villamarín]], [[Seville]].<ref name="page 138">{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=138}}</ref> In the third match, a 2–2 draw with the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] back in Málaga saw Scotland exit the tournament on goal difference.<ref name="page 138"/>

Strachan fell out of the first team picture under [[Andy Roxburgh]], and was omitted from the [[1990 FIFA World Cup squads|squad]] for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=148}}</ref> Nevertheless, he enjoyed a national team revival between 1990 and 1992, and captained his country in [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 2|qualification]] for [[UEFA Euro 1992]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=149}}</ref> However, he did not travel to Sweden as a member of the squad, as he announced his retirement due to long-term back troubles.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=150}}</ref> He won 50 full caps, and scored five international goals.

==Managerial career==
===Coventry City===
When Ron Atkinson became Coventry City's director of football in November 1996, Strachan was promoted to a player manager position. He appointed [[Alex Miller]] as his assistant.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=217}}</ref> After an upturn in results, Strachan was named [[Premier League Manager of the Month|Manager of the Month]] in December.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=218}}</ref> However, 1 win in 12 matches in the New Year left the "Sky Blues" in the relegation zone. Late wins over Liverpool, [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] saved their season though, and relegation was avoided by a one-point margin. Strachan played in the win over Chelsea at [[Highfield Road]] at age 40, in what was at the time a record age for an outfield player in the Premier League.{{fact|date=December 2022}}

Strachan signed Swedish goalkeeper [[Magnus Hedman]] and defender [[Roland Nilsson]], Dutch midfielder [[George Boateng]], and Romanian striker [[Viorel Moldovan]] – all of whom would win international caps.<ref name="page 222">{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=222}}</ref> Coventry rose to 11th place in [[1997–98 Coventry City F.C. season|1997–98]], and also reached the quarter-finals of the [[1997–98 FA Cup]].<ref name="page 222"/> After Miller left the club, Strachan replaced him with [[Garry Pendrey]], who would go on to spend many years as his assistant at various clubs.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=223}}</ref> Strachan was again named Manager of the Month in February 1998.{{fact|date=December 2022}}

The club finished 15th in [[1998–99 Coventry City F.C. season|1998–99]] and 14th in [[1999–2000 Coventry City F.C. season|1999–2000]], as Strachan spent £6&nbsp;million on Irish striker [[Robbie Keane]] and £5&nbsp;million on Moroccans [[Mustapha Hadji]] and [[Youssef Chippo]], while selling [[Dion Dublin]] to Midlands rivals [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=227}}</ref> Coventry were relegated at the end of the [[2000–01 Coventry City F.C. season|2000–01 season]], making Strachan unpopular with fans.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/1132152.stm|title=Strachan family put off by abuse|work=BBC Sport|date=23 January 2001|access-date=20 July 2010|archive-date=27 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227225953/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/1132152.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> New signing [[Craig Bellamy]] proved disappointing, while Robbie Keane was sold and Gary McAllister departed for Liverpool.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=228}}</ref> Strachan attempted to launch a promotion campaign by signing striker [[Lee Hughes]], but in the face of increasing supporter unrest, he was sacked five matches into the [[2001–02 Coventry City F.C. season|2001–02]] [[Football League First Division|First Division]] campaign.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/championship/3012391/First-Division-Round-up-Strachan-feels-fans-fury.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120911210246/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/championship/3012391/First-Division-Round-up-Strachan-feels-fans-fury.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 September 2012|title=First Division Round-up: Strachan feels fans' fury|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 September 2001|access-date =20 July 2010|location=London}}</ref> His replacement, Roland Nilsson, took the club to an 11th-place finish.{{fact|date=December 2022}}

===Southampton===
Strachan returned to management within weeks, taking the manager's job at Premier League [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], who had sacked manager [[Stuart Gray (footballer, born 1960)|Stuart Gray]] after a terrible start to their first season at the new [[St Mary's Stadium]]. Most pundits had already written off their survival chances by the time of Strachan's appointment in October 2001, but he turned round their fortunes and they finished 11th in the Premier League. The Saints progressed further in [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03]] when they finished eighth and reached the [[2003 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]], where they lost 1–0 to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. As Arsenal had already qualified for the [[2003–04 UEFA Champions League]], Southampton won a place in the [[2003–04 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=UEFA.com |title=Southampton {{!}} History {{!}} UEFA Europa League |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/history/clubs/52923--southampton/ |access-date=2023-12-24 |website=[[UEFA]] |language=en}}</ref>

In February 2004, Strachan announced his resignation as Southampton manager after his decision not to stay on at the club in the summer was leaked to the press.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=2}}</ref> He wanted to take a break from football, but was forced to resign earlier than initially intended due to the speculation surrounding his and the club's future following the leak.<ref>{{harvnb|Moynihan|2004|p=4}}</ref>

===Celtic===
After a 16-month break, Strachan returned to management on 1 June 2005, when he succeeded [[Martin O'Neill]] as manager of Celtic in the [[Scottish Premier League]] (SPL). For [[2005–06 in Scottish football|2005–06]], his stated aim was to regain the SPL title from rivals Rangers. He had an embarrassing start to his campaign as Celtic manager, losing 5–0 to Slovakian champions [[FC Petržalka 1898|Artmedia Bratislava]] on 27 July 2005 and three days later, drawing 4–4 with [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] in his first SPL match in charge of the [[Glasgow]] club. The loss against Artmedia meant Celtic suffered an early exit from European competition, despite winning the return match 4–0. After this disastrous start, Celtic started to improve under Strachan. A low-point was the shock defeat in the third round of the Scottish Cup to First Division [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]] on 8 January 2006. However, the following month his team made history when they defeated [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] 8–1, a record victory margin for the SPL at the time. Strachan's first season was ultimately successful as he coached Celtic to victory in the League Cup and, on 5 April 2006, his side clinched the SPL title in record time and with six matches remaining. Reflecting this achievement, Strachan was voted Manager of the Year by the [[Scottish Football Writers' Association]] eight days later.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/4906162.stm|title=Strachan is writers' boss of year|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 April 2006|access-date=24 October 2009|archive-date=26 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226060853/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/4906162.stm|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Strachan Gordon.jpg|thumb|Strachan ahead of Celtic's Champions League qualifier against [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]], August 2007]]
The following year, Strachan restructured the team and made a series of signings, bringing in players such as Hibernian's [[Derek Riordan]]; Chelsea's [[Jiří Jarošík]]; [[Kenny Miller]] and [[Lee Naylor (footballer)|Lee Naylor]] from [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]; [[Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink]] from [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]]; [[Thomas Gravesen]] from [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]; and [[Paul Hartley]] and [[Steven Pressley]] from [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]]. Celtic flourished and by mid-January 2007 held a 17-point lead in the SPL table. UEFA Champions League football again returned to Celtic Park, the team having automatically qualified for the group stages and drawn alongside [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] and Manchester United. Home victories against all three Group F members saw the team progress to the round of 16 of the Champions League for the first time since the competition was re-formatted in 1993. Celtic lost their round of 16 tie against eventual winners [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in extra time, missing out on a place in the quarter-finals. On 22 April 2007, Strachan guided Celtic to their 41st league championship, and second in succession. A 2–1 victory against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]]<ref>Colin Moffat, [https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/6574335.stm Kilmarnock 1–2 Celtic] , BBC Sport, 22 April 2007</ref> left Celtic 13 points clear of Rangers with four matches remaining. Later that day, Strachan was recognised as the inaugural [[PFA Scotland Manager of the Year]] for 2007. Celtic went on to win the [[2006–07 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup]], beating Dunfermline Athletic.{{fact|date=December 2022}}

In the [[2007–08 Celtic F.C. season|2007–08 season]], Strachan led Celtic into the round of 16 of the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] again after defeating Milan, Benfica and [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]. By April, there was significant criticism from the press and the fans after a 1–0 loss to Aberdeen in the [[2007–08 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup]] quarter-final and a 1–0 loss to ten-man [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] in the [[2007–08 Scottish Premier League|SPL]]. However, after defeating Rangers twice at home, on 22 May 2008 Strachan became only the third ever Celtic manager to guide the club to three consecutive Scottish league titles.{{fact|date=December 2022}}

In the [[2008–09 Celtic F.C. season|2008–09]] season, after winning the League Cup after extra time against Rangers, but failing to lead Celtic to another league title, he resigned as manager on 25 May 2009.<ref>[http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.2510279.0.Strachan_quits_as_Celtic_manager.php Strachan quits as manager]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'', 25 May 2009</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/8067244.stm|title=Strachan resigns as Celtic boss|date=25 May 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=25 May 2009|archive-date=26 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526012544/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/8067244.stm|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Enmity with Alex Ferguson===
Despite playing for Alex Ferguson at two clubs, the pair had an ongoing public feud during Strachan's managerial career. In his 1999 autobiography, the former Manchester United manager said, "I decided this man could not be trusted an inch – I would not want to expose my back to him in a hurry." In his own 2006 autobiography, in response to Ferguson's comments, Strachan said he was "surprised and disappointed".<ref>{{cite news|title=Fergie v Strachan|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/5335578.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 September 2006|access-date=19 October 2010|first=Simon|last=Austin|archive-date=21 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321204408/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/5335578.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> The rivalry dates from Strachan's time playing under Ferguson, first at Aberdeen and later Manchester United.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shaw|first=Phil|title=Strachan the maverick with a rich streak of pragmatism|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/strachan-the-maverick-with-a-rich-streak-of-pragmatism-745131.html|work=The Independent|access-date=14 July 2010|date=14 May 2003|location=London}}</ref> In August 2006, after his Celtic team was drawn to play Ferguson's Manchester United in the Champions League, Strachan said that there was no longer any enmity between the two managers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Murray|first1=Ewan|title=Strachan denies Ferguson rift|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/aug/26/newsstory.sport7|access-date=12 October 2017|work=The Guardian|date=26 August 2006}}</ref>
