'''Gérard Paul Francis Houllier''' ({{IPA|fr|ʒeʁaʁ ulje}}; 3 September 1947{{spnd}}14 December 2020) was a French professional [[association football|football]] manager and player.<ref name=obit>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/14/gerard-houllier-obituary|title=Gerard Houllier obituary|access-date=14 December 2020 |work=The Guardian |first=Peter |last=Mason |date=14 December 2020}}</ref> Clubs he managed include [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], [[RC Lens|Lens]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], where he won the [[FA Cup]], [[EFL Cup|League Cup]], [[FA Charity Shield]], [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] and [[UEFA Super Cup]] in 2001. He then guided [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] to two French titles, before announcing his resignation on 25 May 2007. He became manager of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in September 2010. He also coached the [[France national football team|France national team]] between 1992 and 1993. He assisted [[Aimé Jacquet]] in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], was part of [[UEFA]]'s and [[FIFA]]'s Technical Committee in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] finals, and technical director for the [[French Football Federation]] during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] finals. In June 2011, he stepped down from club coaching, leaving his managerial role at Aston Villa, following frequent hospitalisation over heart problems.

From July 2012 until his death, Houllier had been head of global football for [[Red Bull GmbH|Red Bull]]. He was responsible for Austrian side [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]], Germany's [[RB Leipzig]] and American club [[New York Red Bulls]], [[Red Bull Brasil]], as well as the now dissolved [[Red Bull Ghana]] academies. He became the technical director of [[Women's association football|women's football]] clubs [[Olympique Lyonnais Féminin|Lyon Féminin]] and [[OL Reign]] in November 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kidd |first1=Robert |title=Interview: The Olympique Lyon-strategy behind the purchase of a US women's team |url=https://offthepitch.com/a/interview-olympique-lyon-strategy-behind-purchase-us-womens-team |access-date=28 November 2020 |publisher=Off the Pitch |date=24 November 2020}}</ref>

==Early life==
Born in [[Thérouanne]], Houllier entered [[Université Lille Nord de France|Lille University]] to pursue a degree in English, but in the first year his father's serious illness forced him to drop out of full-time study and start work, eventually as a school teacher, while he completed his degree part-time. As part of his degree, he elected to spend a year in 1969–1970 in the city of [[Liverpool]] as an assistant at [[Alsop High School|Alsop Comprehensive School]], and while there he attended his first [[Liverpool F.C.]] match on 16 September 1969, a 10–0 thrashing of Irish club [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]]. He also played for an amateur local side, Alsop. He was an enthusiastic footballer, but never threatened the professional ranks as a player. He was deputy headmaster of the École Normale d'Arras until reaching age 26 in 1973, when he began his full-time managerial career as player-manager of Le Touquet.<ref name=Factfile>{{cite news|url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~2147901,00.html|title=Gerard Houllier factfile|publisher=Aston Villa F.

==Managerial career==
===Early career and France national team===
Between 1976 and 1982, Houllier was head coach of French amateur club [[US Nœux-les-Mines|Nœux-les-Mines]].<ref name=Factfile/> Despite limited resources, the team achieved promotion during his tenure, rising to the [[Ligue 2|Division 2]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Richard |title=From the pits to the peaks |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/may/16/uefa.sport3 |access-date=14 December 2020 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 May 2001}}</ref> He then moved to [[RC Lens|Lens]] in 1982, coaching them to promotion to the top division and qualification for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], before moving to [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] in 1985, where PSG won the French title the following year. In 1988, Houllier was appointed technical director and assistant to the [[France national football team|France national team]], under manager [[Michel Platini]]. Houllier became manager in 1992, but resigned in November 1993 after France failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] finals.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/uefa_cup/1319639.stm |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |title=Gerard Houllier profile |date=9 May 2001 |access-date=14 December 2020}}</ref>

In the 2011 book ''Secrets de coachs'', Houllier singled out winger [[David Ginola]] for blame in a crucial defeat to [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] during the qualification campaign. Ginola filed a lawsuit against Houllier for defamation, but this was dismissed by a French court in 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/04/david-ginola-loses-lawsuit-gerard-houllier|title=David Ginola loses lawsuit against former France coach Gérard Houllier|work=The Guardian |date= 4 April 2012|access-date=4 April 2012}}</ref> Houllier remained as technical director for the national team until 1998, a role which included the coaching of France's junior sides. In 1996, Houllier's under-18 side won the [[1996 UEFA European Under-18 Championship|European Under-18 Championship]], and several members of his youth teams, such as [[David Trezeguet]] and [[Thierry Henry]] went on to form part of France's victorious team in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-houllier-the-passionate-enthusiast-1184617.html |work=[[The Independent]] |title=Football: Houllier the passionate enthusiast |first=Richard |last=Williams |access-date=14 December 2020 |date=23 October 2011}}</ref>

===Liverpool===
In July 1998, Houllier was invited to become joint team manager of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], together with [[Roy Evans]]. The arrangement did not work out and Evans resigned in November after losing to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] 3–1 at home in the [[1998–99 Football League Cup|League Cup]] on 10 November 1998. Prior to the defeat, Liverpool were eliminated from the [[1998–99 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] by Spanish side [[RC Celta de Vigo|Celta de Vigo]]. The departure of Evans left Houllier in sole charge of the team.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/11/gerard-houllier-the-man-who-nearly-died-making-liverpool-great-again|title = Gérard Houllier: the man who nearly died making Liverpool great again|date=11 February 2020|work=The Guardian|access-date=11 February 2020}}</ref>	
	
Houllier began what he described as a five-year programme to rebuild the team, and restore discipline to a squad that had been labelled widely as "[[Spice Boys (footballers)|Spice Boys]]", as well as begin a continental approach, both tactically and in terms of personnel, to the game starting in 1999.<ref name="change"/> That summer, [[Paul Ince]], [[David James (footballer, born 1970)|David James]], [[Jason McAteer]], [[Rob Jones (footballer, born 1971)|Rob Jones]], [[Tony Warner]] and [[Steve Harkness]] were all sold, while [[Steve McManaman]] left on a free transfer. Simultaneously, eight new players were signed: [[Sami Hyypiä]], [[Dietmar Hamann]], [[Stéphane Henchoz]], [[Vladimír Šmicer]], [[Sander Westerveld]], [[Titi Camara]], [[Erik Meijer (footballer)|Eric Meijer]] and [[Djimi Traoré]]. The club's youth players such as [[Jamie Carragher]], [[Michael Owen]] and [[Steven Gerrard]] also became a cornerstone of the team. Liverpool's training facilities at [[Melwood]] were thoroughly overhauled.<ref name="change">McNulty, Phil (20 May 2004). "Houllier defiant to the end". BBC Sport. Retrieved 14 December 2020</ref>

The rebuilding continued in 2000 with the signings of [[Markus Babbel]], [[Nicky Barmby]], [[Pegguy Arphexad]], [[Grégory Vignal]], [[Emile Heskey]], [[Gary McAllister]], [[Igor Bišćan]] and [[Christian Ziege]], as well as the departures of [[David Thompson (footballer, born 1977)|David Thompson]], [[Phil Babb]], [[Dominic Matteo]], [[Steve Staunton]], [[Brad Friedel]] and [[Stig Inge Bjørnebye]]. The efforts yielded a result in the successful [[2000–01 Liverpool F.C. season|2000–01 season]], when Liverpool won a [[Treble (association football)|cup treble]] of the [[2000–01 Football League Cup|League Cup]], the [[2000–01 FA Cup|FA Cup]] and the [[2000–01 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] and finished third in the [[2000–01 FA Premier League|Premier League]], hence qualifying for Champions League. In August 2001, Liverpool won the [[2001 FA Charity Shield|Charity Shield]] against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[2001 UEFA Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup]] against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1506424.stm|title=Liverpool sink Bayern|date=24 August 2001|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=28 September 2010|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715044347/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1506424.stm |archive-date=15 July 2009}}</ref>

In October 2001, after falling ill at half-time at Liverpool's [[2001–02 FA Premier League|Premier League]] match with [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], Houllier was rushed to hospital for an emergency operation due to the discovery of a heart condition, an [[aortic dissection]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1600589.stm|title=Houllier's scare explained|date=15 October 2001|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> With the help of caretaker manager [[Phil Thompson]], he guided Liverpool to a second-place finish in the [[2001–02 FA Premier League]] season, at the time their best record in the Premiership. Houllier returned to active management of the club after five months, although significantly weakened by the heart condition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/11/gerard-houllier-the-man-who-nearly-died-making-liverpool-great-again|title=Gérard Houllier: the man who helped to make Liverpool great again|date=11 February 2020|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

In the 2002—03 season, Liverpool finished in the fifth place in the Premier League, failing to qualify for the following season's UEFA Champions League after a final-day defeat to Chelsea.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chelsea in Champions League|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2978103.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=11 May 2003}}</ref> Critics blamed Houllier's unsuccessful summer signings in 2002, namely [[El Hadji Diouf]] (Lens, £10&nbsp;million),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/el-hadji-diouf-worst-liverpool-10049659|title=El Hadji Diouf was worst Liverpool FC player I played with says Steven Gerrard|first=David|last=Prentice|date=14 September 2015|website=North Wales Live}}</ref> [[Salif Diao]] ([[CS Sedan|Sedan]], £5&nbsp;million)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/liverpool-in-5m-diao-deal-6317228.html|title=Liverpool in £5m Diao deal|date=27 May 2002|website=Evening Standard}}</ref> and [[Bruno Cheyrou]] ([[Lille OSC|Lille]], £4&nbsp;million),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/red-sign-bruno-3558296|title=Red sign Bruno|first=Liverpool|last=Echo|date=16 May 2002|website=Liverpool Echo}}</ref> and his failure to make [[Nicolas Anelka]]'s loan move permanent in favour of signing the ineffective Diouf.

===Lyon===
On 29 May 2005, it was announced that Houllier had signed a two-year contract as manager of the champions of [[Ligue 1]], succeeding [[Paul Le Guen]]. [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] had just won their previous fourth successive championship and Houllier was hired to convert this domestic dominance to the European stage. Despite continuing this dominance of Ligue 1, Lyon lost to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in the quarter-finals of the [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League|2005–06 Champions League]] while they crashed out to the inexperienced [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] in the first knockout round of the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|2006–07 Champions League]]. Houllier also suffered a cup final defeat ([[Coupe de la Ligue]]) to [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]. However, in April 2007, Houllier won his second-straight (Lyon's sixth-straight) Ligue 1 title after [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]]'s loss to [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]]. The 2006–07 season proved to be his last with the club: on 25 May 2007, he stepped down due to a fractious relationship with outspoken chairman [[Jean-Michel Aulas]], who was frustrated at the club's inability to convert domestic dominance into European success.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Doyle |first=Paul |date=2007-05-25 |title=Houllier leaves Lyon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/25/newsstory.lyon |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210302145108/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/25/newsstory.lyon |archive-date=2021-03-02 |access-date=2024-04-17 |work=The Guardian |department=Soccer |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=25 May 2007 |title=Gérard Houllier to leave OL |url=https://www.ol.fr/en/news/gerard-houllier-quitte-lol-7144-2 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240417150919/https://www.ol.fr/en/news/gerard-houllier-quitte-lol-7144-2 |archive-date=2024-04-17 |access-date=2024-04-17 |website=Olympique Lyonnais}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last= |date=2007-05-25 |orig-date=updated 30 January 2012 |title=Houllier heading out of Lyon |url=https://www.uefa.com/news-media/news/01c1-0e6e51551348-d79150929e2f-1000--houllier-heading-out-of-lyon/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240417151932/https://www.uefa.com/news/01c1-0e6e51551348-d79150929e2f-1000--houllier-heading-out-of-lyon/ |archive-date=2024-04-17 |access-date=2024-04-17 |website=[[UEFA]] |language=en}}</ref> An official statement on Lyon's website stated that Houllier asked to be released from the last season of his contract and that request was granted by the president.

===Return to the France national team===
Houllier was reappointed to the role of technical director for the France national team in September 2007, replacing interim-incumbent [[Jean-Pierre Morlans]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-france-houllier/houllier-set-for-french-technical-director-role-idUKSP26998420070914 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628232754/https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-france-houllier/houllier-set-for-french-technical-director-role-idUKSP26998420070914 |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 June 2018 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=14 September 2007 |title=Houllier set for French technical director role}}</ref> Despite the team's poor performance during [[UEFA Euro 2008]], Houllier advised [[French Football Federation]] president [[Jean-Pierre Escalettes]] to keep faith with manager [[Raymond Domenech]]. This decision attracted criticism as France went on to be eliminated in the first round of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news |title=French federation boss to quit after WCup fiasco |first=Samuel |last=Petrequin |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |via=[[Taiwan News]] |date=29 June 2010 |url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/1303353}}</ref> Escalettes resigned from his post after the tournament, but Houllier chose not to step down. In an interview with [[Stéphane Mandard]] of ''[[Le Monde]]'', he denied responsibility for the failed campaign, stating that his responsibilities did not extend to the first team and that he was not Domenech's line manager.<ref>{{cite news |first=Stéphane |last=Mandard |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2010/07/10/gerard-houllier-l-equipe-de-france-etait-devenue-paranoiaque_1386205_3242.html |work=[[Le Monde]] |title=Gérard Houllier : "L'équipe de France était devenue paranoïaque" |language=fr |date=10 July 2010}}</ref>

On 8 September 2010, it was announced that English Premier League club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] had appointed Houllier as their new full-time manager, following the resignation of previous boss [[Martin O'Neill]] the month before.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/8969268.stm|title=Aston Villa appoint Gerard Houllier as new manager|date=8 September 2010|work=BBC Sport|access-date=8 September 2010}}</ref> In his first press conference at the club, it was revealed Houllier had not yet signed a contract and would not take charge of the club until a later date due to commitments with the French Football Federation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/New-Aston-Villa-boss-Gerard-Houllier-can-t-start-work-until-he-s-cleared-by-the-French-Football-Federation-so-Kevin-MacDonald-will-remain-in-charge-article576543.html |title=New Aston Villa boss Gerard Houllier can't start work until he's cleared by the French Football Federation so Kevin MacDonald will remain in charge |publisher=MirrorFootball.co.uk |date=10 September 2010 |access-date=28 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914031951/http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/New-Aston-Villa-boss-Gerard-Houllier-can-t-start-work-until-he-s-cleared-by-the-French-Football-Federation-so-Kevin-MacDonald-will-remain-in-charge-article576543.html |archive-date=14 September 2010 }}</ref>

Houllier's first match in charge was the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] match against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 22 September. Villa won the match 3–1, coming back from a goal down to progress to the next round of the competition.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Macaskill |first1=Sandy |title=Aston Villa 3 Blackburn Rovers 1: match report |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/league-cup/8018600/Aston-Villa-3-Blackburn-Rovers-1-match-report.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/league-cup/8018600/Aston-Villa-3-Blackburn-Rovers-1-match-report.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |access-date=6 September 2020 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=23 September 2010}}{{cbignore}}</ref> It was announced on 18 September 2010 that [[Gary McAllister]] had agreed to become his assistant manager, with [[Gordon Cowans]] also taking a role in Houllier's backroom staff.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~2157961,00.html |title=Gerard Houllier's backroom team announced, Latest News, Aston Villa |publisher=Avfc.co.uk |access-date=28 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920202922/http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10265~2157961%2C00.html |archive-date=20 September 2010}}</ref> Two days after the Blackburn match, he signed a three-year contract.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/9032375.stm |work=BBC News | title=Houllier finally signs Villa deal | date=24 September 2010}}</ref> However, Houllier's start at the club proved to be difficult.

The club had also been knocked out of the League Cup the previous month by [[Second City derby|local rivals]] [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].

In the [[List of English football transfers winter 2010–11|January transfer Window]], Houllier signed [[Kyle Walker]] on loan from Tottenham Hotspur in a bid to improve Villa's struggling defence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/aston-villa/8244649/Aston-Villa-sign-Tottenham-defender-Kyle-Walker-on-loan.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/aston-villa/8244649/Aston-Villa-sign-Tottenham-defender-Kyle-Walker-on-loan.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Aston Villa sign Tottenham defender Kyle Walker on loan|website=The Daily Telegraph}}{{cbignore}}</ref> This signing was followed by the arrival of [[Jean Makoun]] from Houllier's former club Lyon,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/574399-aston-villa-snap-up-jean-il-makoun-from-olympique-lyonnais|title=Aston Villa Snap Up Jean Il Makoun from Olympique Lyonnais|first=Blue|last=Roo|website=Bleacher Report}}</ref> before Sunderland's [[Darren Bent]] was brought to Villa Park in a deal that broke the club's transfer record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/18/darren-bent-aston-villa-sunderland|title=Darren Bent completes £24m move to Aston Villa from Sunderland|first=Staff and|last=agencies|date=18 January 2011|website=The Guardian}}</ref> Villa's January transfer window was rounded off with the loan signing of American international midfielder [[Michael Bradley (soccer)|Michael Bradley]] from [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]]. In February 2011, Houllier criticised the commitment of Villa defenders [[Habib Beye]] and [[Stephen Warnock]]. The pair were forced to train with the club's [[Aston Villa F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserve side]] and were not selected by the Frenchman, even when the club faced even more injury concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/71954.html |title=Gerard Houllier banishes Stephen Warnock and Habib Beye to reserves |publisher=ESPN.co.uk |date=4 February 2011 |access-date=28 April 2011}}</ref> After the defeat to Sunderland, Villa underwent a revival, winning five and drawing three of their next nine matches in the league and FA Cup, including defeating [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] 1–0 in a run which saw the team climb to 12th.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/aston-villa/tab/matches/season/2011/ |website=11v11.com |title=Aston Villa football club match record: 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9404335.stm |title=Aston Villa 4-1 Blackburn |date=26 February 2011}}</ref>

However, Villa were eliminated from the [[2010–11 FA Cup|FA Cup]] by Manchester City via a 3–0 away loss in early March 2011. Houllier chose to rest a number of key first-team players, a move that was criticised by fans and the media alike.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/9410462.stm |work=BBC News | title=Manchester City 3–0 Aston Villa | date=2 March 2011}}</ref> The club's league form also failed to improve. During a team-bonding exercise at a health spa in [[Leicestershire]], Villa defenders [[James Collins (footballer, born 1983)|James Collins]] and [[Richard Dunne]] were involved in a confrontation with club staff. The players were each fined two weeks' wages. However, Houllier said the incident did not affect team morale.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/aston-villa-fc/2011/03/18/dunne-and-collins-are-fined-by-villa/ |title=Dunne and Collins are fined by Villa|work= Express & Star |date=18 March 2011 |access-date=28 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11677_6820611,00.html |title=Houllier – Villa still united, Aston Villa News, Fixtures, Results, Transfers |publisher=Sky Sports |date=18 March 2011 |access-date=28 April 2011}}</ref> On 19 March, Villa faced local rivals [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the Premier League at Villa Park. Prior to the match, a banner reading, "Had enough, Houllier out" was unveiled by some supporters in the stadium's Holte End stand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenationalnews.com/gerard-houllier-is-experiencing-a-case-of-deja-vu-at-aston-villa-1.433732|title=Gerard Houllier is experiencing a case of deja vu at Aston Villa|website=The National|date=22 March 2011}}</ref> However, this was quickly removed by the club's stewarding staff. The away side won 1–0 thanks to a goal from [[Matt Jarvis]], claiming their first win against Aston Villa in 31 years. Towards the end of the match, the home fans once again verbally attacked Houllier with chants of "we want Houllier out" and "you don't know what you're doing", before giving a chorus of boos at the final whistle.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aston Villa 0–1 Wolverhampton Wanderers |url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2011/0319/277854-astonvilla_wolves/ |website=Raidió Teilifís Éireann |access-date=6 September 2020 |date=19 March 2011}}</ref>

On 20 April 2011, Houllier was admitted to hospital after falling ill during the night. His condition was said to be stable, but he was not able to be at Aston Villa's training session the following day, and was not able to attend their match against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on 23 April, or any subsequent matches of the 2010–11 season.

==Death==
Houllier died on 14 December 2020, aged 73, in [[Paris]], after a heart operation. Former Liverpool captain [[Steven Gerrard]] paid tribute to Houllier, saying, "He was more than just a manager" and that he shaped him into "a better player, a better person, a better leader".<ref>{{cite news |title=Gérard Houllier, former Liverpool and France manager, dies aged 73 |date=14 December 2020 |access-date=14 December 2020 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/14/gerard-houllier-former-liverpool-and-france-manager-dies-aged-73}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/55300386|title=Ex-Liverpool boss Houllier dies aged 73|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 December 2020|access-date=14 December 2020}}</ref><ref name="guardobit">{{Cite web|last=Mason|first=Peter|date=14 December 2020|title=Gérard Houllier obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/14/gerard-houllier-obituary|access-date=14 December 2020|work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/55316402|title=Houllier 'a special man' - Gerrard|work=BBC Sport}}</ref>
