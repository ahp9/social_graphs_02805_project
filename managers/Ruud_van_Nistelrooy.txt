'''Rutgerus Johannes Martinus van Nistelrooij''' ({{IPA|nl|ˈryt fɑn ˈnɪstəlroːi}}; born 1 July 1976), commonly known as '''Ruud''' '''van Nistelrooy''' ({{IPAc-en|v|æ|n|_|ˈ|n|ɪ|s|t|l̩|r|ɔɪ}}), is a Dutch professional [[Association football|football]] manager and former player who was most recently manager of [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. Widely regarded as one of the best strikers of his generation, Van Nistelrooy was the top scorer in three [[UEFA Champions League]] seasons and is the all-time Dutch [[European Cup and UEFA Champions League records and statistics#All-time top scorers|top goalscorer]] in the competition's history with 56 goals. He has also been the top scorer in three European domestic leagues.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tighe |first=Sam |title=Ranking the Top 60 Strikers of All Time |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1954831-ranking-the-top-60-strikers-of-all-time |access-date=23 May 2024 |website=Bleacher Report |language=en}}</ref> In 2004, he was listed in the [[FIFA 100]] of the world's greatest living players.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3533891.stm |title=Pele's list of the greatest |work=BBC Sport |date=4 March 2004 |access-date=16 November 2013 |archive-date=19 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181019205959/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3533891.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Van Nistelrooy began his career with [[FC Den Bosch|Den Bosch]], before moving onto [[SC Heerenveen|Heerenveen]], eventually making a name for himself at [[PSV Eindhoven]], where he won two [[Eredivisie]] titles. His goalscoring record at PSV attracted attention from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]; a deal was in place in the summer of 2000, but because of injury problems, his move was secured a year later for a then British record fee of £19&nbsp;million. His time at United was successful, winning the [[2002–03 FA Premier League|Premier League]], [[2003–04 FA Cup|FA Cup]], [[2005–06 Football League Cup|Football League Cup]], and [[FA Community Shield]], along with winning the [[Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year]] twice. Van Nistelrooy scored 150 goals in just 219 games for United, as well as becoming at the time their all-time European record goalscorer, but fell out of favour towards the end of his tenure. 

[[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] secured Van Nistelrooy's services in 2006. Although an injury blighted the end of his days with Madrid, he won [[La Liga]] twice and the [[Supercopa de España]] before signing for [[Hamburger SV]] during the January transfer window in 2010. After one and a half seasons with Hamburg, he moved back to Spain with [[Málaga CF|Málaga]] in the summer of 2011. He retired as a player in 2012.

Internationally, Van Nistelrooy represented the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] on 70 occasions, netting 35 times. He was part of the [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]], [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], and [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] squads.

At the start of the [[2005–06 FA Premier League|2005–06 season]], Van Nistelrooy scored in United's first four Premier League games. He finished as the second-highest league scorer with 21 goals, behind Arsenal's Thierry Henry. However, he was benched for the [[2006 Football League Cup Final|League Cup Final]] against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], fuelling speculation of a rift between him and Alex Ferguson, which Van Nistelrooy denied. He was nonetheless left on the bench for six consecutive league matches, and though he then returned to the starting line-up and scored match-winners against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], fresh doubt spread over Van Nistelrooy's future when he was benched for United's season finale win over Charlton Athletic.
