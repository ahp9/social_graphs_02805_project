His career included periods playing for and later managing the [[England national football team|England national team]] and being a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]-winning manager at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].

Robson's professional playing career as an [[inside forward]] spanned nearly 20 years, during which he played for three clubs: [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], and, briefly, [[Vancouver Royals]]. He also made 20 appearances for England, scoring four goals. After his playing career, he found success as both a club and international manager, winning league championships in both the Netherlands and Portugal, earning trophies in England and Spain, and taking England to the [[West Germany v England (1990 FIFA World Cup)|semi-finals]] of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], which remained the national team's best run in a World Cup since [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]] until they reached the semi-finals of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]]. His last management role was as a mentor to the manager of the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]], while his final official club job was at boyhood club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], whom he left in 2004. He held several managerial positions outside of England, most notably one year at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 1996–97, as well as stints at [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], [[Sporting CP]] and [[FC Porto|Porto]].

Robson was created a [[Knight Bachelor]] in 2002, was inducted as a member of the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2003, and was the honorary president of Ipswich Town. From 1991 onwards, he had recurrent medical problems with cancer, and in March 2008, put his name and efforts into the [[Sir Bobby Robson Foundation]], a cancer research charity which had raised over £12&nbsp;million as of March 2018.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stott|first1=Matt|title=Ipswich: Sir Bobby Robson Foundation reaches £7m milestone as Mick Mills and Alan Shearer join Lady Elsie Robson in thanking fundraisers|url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/ipswich_sir_bobby_robson_foundation_reaches_7m_milestone_as_mick_mills_and_alan_shearer_join_lady_elsie_robson_in_thanking_fundraisers_1_3480685?usurv=completed|newspaper=East Anglian Daily Times|location=Ipswich|access-date=2 July 2014|archive-date=14 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714201517/http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/ipswich_sir_bobby_robson_foundation_reaches_7m_milestone_as_mick_mills_and_alan_shearer_join_lady_elsie_robson_in_thanking_fundraisers_1_3480685?usurv=completed|url-status=dead}}</ref> In August 2008, his lung cancer was confirmed to be terminal; he said, "My condition is described as static and has not altered since my last bout of [[chemotherapy]]...

Robson's final game in charge of England was the third-place play off against hosts [[Italy national football team|Italy]], which England lost 2–1. He then took on the role as manager of PSV Eindhoven, and [[Graham Taylor]] was announced as his successor.

=== European club management ===
Before the 1990 World Cup, the FA told Robson it would not renew his contract as England manager, so he moved to the Netherlands to coach [[PSV Eindhoven]],<ref name=espn/><ref name="Guardian"/> succeeding manager [[Guus Hiddink]], who had left the team after leading them to [[1987–88 European Cup|European Cup]] victory and four consecutive [[Eredivisie]] titles.

The Dutch penchant for tactical debate surprised Robson. In an interview with ''Voetbal International'', he lamented: "An English pro accepts the manager's decision. After every match here, the substitutes come and visit me."<ref>Kuper, p96</ref> Another of his challenges at PSV was handling the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian international]] [[Romário]].

Robson defeated [[Colorectal cancer|bowel cancer]] in 1992, a malignant melanoma in 1995, as well as a [[Tumor|tumour]] in his right lung and a brain tumour, both in 2006. Treatment of these conditions had left him partially [[paralyse]]d due to a stroke caused by the brain tumour, and also with a partially [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] upper jaw after the melanoma was surgically removed. His fifth diagnosis of cancer in 2007, consisting of cancerous nodules in both lungs, was diagnosed as [[Terminal illness|terminal]] in February 2007, and as of December 2008, was being controlled through bouts of [[chemotherapy]].<ref name="Journal25Mar08HallTreatments">{{cite news
