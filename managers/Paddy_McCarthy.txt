'''Patrick Richard McCarthy''' (born 31 May 1983) is an Irish former professional [[association football|footballer]] who played as a [[centre-back]]. He is currently assistant manager at [[Premier League]] club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland men's national team]].

Born in [[Dublin]], he began his football career as a junior with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] before joining [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 2005 where he spent three seasons before joining [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in the summer of 2007. He remained with Charlton for just twelve months, joining Crystal Palace in the summer of 2008 where he remained until 2016. McCarthy has also played for [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]] and [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on loan during the early part of his career and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], also as a loan player.

Having previously been the coach of Crystal Palace's under-18s and under-21s teams since 2016, McCarthy was appointed caretaker manager of the first team in March 2023, following the departure of manager [[Patrick Vieira]], and then became the assistant manager during [[Roy Hodgson]]'s second spell at the club.

==Club career==
McCarthy was born in [[Dublin]].<ref name="Hugman2010-11"/> He joined [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in March 2005 for a fee of £100,000 from [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], signing a three-year contract.<ref name="Foxes land City stopper">{{cite news| title = Foxes land City stopper| url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11679_2328528,00.html| publisher = Sky Sports| date = 3 March 2005| accessdate = 15 April 2009}}</ref> He had never played for Manchester City's first team but had enjoyed loan spells at [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]] and [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] during 2002 and 2003. Boston had made a bid to sign McCarthy on a permanent basis in February 2003.<ref name="Boston bid for McCarthy">{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/boston_united/2795453.stm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023145454/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/boston_united/2795453.stm |archive-date=23 October 2009 |title=Boston bid for McCarthy |publisher= BBC Sport|date=24 February 2003 |url-status=live |access-date=23 October 2013}}</ref>

McCarthy became a favourite with the Leicester fans, due to his no-nonsense style of play, and in July 2006 was named club captain for the [[2006-07 Leicester City F.C. season|2006–07 season]]. His season was cut short when he dislocated his shoulder in a training accident in February 2007.<ref name="McCarthy shoulder blow for Foxes">{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/6355467.stm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219150456/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/6355467.stm |archive-date=19 February 2007 |title=McCarthy shoulder blow for Foxes |publisher= BBC Sport|date=15 February 2007 |url-status=live |access-date=23 October 2013}}</ref> Nonetheless, McCarthy expressed his wish to leave Leicester before the start of next season, despite being offered a new contract.<ref name="Allen regrets McCarthy departure">{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/6731369.stm|title=Allen regrets McCarthy departure|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 June 2007|access-date=23 October 2013}}</ref>

McCarthy moved to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] for a fee of £650,000 in June 2007,<ref name="charlton signing">{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/club_stats/7451565.stm|title=Palace sign McCarthy from Addicks |publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 June 2008|access-date=23 October 2013}}</ref> but spent only a year at [[The Valley (London)|The Valley]], moving across south-east London to sign for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the summer of 2008, with [[Mark Hudson (footballer born 1982)|Mark Hudson]] travelling in the opposite direction.<ref name="charlton signing" /> McCarthy was troubled by a series of shoulder injuries which restricted him from playing in much of the [[2008–09 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2008–09]] and the [[2009–10 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2009–10]] seasons, but this did not stop him being named Palace captain in the run-up to the [[2010–11 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2010–11 season]].

McCarthy missed the entire [[2012–13 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2012–13 season]] with a groin injury, and made only one appearance in the subsequent [[Premier League]] season.<ref name="1314 stats" /> Despite this, he signed a one-year contract extension with Palace in September 2014.<ref name="contract extension">{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/september/mccarthy-extends-eagles-contract/|title=McCarthy Extends Eagles Contract|publisher=Crystal Palace F.C.|date=26 September 2014|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> Despite being given a new deal, first-team chances remained limited, and so, on 3 October 2014, McCarthy joined [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on an initial one-month loan deal<ref name="blades loan">{{cite news|title=Sheffield United confirm deal to sign Paddy McCarthy on loan from Crystal Palace|url=http://www.sheffieldtelegraph.co.uk/sport/sheffield-united/blades-sheffield-united-confirm-deal-to-sign-paddy-mccarthy-on-loan-from-crystal-palace-1-6875065|accessdate=3 October 2014|publisher=Sheffield Telegraph|date=3 October 2014}}</ref> and made his debut the following day as United lost 3–2 away at [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Chesterfield 3 Sheffield United 2: Higdon and Lee see red in Blades loss|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/sheffield-u/chesterfield-3-sheffield-united-2-higdon-and-lee-see-red-in-blades-loss-1-6878022|accessdate=19 October 2014|newspaper=Yorkshire Post|date=4 October 2014}}</ref> His first goal for the Blades came in the next match in a 2–2 draw against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] at [[Bramall Lane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/314461/report|title=O's hold Blades in thriller|publisher=Sky Sports|date=11 October 2014|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref> At the end of the loan period McCarthy returned to Palace and was named amongst the substitutes for an away fixture against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 8 November.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.premierleague.com/content/premierleague/en-gb/matchday/matches/2014-2015/epl.match-report.html/man-utd-vs-crystal-palace| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141109183748/http://www.premierleague.com/content/premierleague/en-gb/matchday/matches/2014-2015/epl.match-report.html/man-utd-vs-crystal-palace| archive-date = 9 November 2014| title = Fixture {{!}} Man Utd vs Crystal Palace}}</ref> However, on 11 November, it was confirmed that McCarthy's loan with the Blades had been renewed until 28 December 2014.<ref name="loan extension">{{cite news|title=Sheffield United receive timely boost ahead of Doncaster Rovers derby as Paddy McCarthy returns on loan|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/sheff-utd/sheffield-united-receive-timely-boost-ahead-of-doncaster-rovers-derby-as-paddy-mccarthy-returns-on-loan-1-6944674|accessdate=11 November 2014|publisher=Sheffield Star|date=11 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/november/mccarthy-rejoins-blades-on-loan/|title=- News}}</ref> In his first game back at United, McCarthy was sent off in a Yorkshire derby away at [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] with ten men United eventually going on to win 1–0.<ref>{{cite news|title=Doncaster Rovers 0 Sheffield United 1: Murphy earns 10-man Blades derby honours|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/football/doncaster/doncaster-rovers-0-sheffield-united-1-murphy-earns-10-man-blades-derby-honours-1-6955201|accessdate=16 November 2014|publisher=The Yorkshire Post|date=15 November 2014}}</ref>

McCarthy signed for Bolton Wanderers on loan in March 2015, a prankster had telephoned the [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] manager [[Tony Pulis]] pretending to be Bolton manager [[Neil Lennon]] weeks previously, with an enquiry for [[Gareth McAuley]] as the main point of interest. Pulis himself recommended his old Palace captain McCarthy, whom Bolton duly signed in an unconnected incident later in the season. McCarthy made five appearances in a Bolton shirt, but had to return to Palace after picking up an injury in Wanderers 2–2 draw with [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] at [[Griffin Park]].

McCarthy signed for newly promoted [[Preston North End]] on 3 October on a 93-day loan, and went straight into the squad to make his debut against [[Sheffield Wednesday]] on the same day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paddy McCarthy Goes On Loan|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2015/october/paddy-mccarthy-goes-on-loan/|website=cpfc.co.uk|date=3 October 2015|accessdate=3 October 2015}}</ref> However, he was substituted after ten minutes due to injury.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34366117| title = Sheffield Wednesday 3-1 Preston North End - BBC Sport}}</ref>

On 13 June 2016, it was announced that McCarthy would be released by Crystal Palace on expiry of his contract on 30 June.<ref>{{cite web|title=Six Players Released By Crystal Palace|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2016/june/six-players-released-by-crystal-palace/|website=cpfc.co.uk|date=13 June 2016|accessdate=20 June 2016}}</ref>

==International career==
McCarthy represented the Ireland Under-16 team at the [[2000 UEFA European Under-16 Championship]] and the Under-19 team at the [[2002 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]].
He appeared for the Under-21 and B side too. 
In September 2009 McCarthy received a call up by then manager [[Giovanni Trapattoni]] for a friendly against [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] played in [[Limerick]], where he was an unused substitute.

==Coaching career==
On 2 December 2016, six months after his retirement from playing, McCarthy was appointed under-18s coach at Crystal Palace, replacing Ken Gillard, who left the club in November to join Arsenal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mobile.cpfc.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/former-captain-paddy-mccarthy-to-take-over-as-coach-of-the-clubs-under-18-side.-3447958.aspx|title=Former captain Paddy McCarthy to take over as coach of the club's under 18 side.|date=2 December 2016|work=www.cpfc.co.uk|access-date=3 December 2016}}{{Dead link|date=July 2025 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

On 17 March 2023, after the sacking of manager [[Patrick Vieira]], the club announced that McCarthy would take over as first-team manager on an interim basis.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Paddy McCarthy to manage Palace at Arsenal - News |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/announcement/paddy-mccarthy-crystal-palace-arsenal/ |access-date=17 March 2023 |website=Crystal Palace F.C. |language=en-GB}}</ref> His only match in charge was a 4–1 away loss to league leaders [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42672226|title=Arsenal 4–1 Crystal Palace|work=BBC Sport|date=19 March 2023|access-date=21 March 2023|language=en}}</ref> Following the re-appointment of [[Roy Hodgson]] as first-team manager, McCarthy became assistant manager.

On 19 February 2024, McCarthy was once again appointed caretaker manager following the resignation of Hodgson,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/announcement/club-statement-roy-hodgson/|title=Statement: Roy Hodgson|website=www.cpfc.co.uk|date=19 February 2024|accessdate=19 February 2024}}</ref> and over-saw his only game, being a 1–1 away draw against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] that same day. McCarthy immediately became part of the coaching team for [[Oliver Glasner]] who had been confirmed the permanent Palace manager just before the Everton match.
