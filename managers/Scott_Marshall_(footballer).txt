'''Scott Roderick Marshall''' (born 1 May 1973) is a Scottish football coach and former professional [[association football|footballer]].

As a player, he was a [[defender (association football)|defender]] who notably played in the [[Premier League]] for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and in the [[Scottish Premiership]] for [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. He also played in the [[Football League]] for [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] and [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]]. He was capped at [[Scotland national under-16 football team|Scotland U16]], [[Scotland national under-19 football team|U18]] and [[Scotland national under-21 football team|U21]] level.

Following retirement, he returned to Brentford as a youth team coach before running the Arsenal soccer school in [[Oman]]. He moved on to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] as the head coach of their under-21s before joining the coaching staff at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. In 2015 he had a spell as caretaker manager, a role he repeated during his time at [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] three years later. 

He was appointed as assistant manager of [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in July 2021 before leaving alongside [[Ben Garner]] to become assistant coach at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in June 2022.

In March 2023, Garner was named head coach at [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] and appointed Marshall as his assistant coach.

==Playing career==
Marshall started his playing career at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and broke into their first team at the age of 19, winning five [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] under-21 caps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/scotlandu21/player.php?playerid=250|title=Scotland U21 Player Scott Marshall Details|website=www.fitbastats.com}}</ref> He scored his only goal for the Gunners in their 2–0 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in March 1996<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-doubts-beset-newcastle-1343932.html|title=Doubts beset Newcastle |work=[[The Independent]] |date=23 March 1996 |accessdate=20 December 2009| location=London| first=Glenn| last=Moore}}</ref> and at the end of that season was voted as Arsenal's Young Player of the Year by the supporters.<ref name=Arsenal>{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/profiles/437/scott-marshall|title=Scott Marshall|website=Arsenal.com|access-date=14 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314153106/http://www.arsenal.com/history/profiles/437/scott-marshall|archive-date=14 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In seven seasons with Arsenal he only made 27 appearances, spending spells on loan at [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jkarlsson.netfirms.com/players/m/marshall_sr/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726053512/http://jkarlsson.netfirms.com/players/m/marshall_sr/ |archive-date=26 July 2011 |title=Arsenal FC player archive: Scott Marshall |accessdate=11 January 2008 |work=jkarlsson.netfirms.com}}</ref> He made three league appearances as Arsenal won the [[1997-98 Premier League]], however this was not enough to qualify for a winners' medal.<ref>{{Soccerbase season|4849|1997|name=Scott Marshall|access-date=17 November 2013}}</ref>

In August 1998, [[Dave Jones (footballer, born 1956)|Dave Jones]] signed him for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on a free transfer. Saints thought they had made a transfer coup, but Marshall soon showed why Arsenal let him go, scoring an own goal in his debut against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in a 3–0 defeat on 8 September 1998, repeating this four days later in a 4–0 defeat at Newcastle United.<ref name= ITN>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last1= Holley |first1= Duncan |last2= Chalk|first2= Gary |publisher=Hagiology Publishing | year=2003 | isbn=0-9534474-3-X|page=545}}</ref>

He never appeared again for Saints and went out on loan to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], where his only appearance was in an [[Old Firm]] derby with [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in May 1999.<ref name = "forster"/> Marshall ended up on the wrong end of a 3–0 scoreline, a game which saw Celtic's bitter rivals win the league at [[Celtic Park]].<ref name = "forster"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/scottish_premier/334094.stm |title=Rangers make history out of chaos|publisher=BBC|date=3 May 1999 |access-date=21 September 2012}}</ref> This meant that Marshall had featured in just three league games in the 1998–99 season (two for Southampton and one for Celtic), had lost all three and had conceded ten goals.<ref>{{Soccerbase season|4849|1998|name=Scott Marshall|access-date=21 September 2012}}</ref>

Marshall then joined [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in October 1999 for a fee of £250,000. Unfortunately, after scoring yet another own goal in his third appearance for the Bees, he then suffered back problems which caused him to miss most of the 2001–02 season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://world.brentfordfc.co.uk/page/LatestNews/0,,10421~293829,00.html |title=Brentford {{!}} News {{!}} Latest News {{!}} Latest News {{!}} MARSHALL RETURNS |date=30 October 2002 |website=world.brentfordfc.co.uk |access-date=18 February 2018}}</ref> After battling his way back to fitness, he at last gained regular first team football making a total of 94 appearances for the Bees, scoring seven goals.<ref name=Bees>{{cite web|url=http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/southampton/news/12330/remember-scott-marshall-!|title=Remember Scott Marshall|website=Fans Network.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=4849|title=Scott Marshall:Stats|website=Soccerbase.com}}</ref> Marshall was released at the end of the [[2002–03 Brentford F.C. season|2002–03]] season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://world.brentfordfc.co.uk/page/LatestNews/0,,10421~394872,00.html |title=Brentford {{!}} News {{!}} Latest News {{!}} Latest News {{!}} MARSHALL RELEASED |date=1 July 2003 |website=world.brentfordfc.co.uk |access-date=19 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212084209/http://world.brentfordfc.co.uk/page/LatestNews/0,,10421~394872,00.html |archive-date=12 February 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
