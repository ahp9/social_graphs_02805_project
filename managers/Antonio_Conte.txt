Playing as a [[midfielder]], Conte began his career at local club [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] and later became one of the most decorated and influential players in the history of [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] having won, among others, five Serie A titles, one [[Coppa Italia]], one [[UEFA Champions League]], and one [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], also serving as the team's [[Captain (association football)|captain]] from 1996 until 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/242/178/4/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816094057/http://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/242/178/4/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 August 2014|title=Conte ready to carve out his Italy vision|publisher=[[FIFA]]|access-date=11 September 2014}}</ref> He also played for the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] and was a participant at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000]], where, on both occasions, Italy finished runners-up.

His managerial career started in 2006, leading [[FC Bari 1908|Bari]] to a [[2008–09 Serie B|Serie B]] title, and [[S.S. Robur Siena|Siena]] to promotion from the same division two years later. He took over at Juventus in 2011 and won three consecutive Serie A titles before taking charge of the Italy national team in 2014 until [[UEFA Euro 2016]] where he led them to the quarter-finals. He then became [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] manager and led them to the Premier League title in his [[2016–17 Premier League|first season]] in charge,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/only-antonio-conte-could-have-won-the-premier-league-title-with-chelseas-squad-writes-tony-evans-a3539436.html|title=Only Antonio Conte could have won the Premier League title with Chelsea's squad, writes Tony Evans|access-date=4 April 2018|archive-date=13 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713234652/https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/only-antonio-conte-could-have-won-the-premier-league-title-with-chelseas-squad-writes-tony-evans-a3539436.html|url-status=live}}</ref> then winning the [[FA Cup]] in his second season but being dismissed as they finished fifth in the league.

==Playing career==
===Club career===
====Lecce====
Conte began his career with the youth team of his hometown club [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] and made his [[Serie A]] debut with the first team on 6 April 1986, aged 16, in a 1–1 draw against [[A.C. Pisa 1909|Pisa]]. Under manager [[Carlo Mazzone]], he became a fundamental player for the squad. In 1987, he fractured his [[tibia]], risking a career-ending injury. During the [[1988–89 Serie A|1988–89 season]], he was back on the pitch and scored his first Serie A goal on 11 November 1989 in a 3–2 loss to [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]]. He amassed 99 appearances and one goal for Lecce.<ref name="tuttojuve.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttojuve.com/gli-eroi-bianconeri/gli-eroi-in-bianconero-antonio-conte-198997|title=Gli eroi in bianconero: Antonio CONTE|publisher=Tutto Juve|language=it|first=Stefano|last=Bedeschi|access-date=11 September 2014|archive-date=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104211232/https://www.tuttojuve.com/gli-eroi-bianconeri/gli-eroi-in-bianconero-antonio-conte-198997|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="treccani">{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/antonio-conte_(Enciclopedia-dello-Sport)|title=CONTE, Antonio|publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport (2002)|language=it|first=Sergio|last=Rizzo|access-date=2 November 2016|archive-date=4 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104130020/http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/antonio-conte_(Enciclopedia-dello-Sport)|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Juventus====

Conte was signed by [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] manager [[Giovanni Trapattoni]] in 1991 (Conte refers to Trapattoni as being his "second father"),<ref>[https://sport.sky.it/calcio/2019/03/17/conte-trapattoni-intervista Antonio Conte racconta il Trap: "Un secondo padre"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210118234155/https://sport.sky.it/calcio/2019/03/17/conte-trapattoni-intervista |date=18 January 2021 }} (in Italian) ''Sport.sky.it''</ref> debuting on 17 November 1991 against [[Derby della Mole|cross-city rivals]] [[Torino F.C.|Torino]].<ref name="conte_debut">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg8hm702kwU |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/Sg8hm702kwU |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=17-11-1991, l'esordio bianconero di Conte – Conte's Juventus debut |date=17 November 2011 |publisher=Juventus F.C. YouTube |access-date=6 January 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Due to his consistent performances, work-rate, leadership and tenacious playing style, he became an important figure with the club's fans, and was later named the team's captain under [[Marcello Lippi]] in 1996, following the departure of the club's previous captain [[Gianluca Vialli]], and before the promotion of [[Alessandro Del Piero]] to the role. During the [[1998–99 Serie A|1998–99 season]], when Del Piero suffered a severe knee injury, Conte returned to the captaincy, a position which he maintained until the [[2001–02 Serie A|2001–02 season]]. During his Juventus playing career, Conte won five [[Serie A]] titles, the [[1994–95 Coppa Italia]], the [[1992–93 UEFA Cup]], the [[1995–96 UEFA Champions League]], four [[Supercoppa Italiana]] titles, the [[1996 UEFA Super Cup]], the [[1996 Intercontinental Cup]] (which he missed due to injury), and the [[1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup]], winning all possible top-tier club titles, aside from the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]].

Conte's team finished as runner-up in the Champions League on three occasions, as Juventus lost the Champions League finals of [[1997 UEFA Champions League final|1997]], [[1998 UEFA Champions League final|1998]], and [[2003 UEFA Champions League final|2003]]. In the 2003 final, against [[AC Milan]], he came on as a substitute in the second half and produced Juventus' best chance of the match, hitting the crossbar with a header, but Juventus eventually lost on penalties.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/henrywinter/2404912/Shevchenko-the-Milan-master.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/henrywinter/2404912/Shevchenko-the-Milan-master.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Shevchenko the Milan master|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Henry|last=Winter|date=29 May 2003|access-date=2 November 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Conte also finished runner-up in the [[1995 UEFA Cup final]] with Juventus. He remained with Juventus until his retirement in [[2003–04 Serie A|2004]]. During his 13 seasons with Juventus, he made 295 appearances and scored 29 goals in Serie A, and 418 appearances and 43 goals in all competitions.<ref name="tuttojuve.com"/><ref name="treccani"/>

===International career===

Conte also played for the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]], making his debut on 27 May 1994, in a 2–0 friendly win over [[Finland national football team|Finland]] at age 24, under [[Arrigo Sacchi]]. He was a member of the Italian squads for both the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] under Sacchi, and [[UEFA Euro 2000]] under [[Dino Zoff]], achieving runners-up medals in both tournaments. He missed out on the [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]] squad after sustaining an injury in the 1996 Champions League final.<ref name="tuttojuve.com"/><ref name="treccani"/> Conte scored a [[bicycle kick]] in Italy's opening match of Euro 2000, which ended in a 2–1 win against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]],<ref name="tuttojuve.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/turkey/786458.stm|title=Harsh penalty hands Italy victory|date=11 June 2000|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=25 June 2011|archive-date=10 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200910060117/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/turkey/786458.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> although he later suffered an injury in a 2–0 win against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the quarter-finals of the competition, following a challenge from [[Gheorghe Hagi]], which ruled him out for the remainder of the competition.<ref name="tuttojuve.com"/><ref name="treccani"/> In total, he made 20 international appearances for Italy between 1994 and 2000, scoring twice.<ref name="treccani"/><ref name="Nazionale in cifre">{{cite web|url=http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=339&squadra=1|title=Conte, Antonio|publisher=Italian Football Federation|language=it|access-date=2 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322165643/http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=339&squadra=1|archive-date=22 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Style of play===
Conte was regarded as a quick, combative, energetic, and tactically versatile footballer throughout his career who could play anywhere in midfield but was usually deployed as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central]], [[Midfielder#Box-to-box midfielder|box-to-box]], or [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]], and occasionally on the [[Midfielder#Winger|right flank]], due to his [[Cross (football)|crossing]] ability.<ref name="tuttojuve.com"/><ref name="UEFA">{{UEFA coach|id=19222|name=Antonio Conte|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref name="espn-profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/euro2000/italy/player/conte.html|title=Profile: Antonio Conte|publisher=[[ESPN FC]]|first=Gary M.|last=Prior|date=13 July 2000|access-date=22 February 2017|archive-date=23 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223043519/http://www.espnfc.com/euro2000/italy/player/conte.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Although he was not the most naturally talented or skilful footballer from a technical standpoint (although he was able to improve in this area with time), Conte was a hard-working, consistent and intelligent player, with an innate ability to read the game, who was mainly known for his leadership, strong mentality, accurate tackling, stamina, and vision; these attributes, coupled with his solid first touch, work-rate, tenacity, and a tendency to make offensive runs into the area, enabled him to aid his team effectively both defensively and offensively, and gave him the ability to distribute the ball and start attacking moves after retrieving possession, as well as the capacity to turn defence into an attack.<ref name="tuttojuve.com"/><ref name="espn-profile"/><ref name="Great Italian tacticians influenced me, says Conte"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.corriere.it/sport/12_maggio_09/conte-intervista-sette_9ec84b8c-9a02-11e1-85ab-3c2c8bfb44fd.shtml |title=Sono un grande tecnico (e l'ho sempre saputo) |work=Il Corriere della Sera |language=it |last1=Barra |first1=Francesca |date=9 May 2012 |access-date=27 February 2020 |archive-date=21 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021061416/https://www.corriere.it/sport/12_maggio_09/conte-intervista-sette_9ec84b8c-9a02-11e1-85ab-3c2c8bfb44fd.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> Due to his ball-striking from distance and ability to get forward, he also scored some spectacular and decisive goals, often from volleys and strikes from outside the area. He was also considered to be physically strong, good in the air and accurate with his head, despite not being particularly tall. Despite his ability as a footballer, his career was often affected by injuries.<ref name="treccani"/><ref name="espn-profile"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/italy/squad/743093.stm|title=Euro 2000 Profile: Italy – Antonio Conte|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=11 September 2014|archive-date=6 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306045954/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/italy/squad/743093.stm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaziojuve.it/2014/conte-inzaghi-tutti-gli-uomini-ancelotti/ |title=Da Conte a Inzaghi, tutti gli uomini di Ancelotti |trans-title=From Conte to Inzaghi, all of Ancelotti's men |publisher=Spazio Juve |language=it |first=Mario|last=Basilico |date=9 June 2014 |access-date=17 September 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222125306/http://www.spaziojuve.it/2014/conte-inzaghi-tutti-gli-uomini-ancelotti/ |archive-date=22 December 2015  }}</ref>

==Coaching career==

===Arezzo===
[[File:Antonio Conte.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|left|Conte in 2005]]

After retiring from playing, Conte worked as an assistant manager for [[S.S. Robur Siena|Siena]] alongside [[Luigi De Canio]] in the 2005–06 season. In July 2006, he was appointed coach of [[Serie B]] side [[A.C. Arezzo|Arezzo]]. After a series of disappointing results, he was sacked on 31 October 2006.

On 13 March 2007, Conte was reinstated as Arezzo head coach as his predecessor [[Maurizio Sarri]] failed to gain any significant improvement with the club mired in a relegation struggle. He subsequently led the team to five consecutive wins, securing 19 points from 7 matches, which allowed the Tuscan side to close the points gap between them and safety. Despite this turnaround in form, Arezzo was relegated to [[Serie C1]] on the final day of the league season, finishing one point behind [[Spezia Calcio 1906|Spezia]].

===Bari===
On 27 December 2007, Conte was appointed by [[F.C. Bari 1908|Bari]] to replace [[Giuseppe Materazzi]] for the second half of their [[2007–08 Serie B]] campaign.<ref name="materazzi_resignation">{{cite news|url=http://www.lagazzettadelmezzogiorno.it/news/home/69493/calcio-bari-materazzi-si-dimette.html|title=Calcio / Bari – Materazzi si dimette|work=[[La Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno]]|date=28 December 2007|access-date=6 April 2017|language=it|archive-date=5 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105012034/https://www.lagazzettadelmezzogiorno.it/news/home/69493/calcio-bari-materazzi-si-dimette.html|url-status=live}}</ref> He oversaw a considerable upturn in form, leading the team out of the relegation battle and placing them comfortably mid-table. The following season, 2008–09, Bari were crowned Serie B champions, being promoted to Serie A for the [[2009–10 Serie A|2009–10 season]], Conte's first major honour as a manager.

In June 2009, after weeks of rumours linking Conte to the vacant managerial role at Juventus, he agreed in principle for a contract extension to keep him at Bari for the new season.

|quote=Because they are used to it here, they are used to it. They don't play for something important, yeah. They don't want to play under pressure, they don't want to play under stress. It is easy in this way. Tottenham's story is this. 20 years there is the owner and they never won something, but why? The fault is only for the club, or for every manager that stays here? I have seen the managers that Tottenham had on the bench. You risk to disrupt the figure of the manager and to protect the other situation in every moment.

Some commentators have also observed that, although Conte's teams are capable of playing a short passing possession game, in which the ball is played out from the back on the ground, they are mainly known for their direct style of attacking play, as well as their ability to utilise long balls and score from counter-attacks with few touches; however, Conte has rejected claims that his teams prefer to sit back and play on the counter-attack. Defensive solidity has been highlighted as a hallmark of his sides, as well as the effective use of high and aggressive pressing in order to put pressure on opponents and win back the ball quickly.

Conte's use of heavy pressing high up on the pitch allowed his players to win back the ball quickly after losing it, and enabled Juventus to dominate possession during matches, which gave Pirlo more time to orchestrate the team's attacking moves.{{#tag:ref|Juventus ref grouping:<ref name=Midfield/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/may/07/juventus-win-serie-a-title-milan|title=Unbeaten Juventus scale the barriers to be crowned champions again|work=The Guardian|first=Nicky|last=Bandini|date=7 May 2012|access-date=21 May 2017|archive-date=19 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819234544/https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/may/07/juventus-win-serie-a-title-milan|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="E' nata una grande Juve">{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Squadre/Juventus/06-12-2012/-nata-grande-juve-conte-avanza-senza-ariete-913429102697.shtml|title=E' nata una grande Juve Conte avanza senza l'ariete|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=it|author1=Paolo Condò|date=7 December 2012|access-date=21 May 2017|archive-date=19 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819231707/http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Squadre/Juventus/06-12-2012/-nata-grande-juve-conte-avanza-senza-ariete-913429102697.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/club/juventus/111/blog/post/1852199/juventus-struggle-for-a-point-against-fiorentina|title=Juventus struggle for a point against Fiorentina|publisher=ESPN FC|author1=Mina Rzouki|date=26 September 2012|access-date=21 May 2017|archive-date=19 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819233040/http://www.espnfc.us/club/juventus/111/blog/post/1852199/juventus-struggle-for-a-point-against-fiorentina|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/live-scores/nationalleagues/nationalleague=italy-serie-a-2000000026/news/newsid/162/930/8/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819234153/http://www.fifa.com/live-scores/nationalleagues/nationalleague=italy-serie-a-2000000026/news/newsid/162/930/8/|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 August 2017|title=Old Lady never more sprightly|publisher=FIFA.com|date=11 May 2012|access-date=21 May 2017}}</ref>}}

Conte's teams are also known for their versatility and ability to adopt different formations during a match, depending on whether his team are in possession or playing off the ball. At Euro 2016, Italy adopted a fluid 3–5–2 formation under Conte, in which the wide midfielders or wingbacks effectively functioned as wingers in a 3–3–4 formation when attacking, and as fullbacks in a 5–3–2 formation when defending behind the ball.<ref name="new special one"/> Although the level of talent in the Italian squad was initially criticised in the media,<ref name="never underestimate"/> Conte's tactics and Italy's solidity and organisation, from both a defensive and offensive standpoint, drew praise from pundits.{{#tag:ref|Wingback formations:<ref name="Conte's scheme works"/><ref name="Conte guides Italy to tactical masterclass"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/italy-vs-spain-euro-2016-reaction-antonio-conte-hails-his-azzurri-side-despite-not-the-rosiest-a7106536.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220507/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/italy-vs-spain-euro-2016-reaction-antonio-conte-hails-his-azzurri-side-despite-not-the-rosiest-a7106536.html |archive-date=7 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Italy vs Spain Euro 2016 reaction: Antonio Conte hails his Azzurri side despite 'not the rosiest period in talent'|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Glenn|last=Moore|date=27 June 2016|access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref><ref name="Conte made Italy genuine Euro 2016 contenders">{{cite news|first=JJ|last=Bull|title=How Antonio Conte made Italy genuine Euro 2016 contenders|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/07/02/how-antonio-conte-made-italy-genuine-euro-2016-contenders/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/07/02/how-antonio-conte-made-italy-genuine-euro-2016-contenders/ |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=2 July 2016|access-date=2 February 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/4-ways-antonio-conte-can-implement-his-italian-style-chelsea|title=4 ways Antonio Conte can implement his Italian style at Chelsea|publisher=FourFourTwo|author1=John Robertson|date=24 June 2016|access-date=21 May 2017|archive-date=20 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820203509/https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/4-ways-antonio-conte-can-implement-his-italian-style-chelsea|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

In his first season as Chelsea manager, Conte started with a 4–1–4–1 formation, but after two comprehensive defeats to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] early in the season, he changed the system to a fluid [[Formation (association football)#3.E2.80.936.E2.80.931|3–4–2–1]], with his trademark three-man defence consisting of [[David Luiz]], [[César Azpilicueta]], and [[Gary Cahill]], two defensive-minded midfielders in [[N'Golo Kante]] and [[Nemanja Matić]], two wing-backs equally capable at also playing as wingers ([[Victor Moses]] and [[Marcos Alonso Mendoza|Marcos Alonso]]), and a three-man attack spearheaded by striker [[Diego Costa]] and crucially assisted by outside forwards [[Eden Hazard]] and [[Pedro (footballer, born July 1987)|Pedro]] or [[Willian (footballer, born 1988)|Willian]]. This system depends on the constant positional movement of attacking players, with the two wide forwards moving inside when the full-backs make overlapping forward runs, thus effectively forming a [[Formation (association football)#3.E2.80.934.E2.80.933|3–4–3]] and at times a [[Formation (association football)#3.E2.80.934.E2.80.931.E2.80.932|3–4–1–2]]. When losing the ball, players' quick defensive transitions make the system easily transform into a compact [[Formation (association football)#5.E2.80.934.E2.80.931|5–4–1]]. Chelsea's performances improved dramatically after the tactical change, with 13 consecutive wins in the [[2016–17 Premier League|Premier League]], and the club eventually went on to win the league title that season.

Although Conte's decision to reacquire David Luiz was initially met with criticism in the media, due to some poor defensive performances for Chelsea in the past, Conte's switch to a three-man back-line saw the Brazilian excel in a new role as a ball-playing centre-back, due to his technique and range of passing.

===Controversies===
Prior to [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]], Conte was accused of failure to report attempted match-fixing during his time as manager of Siena by ex-Siena player [[Filippo Carobbio]], connected with the [[2011–12 Italian football scandal|betting scandal of 2011–12]].<ref name="Antonio Conte ticks all the boxes but court case could be a distraction for Chelsea"/> Carobbio, after himself being charged with extensive involvement in the scandal, said that during the technical meeting prior to a match between Siena and [[Novara Calcio|Novara]], Siena owner Massimo Mezzaroma indirectly sent a message to the players asking them to ensure the match finished in a draw in order to help Mezzaroma turn a large profit on a bet he had made. The match finished 2–2, and Carobbio testified that Conte was present when the message was relayed to the players in advance of the match.<ref name="Antonio Conte ticks all the boxes but court case could be a distraction for Chelsea"/> Carrobio also asserted the result of the final match of the season, in which Siena lost 1–0 to [[U.C. AlbinoLeffe|AlbinoLeffe]], was prearranged after Siena's assistant manager asked he and another player "contact someone at AlbinoLeffe to reach an agreement over the return match".<ref name="Antonio Conte ticks all the boxes but court case could be a distraction for Chelsea"/> Further accusations were also leveled at Conte over Siena's 5–0 victory over [[Varese Calcio S.S.D.|Varese]] that season, specifically that he knew they had been asked to lose the game and did not report it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/10/italy/2012/05/30/3137368/conte-knew-siena-president-mezzaroma-asked-us-to-lose|title=Conte knew Siena president Mezzaroma asked us to lose, reveals Carobbio|publisher=Goal.com|first=Jeremy|last=Lim|date=30 May 2012|access-date=12 April 2014|archive-date=12 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140612231340/http://www.goal.com/en/news/10/italy/2012/05/30/3137368/conte-knew-siena-president-mezzaroma-asked-us-to-lose|url-status=live}}</ref>

Despite Conte's success at Juventus, there were indications that his departure from the club in May 2014 was not as amicable as had been portrayed, with observers pointing to a comment he made in the immediate aftermath of the club's 2014 title success. When asked what plans were in place for the following season, Conte responded, "Well, you cannot go to eat at a €100 restaurant with just €10 in your pocket, can you?", which was interpreted as a veiled criticism of the lack of funds made available for transfers by the Juventus executive. In addition to this remark, Conte had chosen to resign on the second day of pre-season training, something that took fans by surprise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/conte-s-departure-from-juve-leaves-italian-football-guessing-1.1868089|title=Conte's departure from Juve leaves Italian football guessing|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|first=Paddy|last=Agnew|date=16 July 2014|access-date=17 August 2016|archive-date=18 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818125709/http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/conte-s-departure-from-juve-leaves-italian-football-guessing-1.1868089|url-status=live}}</ref>
