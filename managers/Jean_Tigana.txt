'''Amadou Jean Tigana''' (born 23 June 1955) is a French former [[Association football|football]] player and manager. A [[central midfielder]], he was renowned as one of the best midfielders in the world during the 1980s.<ref>[http://www.iffhs.de/?b40f8ca85bd0e027e8f05f4cb05fe4a41314a433ccd40385fdcdc3bfcdc0aec70aeedb8a3f0e03790c443e0f4039040f Europe's best Player of the Century] - IFFHS</ref> He spent his entire playing career in France, and made 52 appearances and scored one goal for the [[France national football team|France national team]]. Following his playing career, he became a manager, coaching clubs in France, England, Turkey and China.

==Club career==
Tigana started his professional career as a player at [[SC Toulon|Toulon]], having been spotted fairly late playing part-time while employed in a spaghetti factory and then as a postman. He moved to [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in 1978 and then to [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in a $4 million transfer. In Bordeaux's midfield for eight years, Tigana helped them to three league titles and three French cups, as well as taking them close to European glory on two occasions, losing in the semi-final of the European Cup and Cup Winners' Cup in 1985 and 1987 respectively.

He moved in 1989 to [[Olympique Marseille|Marseille]], and ended his career there following the 1990–91 season, winning two consecutive league titles,<ref name="Tigana-Fulham-Boss">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/707119.stm |title=Tigana named as Fulham boss |work=news.bbc.co.uk |date=9 April 2000 |access-date=19 December 2020 }}</ref> and reaching the [[1991 European Cup Final|European Cup final]] during the latter season, only to be defeated by [[Red Star Belgrade]] on penalties following a 0–0 draw.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-team-dismantled-by-war-red-star-belgrades-final-european-triumph/ |title=The Team Dismantled by War: Red Star Belgrade's Final European Triumph |publisher=Vice.com |last1=O'Connor |first1=Robert |date=5 June 2015 |access-date=19 December 2020 }}</ref>

==International career==
Tigana was born in [[Bamako]], French Sudan (now Mali) to a Malian father and a French mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2011/07/10/devoue-a-la-cause-du-mali-448463-8.php|title=Dévoué à la cause du Mali}}</ref> He represented France, and as an international Tigana joined [[Michel Platini]], [[Luis Fernandez]] and [[Alain Giresse]] in what was termed "the Magic Square" (le Carré Magique) – one of the greatest midfield foursomes of all time.<ref name="Tigana-Fulham-Boss"/> He was part of the France national football team that won [[UEFA Euro 1984]] on home soil, defeating [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the [[UEFA Euro 1984 Final|final]].<ref name="Tigana-Fulham-Boss"/> Tigana's single international goal came against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] finals, in which France managed a third-place finish.

==Playing style==
Tigana was a world-class [[Midfielder#Box-to-box midfielder|box-to box midfielder]], who usually played in the centre, and who was noted for his great movement, teamwork, pace and tireless stamina. Although Tigana was mainly responsible for his team's [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive]] duties, he also often ventured forward to create scoring opportunities for his teammates. His work ethic and expansive range of passing, from both long and short range, made him an excellent distributor which, when combined with his close control and simplistic yet efficient [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] technique, made him a world–class midfielder. He was also well known for his contributions in the more advanced areas of the pitch, due to his ability to spot and execute defence-splitting passes.

==Managerial career==
For his first managerial role, Tigana returned to [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], coaching them from 1993 to 1995, before moving on to [[AS Monaco|Monaco]] replacing [[Arsene Wenger]], where he remained until 1999. They were French league champions in 1997 and Champions League semi-finalists a year later, beating [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the quarter-finals.

He took over as manager of English club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in April 2000<ref name="Tigana-Fulham-Boss"/> and helped them to promotion from [[Football League First Division|Division One]] to the [[FA Premier League]] as champions in his first full season. They finished 13th in their first top-flight season for more than 30 years and qualified for the [[UEFA Cup]] (via the [[Intertoto Cup]]), but he was sacked in April 2003, even though Fulham were in no danger of going down at this stage.<ref name="scot">

Tigana then took Fulham to court for wrongful dismissal and won, winning a payout of over £2&nbsp;million.<ref name="ind">

In October 2005, after a two years plus game hiatus, he signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with [[Turkey|Turkish]] side [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]]. During that same season, Beşiktaş won the [[Fortis Turkey Cup|Turkish Cup]] following an eight years hiatus.

Immediately after winning the 2007 Turkish Cup, Tigana announced that he was to leave Beşiktaş at the end of the season. He left Beşiktaş with two games to play, after a contract termination agreement with club board.

On 25 May 2010, Tigana returned to [[Ligue 1]] coaching joining [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], replacing [[Laurent Blanc]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8702854.stm|title=Jean Tigana appointed Bordeaux coachdate=2010-05-25|work=BBC Sport  |publisher=BBC  |access-date=25 May 2010|date=25 May 2010}}</ref>

On 7 May 2011, after a severe defeat against Sochaux (0–4) and a verbal aggression from Bordeaux team fans against his daughter, who was in the stadium, he announced that he was to leave Bordeaux.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.girondins.com/tigana-jarrete.html|title=Tigana – " J'arrête "|language=fr|date=2011-05-07|publisher=[[FC Girondins de Bordeaux]]|access-date=8 May 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511070236/http://www.girondins.com/tigana-jarrete.html|archive-date=11 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/90/france/2011/05/07/2476125/jean-tigana-steps-down-as-bordeaux-coach|title=Jean Tigana steps down as Bordeaux coach|date=2011-05-07|publisher=Goal.com|access-date=8 May 2011}}</ref>

On 18 December 2011, it was announced that Tigana would coach [[Shanghai Shenhua F.C.|Shanghai Shenhua]] from the 2012 season. On 15 April 2012, Tigana resigned as manager of Shanghai Shenhua after a run of poor form, leaving the Chinese club in the bottom five of its domestic league.
