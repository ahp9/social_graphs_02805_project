'''Philip Brown''' (born 30 May 1959) is an English former professional [[association football|footballer]] and coach who is currently manager of {{English football updater|PeterboS}} club [[Peterborough Sports F.C.|Peterborough Sports]].

As a player, Brown was a [[right-back]] who made over six hundred league appearances in an eighteen-year career, but never made it to the top flight. However, as a manager, he became the first to lead [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] to the top division in their 104-year history, winning the [[Football League Championship play-offs|Championship play-offs]] in 2008 after a [[2008 Football League Championship play-off Final|1–0 win]] against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] at [[Wembley Stadium]]. He also guided Southend United to promotion from League Two to League One in 2014–15.

Since 2011, Brown has appeared as a match summariser on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]].

==Playing career==
Born in [[South Shields]], [[County Durham]],<ref name="Hugman"/> Brown started his career playing Sunday league football for South Shields side Red Duster in the South Shields Business Houses League, in the same team as Ray Dunbar and [[Bobby Davison]], who went on to play for [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].

As a professional, Brown played at [[Left back|full back]] for many years with [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]], followed by a spell at [[Halifax Town F.C.|Halifax Town]] (with fellow north-easterner [[Billy Ayre]] at both clubs and under him at the latter),<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/s/10/10886_preece_tribute_to_billy.html| title  = Preece tribute to Billy| work = [[Manchester Evening News]]| date = 20 April 2002| access-date = 30 December 2008}}</ref> In 1988, he moved to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], winning the [[Football League Trophy|Associate Members Cup]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,1004~535741,00.html |title=Bolton Wanderers &#124; Club &#124; History &#124; History &#124; 1980 – 1999 |access-date=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716194153/http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C1004~535741%2C00.html |archive-date=16 July 2011 }}</ref>

Brown joined [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in 1994, playing under [[Sam Allardyce]] until 1996 while also being his assistant manager.

==Managerial career==
===Coaching===
Brown's first coaching role was as assistant to [[Sam Allardyce]] at Blackpool.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/sports-news/You39re-a-disgrace-Brown-says.3763519.jp| title = You're a disgrace Brown, says Burgess| date = 11 February 2008| work = Blackpool Gazette| access-date = 30 December 2008| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081101230432/http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/sports-news/You39re-a-disgrace-Brown-says.3763519.jp| archive-date = 1 November 2008| url-status = dead}}</ref> He returned to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] after his playing career ended and served as assistant manager to [[Colin Todd]]. Following Todd's departure in 1999, he took charge of the team as [[caretaker manager]], winning four games out of five, until the appointment of Sam Allardyce. He then served as Allardyce's assistant for six years, before deciding to forge his own career as a manager.

===Derby County===
Brown's first full-time senior management position was at [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], where he succeeded [[George Burley]] in June 2005. His time at Derby County proved to be unsuccessful and he was sacked just seven months into his tenure in January 2006, after a 6–1 league defeat against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], followed by a 3–1 defeat to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester]] in the [[FA Cup]] fourth round. Derby were in 19th place when Brown departed.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/4664284.stm | work=BBC Sport | title=Manager Brown given sack by Derby | date=30 January 2006 | access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref>

===Hull City===
====Championship and promotion====
Brown was appointed as first-team coach at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on 27 October 2006 under [[Phil Parkinson]], and took over as joint caretaker manager alongside [[Colin Murphy (footballer born 1950)|Colin Murphy]] on 4 December after Parkinson's sacking, with Hull in 22nd place in the [[Football League Championship]]. After taking Hull out of the relegation zone with three wins and a draw in the six matches as caretaker manager, he was appointed as the permanent manager of the club on 4 January 2007, while Murphy continued as his assistant.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hull unveil Brown as new manager |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/6228967.stm |access-date=10 April 2021 |work=BBC Sport |date=4 January 2007}}</ref>

Brown went on to lead The Tigers to Championship safety and the following season won promotion to the [[Premier League|top level of English football]] for the first time in the club's 104-year history, by beating [[Bristol City]] at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] [[2008 Football League Championship play-off final|play-off final]] on 24 May 2008. Brown described this as "the best day of my life, without a shadow of a doubt".<ref name=po08>{{cite journal| title = Managing the Next Step| journal = City Magazine| issue = 34| page = 20| publisher = Hull City AFC| date = June 2008 }}</ref>

====Premier League====
Brown was rewarded with a new three-year contract, which he signed on the weekend of Hull City's first ever top-flight match, a 2–1 victory over [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on 16 August 2008.<ref>{{cite news| url        = http://www.sporthull.co.uk/football/hull_city/tigers_news/displayarticle.php?ID=7960| title      = Duffen's pride in Tigers| date       = 18 August 2008| newspaper  = Hull Daily Mail| access-date = 30 December 2008}}</ref> On 28 September Brown managed Hull to a 2–1 victory at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. It was only Arsenal's second defeat at the [[Emirates Stadium]] and was described by the Hull press as the greatest victory in the club's history. After a 1–0 victory at bottom of the table [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] the following weekend, and a 3–0 away victory at the also newly promoted [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], he was awarded the Manager of the Month award for Hull's performances in September.

The first nine games Hull spent as a top division club resulted in six wins as they occupied third place in the Premier League and were only being kept off the top by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] having superior goal difference.

The remainder of the season was not so easy for Brown, as the team struggled to pick up the remaining points necessary to avoid relegation, and he was involved in several controversial incidents. In November 2008 he was fined £1,000 and warned about his future conduct by the FA after he admitted a charge of improper conduct. The charge related to a game against Wigan in August which Hull lost 5–0.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/hullcity/3483774/Hull-City-manager-Phil-Brown-fined-and-warned-over-future-conduct-by-FA-Football.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130505100751/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/hullcity/3483774/Hull-City-manager-Phil-Brown-fined-and-warned-over-future-conduct-by-FA-Football.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=5 May 2013 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Hull City manager Phil Brown fined and warned over future conduct by FA | first=Steve | last=Wilson | date=19 November 2008 | access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref> On 26 December 2008, following a poor first-half performance which saw Hull 4–0 down in a league match at Manchester City, Brown conducted his half-time team-talk on the pitch, in full view of the crowd and at the end of the pitch where the Hull supporters were sitting.<ref>{{cite web |url         = http://football365.com/story/0,17033,8717_4705408,00.html |title       = Brown makes exhibition of Hull |date        = 27 December 2008 |publisher   = football365.com |access-date  = 30 December 2008 |url-status     = dead |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090527094333/http://football365.com/story/0,17033,8717_4705408,00.html |archive-date = 27 May 2009 }}</ref> He explained, "I thought it was nice and cold and I thought I would keep the boys alive because they looked as if they were dead.

Brown was again charged with misconduct for his behaviour in an FA Cup tie against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in January. During the match Brown and Newcastle manager [[Joe Kinnear]] were both sent to the stands after a confrontation in which Brown verbally abused Newcastle's assistant manager [[Chris Hughton]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/facup/4241783/Joe-Kinnear-and-Phil-Brown-see-red-as-Newcastle-exit-FA-Cup.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Joe Kinnear and Phil Brown see red as Newcastle exit FA Cup |first=Rob |last=Stewart |date=14 January 2009 |access-date=22 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526101431/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/facup/4241783/Joe-Kinnear-and-Phil-Brown-see-red-as-Newcastle-exit-FA-Cup.html |archive-date=26 May 2010 }}</ref> Brown admitted the charge and was subsequently fined £2,500 and warned as to his future conduct by the Football Association.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/7952942.stm|title=FA fines Brown for touchline row |date=19 March 2009|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|access-date=15 March 2010}}</ref>

On 17 March 2009, Brown claimed that he saw [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] midfielder and captain [[Cesc Fàbregas]] spit at the feet of his assistant manager [[Brian Horton]] following Hull's 2–1 FA Cup defeat and elimination at the [[Emirates Stadium]].

On 24 May 2009, despite suffering a 1–0 loss to a second-string Manchester United side, Brown led Hull City to survival in the Premier League due to [[Newcastle United]] losing to [[Aston Villa]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.football365.com/story/0,17033,8652_6028335,00.html |title=All The News &#124; Football News |publisher=Football365 |access-date=25 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322191436/http://www.football365.com/story/0,17033,8652_6028335,00.html |archive-date=22 March 2010 }}</ref> Hull finished in 17th place, one point above Newcastle, who also lost. Brown stated that this was the greatest achievement in his managerial career and the club's history. At the end of the game, Brown went onto the pitch with a microphone and started singing (a modified version of) "[[Sloop John B]]" to the crowd.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/8066339.stm|title=Hull boss Brown leads the singing|publisher=BBC|work=BBC Sport| date=24 May 2009| access-date=30 May 2009}}</ref>

In the summer of 2009, Brown looked to strengthen his side. He attempted to sign former England international striker [[Michael Owen]] and former Tiger [[Fraizer Campbell]], but was unsuccessful. Brown did manage to sign [[Seyi Olofinjana]], [[Jozy Altidore]] (on loan from [[Villarreal]]), [[Kamel Ghilas]], [[Stephen Hunt (footballer born 1981)|Stephen Hunt]], [[Paul McShane (Irish footballer)|Paul McShane]], and he also signed [[Ibrahima Sonko]] on transfer deadline day on loan from [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] – after the departure of [[Michael Turner (footballer, born 1983)|Michael Turner]] to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. [[Steven Mouyokolo]] also joined after he was initially purchased on 30 January 2009. Free agent [[Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink]] signed for the Tigers on 3 September 2009.

Brown's position as Hull manager was thought to be under threat in November 2009 following a poor start to the season, however a run of eight points from four games dampened such speculation.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/hull/article7062923.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Rollercoaster ride at Hull for Phil Brown | first=Russell | last=Kempson | date=15 March 2010 | access-date=22 May 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The team's disciplinary problems also continued, with a £40,000 fine levied following a fracas in a 3–0 defeat at Arsenal and Hull also occupying last place in the Fair Play League.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hullcityonline.com/news/tmnw/hull_city_bottom_of_fair_play_league_484676/index.shtml |title= Hull City Bottom of Fair Play League|publisher=Hull City Online |date= 19 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122131826/http://www.hullcityonline.com/news/tmnw/hull_city_bottom_of_fair_play_league_484676/index.shtml|archive-date=22 January 2010|access-date=25 January 2014}}</ref> On 15 March 2010 Brown was put on [[gardening leave]] at Hull after a run of four defeats left the team in the relegation zone.<ref>{{cite news | title =Hull City relieve manager Phil Brown of his duties | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/8567985.stm | publisher = BBC |work = BBC Sport | date =15 March 2010 | access-date = 15 March 2010}}</ref> Hull achieved one win in the last fifteen games under Brown, and a total of five in the 2009–10 league season.
