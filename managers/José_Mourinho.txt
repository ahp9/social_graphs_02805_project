After brief managerial stints at [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and [[U.D.

=== Education ===
Mourinho failed in the subject of [[mathematics]] during the final year of high school, and this prevented him from finishing high school in time to enrol at the physical education college as was his wish. After finishing high school in the special examination period of September, his mother enrolled him in a private business school because there were no vacant seats for him in the physical education college and his mother believed business school would bring him to a more successful [[career path]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mourinho chumbou a Matemática, a mãe mandou-o para Gestão e acabou... em treinador |url=https://www.record.pt/internacional/paises/inglaterra/detalhe/mourinho-chumbou-a-matematica-a-mae-mandou-o-para-gestao-e-acabou-em-treinador |access-date=22 November 2023 |website=www.record.pt |language=pt-PT}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Hughes |date=22 November 2023 |title=It all adds up fine for Mourinho as Chelsea saunter on |newspaper=[[The Times]] |url=https://www.thetimes.com/article/it-all-adds-up-fine-for-mourinho-as-chelsea-saunter-on-k2p5wx2mkrp |access-date=22 November 2023 |issn=0140-0460}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{cite web |title=X-Files José Mourinho: O lado oculto do 'Special One' |url=https://www.cmjornal.pt/domingo/detalhe/x_files_jose_mourinho_o_lado_oculto_do_special_one |access-date=22 November 2023 |website=cmjornal.pt |date=5 June 2016 |language=pt-PT}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Fazer o curso com uma perna às costas |url=https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/fazer-o-curso-com-uma-perna-as-costas |access-date=22 November 2023 |website=Maisfutebol |language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Fazer o curso com uma perna às costas |url=https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/fazer-o-curso-com-uma-perna-as-costas |access-date=25 November 2023 |website=maisfutebol.iol.pt}}</ref> Mourinho dropped out of business school on his first day, deciding he would rather focus on sport, and chose to attend the Instituto Superior de Educação Física (ISEF) of the [[Technical University of Lisbon]] to study [[physical education]].<ref name="Sitting" /><ref>{{cite web |title=José Mourinho prevê "mais 10 ou 15 anos" de carreira e diz que "fez os mais novos sonharem" |url=https://www.record.pt/internacional/paises/inglaterra/tottenham/detalhe/jose-mourinho-preve-mais-10-ou-15-anos-de-carreira-e-diz-que-fez-os-mais-novos-sonharem |access-date=26 November 2023 |website=www.record.pt |language=pt-PT}}</ref> He was taught there by his mentor [[Manuel Sérgio]], the ex-chairman and deputy director of Belenenses (1975–77), whose [[Humanism|humanist]] approach to [[kinesiology]] he later cited as formative.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mourinho devia ser o próximo treinador do Benfica, defende Manuel Sérgio |work=[[Público (Portugal)]] |date=27 March 2008 |access-date=27 August 2025 |url=https://www.publico.pt/2008/03/27/desporto/noticia/mourinho-devia-ser-o-proximo-treinador-do-benfica-defende-manuel-sergio-1323856 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250826235715/https://www.publico.pt/2008/03/27/desporto/noticia/mourinho-devia-ser-o-proximo-treinador-do-benfica-defende-manuel-sergio-1323856 |archive-date=26 August 2025 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Manuel Sérgio apresenta Conferência "Desporto e Motricidade Humana" |work=[[Loulé|Loulé Municipal Chamber]] |date=2 August 2013 |access-date=27 August 2025 |url=https://www.cm-loule.pt/noticias/5333/manuel-sergio-apresenta-conferencia-%E2%80%9Cdesporto-e-motricidade-humana%E2%80%9D.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250826235821/https://www.cm-loule.pt/noticias/5333/manuel-sergio-apresenta-conferencia-%E2%80%9Cdesporto-e-motricidade-humana%E2%80%9D.aspx |archive-date=26 August 2025 |url-status=live}}</ref> After Mourinho concluded his education in ISEF, he attended coaching courses held by the [[The Football Association|English]] and [[Scottish Football Association|Scottish]] Football Associations.<ref name=":4" /> In this period of his life, former [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] manager [[Andy Roxburgh]] took note of the young Portuguese's drive and attention to detail.<ref name=Feature /> Mourinho sought to redefine the role of coach in football by mixing coaching theory with motivational and psychological techniques.<ref name=Statesman />

Mourinho wanted to follow in his father's footsteps and joined the Belenenses youth team.

Mourinho began discussing tactics and coaching with Robson in his interpreting role.<ref name=JoseWay /> Robson was sacked by the club in December 1993. When [[FC Porto|Porto]] appointed him as their head coach, Mourinho moved with him, continuing to coach and interpret for players at the new club.<ref name=Feature /> The Porto team, consisting of players like [[Ljubinko Drulović]], [[Domingos Paciência|Domingos]], [[Rui Barros]], [[Jorge Costa (footballer)|Jorge Costa]] and [[Vítor Baía]], went on to dominate Portuguese football the following years. With Robson as head coach and Mourinho as his assistant, Porto reached the [[1993–94 UEFA Champions League]] semi-finals and won the [[1993–94 Taça de Portugal]], the [[1994–95 Primeira Liga|1994–95]] and [[1995–96 Primeira Liga|1995–96]] [[List of Portuguese football champions|Portuguese championship]], and the 1994, 1995 and 1996 [[Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira|Portuguese Super Cup]], the latter with a [[1996 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira|5–0 victory]] over [[O Clássico|arch-rivals]] [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], in what proved to be Robson's last game at Porto, earning Robson the nickname "Bobby Five-O" in Portugal.

==Managerial career==

===Benfica===
The chance to become a top-tier manager arrived in September 2000 when Mourinho was appointed as the replacement for [[S.L.

Only weeks after being given the job at Benfica, Mourinho's mentor, Bobby Robson, offered him the assistant manager's role at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. Such was Robson's desperation for Mourinho to join him he offered to step down after two years in charge and hand over the reins to Mourinho.

Mourinho guided the team to third place that year after a strong 15-game run (including 11 wins) and gave the promise of "making Porto champions next year".

He quickly identified several key players as the backbone of what he believed would be a perfect Porto team: Vítor Baía, [[Ricardo Carvalho]], [[Costinha]], [[Deco]], [[Dmitri Alenichev]] and [[Hélder Postiga]]. He recalled captain Jorge Costa after a six-month loan to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].

In 2003, Mourinho won his first [[2002–03 Primeira Liga|Primeira Liga]] with a 27–5–2 record, 11 points clear of Benfica, the team he quit two years earlier. The total of 86 points out of the possible maximum of 102 was a Portuguese record, until the [[2015–16 Primeira Liga|2015–16 season]] won by Benfica (88 points), since the rule of three points per win was introduced. Mourinho also won the [[2002–03 Taça de Portugal|Taça de Portugal]], beating former club Leiria in the [[2003 Taça de Portugal Final|final]], and the [[2003 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup final]] against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], both in May 2003.

They secured the title five weeks before the end of the season. Porto lost the [[2004 Taça de Portugal Final]] to Benfica in May 2004, but two weeks later, Mourinho won a greater prize: the [[2003–04 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], with a [[2004 UEFA Champions League Final|3–0 win]] over [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in Germany.

Liverpool offered their managerial position to [[Rafael Benítez]], and Mourinho instead accepted a large offer from Roman Abramovich and pledged his immediate future to Chelsea.<ref name=LivMove />

===Chelsea===
On 2 June 2004, Mourinho moved to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on a three-year contract, after a £1.7&nbsp;million compensation package was agreed with Porto, making him the first Portuguese manager in the Premier League.<ref name=PortoEnd>{{cite news |title=Chelsea appoint Mourinho |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3765263.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=2 June 2004 |access-date=10 June 2016 |archive-date=12 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112084128/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3765263.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> In a press conference upon joining the English side, Mourinho spoke on Chelsea's credentials, stating: "We have top players and, sorry if I'm arrogant, we have a top manager", before adding,

He retained [[Steve Clarke]], a long-serving former player at Chelsea, who had also performed an assistant managerial-type role under previous managers at the club. In terms of spending, Mourinho carried on where his predecessor [[Claudio Ranieri]] left off, as, bankrolled by Roman Abramovich, he spent in excess of £70&nbsp;million in transfer fees on players such as [[Tiago Mendes|Tiago]] (£10&nbsp;million), [[Michael Essien]] (£24.4&nbsp;million), [[Didier Drogba]] (£24&nbsp;million), [[Mateja Kežman]] (£5.4&nbsp;million), Ricardo Carvalho (£19.8&nbsp;million) and Paulo Ferreira (£13.3&nbsp;million).

====2004–06: First trophies in England====
Under Mourinho, Chelsea built on the potential developed in the previous season. By early December, they were at the top of the [[2004–05 FA Premier League|Premier League]] table and had reached the knock-out stages of the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. He secured his first trophy by winning the [[2004–05 Football League Cup|League Cup]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] [[2005 Football League Cup Final|3–2]] ([[Extra time#Association football|AET]]) in [[Cardiff]]. Towards the end of the match, Mourinho was escorted from the touchline after putting his finger to his mouth in the direction of Liverpool fans, as a response to taunts directed towards him whilst Liverpool were leading.

Chelsea met Barcelona in the Champions League round of 16, a highly contested match where the Blues lost away in the first leg 2–1 but advanced on aggregate, winning at home 4–2. In the quarter-finals against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Mourinho who was banned from attending the stadium, waited in the dressing room before the match to talk to his players, then he hid in a laundry basket to leave the stadium.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/11612678/jose-mourinho-explains-how-he-hid-in-laundry-basket-to-escape-ban-while-at-chelsea |title=Jose Mourinho explains how he hid in laundry basket to escape ban while at Chelsea |website=Sky Sports |date=20 January 2019 |access-date=31 January 2021 |archive-date=30 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210830144318/https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11668/11612678/jose-mourinho-explains-how-he-hid-in-laundry-basket-to-escape-ban-while-at-chelsea |url-status=live }}</ref> Chelsea were knocked out of the competition by a controversial goal in the semi-finals by eventual winners Liverpool.<ref>{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Nick |title=Motion expert says Garcia's shot did cross |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |page=77|date=5 May 2005}}</ref> Under Mourinho, Chelsea secured their first [[List of English football champions|top-flight domestic title]] in 50 years, setting a string of [[Football records in England|English football records]] in the process, including the most points ever achieved in the Premier League (95) and the fewest goals conceded (15).

Chelsea started the next season well: they defeated [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 2–1 to win the [[2005 FA Community Shield]] and topped the Premier League from the first weekend of the [[2005–06 FA Premier League|2005–06]] season. Chelsea beat rivals Manchester United 3–0 to win their second consecutive Premier League title and Mourinho's fourth domestic title in a row. After the presentation of his championship medal, Mourinho threw Robert Huth's into the crowd. Mourinho was awarded a second medal for Huth within minutes, which he also threw into the crowd.<ref>{{cite web |date=9 June 2024 |title=Jose Mourinho: Chelsea boss actually threw player's medal into crowd |url=https://onefootball.com/en/news/jose-mourinho-chelsea-boss-actually-threw-players-medal-into-crowd-35922343 |access-date=9 June 2024 |website=OneFootball }}</ref>

====2006–07: Continued domestic success====
The [[2006–07 Chelsea F.C. season|2006–07 season]] saw growing media speculation that Mourinho would leave the club at the season's conclusion due to alleged poor relations with owner Roman Abramovich and a power struggle with sporting director [[Frank Arnesen]] and Abramovich advisor [[Piet de Visser (football manager)|Piet de Visser]]. Mourinho later cleared doubts regarding his future at Stamford Bridge, stating that there would only be two ways for him to leave Chelsea: if Chelsea did not offer him a new contract before the expiry of his current deal in June 2010, or if Chelsea were to sack him.<ref>{{cite web |date=24 February 2007 |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/NewsHomePage/0,,10268~986873,00.html |title=Jose:Respect for fans; Respect for Carling Cup |publisher=[[Chelsea FC]] |access-date=24 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403194024/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/NewsHomePage/0%2C%2C10268~986873%2C00.html |archive-date=3 April 2007}}</ref>

[[File:JoseMourinho.jpg|thumb|upright|Mourinho with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2007]]

Didier Drogba had the highest scoring season of his career that year and this led to his newly signed strike partner [[Andrey Shevchenko]] to be dropped from the starting line-up towards the end of the season by Mourinho. Notably, in the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] semi-final match against Liverpool at [[Anfield]], Shevchenko was not even included on the bench. The other high-profile arrival besides Shevchenko was German captain [[Michael Ballack]], a free agent from [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] who was signed to strengthen the midfield. The Icelandic striker [[Eiður Guðjohnsen]] departed the club for Barcelona.

Despite the unrest, Chelsea won the [[2006–07 Football League Cup|League Cup]] again by defeating Arsenal at the [[Millennium Stadium]]. The possibility of the quadruple was brought to an end on 1 May 2007 when Liverpool eliminated Chelsea from the Champions League on penalties at Anfield, following a 1–1 aggregate draw. Days later, Chelsea drew 1–1 with Arsenal at the [[Emirates Stadium|Emirates]], which secured the Premier League title for Manchester United. This was Mourinho's first season without a league title win in five years. Mourinho led Chelsea to a 1–0 victory against Manchester United in the [[2007 FA Cup Final]], winning in the first final to be played at the rebuilt [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]]. This was his first FA Cup win which meant that he had won every domestic trophy available to a Premier League manager.

There was to be further friction between Mourinho and Abramovich when [[Avram Grant]] was appointed as director of football, despite objections from Mourinho. Grant's position was further enhanced by being given a seat on the board. In spite of these tensions, the 2007–08 transfer season would see the departure of Dutch winger [[Arjen Robben]] to Real Madrid and the arrival of French midfielder [[Florent Malouda]] from Lyon.

====2007–08: Departure====
In the first match of the [[2007–08 Premier League|2007–08 season]], Chelsea beat [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 3–2 to set a new record of 64 consecutive home league matches without defeat. Despite surpassing the record set by Liverpool between 1978 and 1981,<ref name=Unbeaten>{{cite news |title=Mourinho thrilled to break record |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=12 August 2007 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/6943246.stm |access-date=20 October 2008 |archive-date=18 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918135114/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/6943246.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> the start to the [[2007–08 Chelsea F.C. season|2007–08 season]] was less successful than previous starts. The team lost at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and followed this with a goalless draw at home to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. Their opening game in the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] saw them only manage a 1–1 home draw against the Norwegian team [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] in front of only 24,973 (an almost half-empty stadium), which included an unimpressed owner Roman Abramovich.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chelsea 1–1 Rosenborg |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6996403.stm |work=BBC Sport |access-date=28 August 2018 |archive-date=22 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422204916/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6996403.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Mourinho unexpectedly left Chelsea on 20 September 2007 "by mutual consent", although there had been a series of disagreements with owner Abramovich.<ref name="chelsea exit" /> The Chelsea board held an emergency meeting and decided it was time to part with their manager. Mourinho left as the most successful manager in Chelsea's history, having won six trophies for the club in three years. He was also undefeated in all home league games.

===Inter Milan===
On 2 June 2008, Mourinho was appointed the successor of [[Roberto Mancini]] at [[Inter Milan]] on a three-year contract and brought along with him much of his backroom staff who had served him at both Chelsea and Porto.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inter.it/aas/news/reader?N=29399&L=en |title=Josè Mourinho joins Inter |publisher=Inter Milan |access-date=2 June 2008 |archive-date=12 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512092530/http://www.inter.it/aas/news/reader?N=29399&L=en |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3641015,00.html |title=Inter confirm Mourinho |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |access-date=2 June 2008 |archive-date=21 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021121643/http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3641015,00.html |url-status=live }}</ref> He chose [[Giuseppe Baresi]], a former Inter player and ex-head coach of their youth academy, as his assistant.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/7431480.stm |title=Mourinho takes over as Inter boss |work=[[BBC Sport]] |access-date=2 June 2008 |date=2 June 2008 |archive-date=27 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190127012104/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/7431480.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> He spoke solely in [[Italian language|Italian]] in his first press conference as Inter boss, claiming to have learnt it "in three weeks".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Primo_Piano/2008/06_Giugno/03/mourinho.shtml |publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=it |title=E' subito Mourinho-show.

====2008–09: First Serie A title====
[[File:Mourinho in Moscow.jpg|thumb|upright|Mourinho as [[Inter Milan]] manager in 2008]]

In his first season as Inter head coach, Mourinho won the [[2008 Supercoppa Italiana|Supercoppa Italiana]], beating [[A.S.

Inter were eliminated 2–0 on aggregate by Manchester United in the first knock-out round of the [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], and he also failed to win the [[2008–09 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], losing 3–1 on aggregate to [[U.C.

Both teenagers played a part in the ''[[List of Italian football champions|Scudetto]]''-winning season and played enough games to earn their first senior trophy.

Despite his domestic successes in winning the ''Scudetto'' by a 10-point margin, Mourinho's first season in Italy was viewed as disappointing by some Inter fans, as the club failed to improve on the performances of his predecessor Roberto Mancini in the Champions League. Inter put in a series of lacklustre group stage performances that included a shock 1–0 home loss to [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] and an away draw with Cypriot minnows [[Anorthosis Famagusta F.C.|Anorthosis Famagusta]]. Inter qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League but failed to make it to the quarter-finals after being defeated by Manchester United.

On 16 May 2009, Inter mathematically won the Serie A title after runners-up Milan lost to [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]]. This loss left the ''Nerazzurri'' seven points above their crosstown rivals with only two games remaining. They would eventually finish 10 points clear of Milan.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/feedarticle/8511149 |work=The Guardian |date=16 May 2009 |title=Inter land Serie A title after Milan lose |access-date=16 May 2009 |location=London |archive-date=31 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231145848/http://www.theguardian.com/football/feedarticle/8511149 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====2009–10: Final season in Italy and historic treble====
On 28 July 2009, Mourinho was reported to have shown interest in taking over at Manchester United when Alex Ferguson retired. He was quoted as saying, "I would consider going to Manchester United but United have to consider if they want me to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson. If they do, then of course."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/united-appeals-to-mourinho-6797712.html|title=United appeals to Mourinho|work=Evening Standard|date=12 April 2012|access-date=25 August 2022|archive-date=25 August 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220825164548/https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/united-appeals-to-mourinho-6797712.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Adriano (footballer, born February 1982)|Adriano]] left Inter in April 2009, and the exit of the Brazilian striker was followed by the Argentine duo [[Julio Ricardo Cruz|Julio Cruz]] and [[Hernán Crespo]]. Legendary Portuguese attacking midfielder and veteran [[Luís Figo]] retired. Figo was on the verge of leaving Inter under Mancini due to a lack of playing time, but in his final season Mourinho used him frequently. Mourinho signed Argentine striker [[Diego Milito]], who fell just one goal short of winning the top scorer award with [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], as well as [[Thiago Motta]] and [[Wesley Sneijder]], to bolster the midfield. Perhaps his most notable signing of the summer of his second season was a swap deal of [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]] in exchange for Barcelona's Cameroonian striker [[Samuel Eto'o]] and a reported £35&nbsp;million. This transfer was the second most expensive in the history of the transfer market, after [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid earlier in the summer. Eto'o got off to a promising start with Inter by scoring two goals in the first two matches of the season.

Ricardo Quaresma's signing from Mourinho's old club Porto was viewed as providing a previously missing link in the Inter squad, but his play disappointed the club and led him to be loaned out to Chelsea midway through the season, ironically Mourinho's other former club. Mancini also failed to dominate in the midfield and addressing these shortcomings in the transfer market became a priority for Inter. Inter's lack of a creative playmaker, or ''trequartista'', had been blamed for the Champions League failure. In an attempt to deal with this issue, Inter signed Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder from Real Madrid.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/6080045/European-Round-up-Samuel-Etoo-scores-on-Inter-Milan-debut.html |title=European Round-up: Samuel Eto'o scores on Inter Milan debut |date=24 August 2009 |work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=13 February 2016 |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109011003/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/6080045/European-Round-up-Samuel-Etoo-scores-on-Inter-Milan-debut.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Inter struggled in their first two matches of the new season. The team lost the [[2009 Supercoppa Italiana|Supercoppa]] to Lazio 2–1 and drew 1–1 with newly promoted [[A.S. Bari|Bari]] at the [[San Siro]]. Mourinho's team improved dramatically after that, as he built a formidable midfield with Sneijder at the heart of it and the likes of new signing Thiago Motta and veterans [[Javier Zanetti]] and [[Dejan Stanković]]. Inter went on to score more than 30 goals before the end of November, thrashing [[Derby della Madonnina|derby rivals]] Milan 4–0, with new signings Diego Milito and Motta both scoring, and hammering Genoa 5–0, the largest margin of victory in the Serie A that season. Mourinho was sent off in the December ''[[Derby d'Italia]]'' away fixture after he sarcastically applauded the referee for what he felt was a dubious free-kick given to Juventus and Inter went on to lose 2–1, courtesy of a [[Claudio Marchisio]] winner in the second half.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jose Mourinho sent off as Inter Milan are defeated by Juventus |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/dec/05/europeanfootball-internazionale |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=5 December 2009 |location=London |access-date=7 May 2010 |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109011015/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/dec/05/europeanfootball-internazionale |url-status=live }}</ref>

Mourinho achieved what was hailed as one of his career highlights after Inter managed to progress to the [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] quarter-finals by defeating his former team Chelsea in both legs (2–1 win at San Siro, then followed by a 1–0 win at Stamford Bridge).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8568613.stm |work=BBC Sport |access-date=16 March 2010 |date=16 March 2010 |title=Chelsea 0–1 Inter Milan (agg 1–3) |archive-date=1 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801200306/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8568613.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> His difficult relationship with young striker Mario Balotelli and the team's loss of form that led Inter to achieve only seven points in six games (with three of those games, including a shock 1–3 defeat at the hands of Sicilian minnows [[Catania S.S.D.|Catania]], happening during Mourinho's ban) were heavily criticised by the media and pundits.

On 6 April 2010, Mourinho became the first manager in history to take three teams to the semi-finals of the Champions League (this record was equalled by Bayern Munich manager Louis van Gaal a day later) after Inter managed to overcome a 1–0 defeat to [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]] in Russia in the second leg of their quarter-final tie, which ended 2–0 on aggregate, with Wesley Sneijder's goal in the sixth minute proving decisive.

Prior to Mourinho's arrival, Real Madrid had underperformed, despite paying record transfer fees for ''Galácticos'' such as [[Kaká]] and Cristiano Ronaldo. Their [[2009–10 Real Madrid CF season|2009–10 season]] was marked by disappointments such as ''[[Alcorconazo]]'', a shock [[2009–10 Copa del Rey]] round of 32 defeat to [[Segunda División B]] team [[AD Alcorcón|Alcorcón]], and elimination from the Champions League by Lyon in the round of 16, though they finished second in [[2009–10 La Liga|La Liga]] with a club record 96 points.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> By the end of the transfer window, after the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], Mourinho had brought four new players to the squad: the Germans [[Sami Khedira]] (€13&nbsp;million) and [[Mesut Özil]] (€15&nbsp;million), Portuguese defender [[Ricardo Carvalho]] (€8&nbsp;million) and Argentine winger [[Ángel Di María]] (€25&nbsp;million plus €11&nbsp;million on incentives).

According to ''[[Corriere dello Sport]]'', the relationship between Mourinho and Roma directors had turned frosty as the two parties had different views on the club's future, with Mourinho becoming increasingly frustrated over a lack of financial backing at Roma, due to the club's Financial Fair Play restrictions, leading to some disagreements over potential transfers, as he wanted reassurances from the Roma owners before committing his future to the club, amid reports that Mourinho was in advance negotiations to become Paris Saint-Germain's new manager.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mourinho-Roma relationship turns frosty but fans still hope|url=https://football-italia.net/mourinho-roma-relationship-turns-frosty-but-fans-still-hope/|access-date=26 May 2023|work=Football Italia|date=24 May 2023|archive-date=26 May 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230526021213/https://football-italia.net/mourinho-roma-relationship-turns-frosty-but-fans-still-hope/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== 2023–24: Struggles and fourth consecutive early departure====
In his [[2023–24 AS Roma season|third season]], due to Roma's limited transfer budget due to Financial Fair Play regulations, following the same transfer policy as the previous season, various players were signed on free transfers or loans, including Argentine midfielder  [[Leandro Paredes]] and [[Renato Sanches]] from Paris Saint-Germain, [[Houssem Aouar]] and [[Evan Ndicka]] on free transfers, and the loan of Romelu Lukaku from Chelsea, whom Mourinho had previously managed at Manchester United.

After enduring a difficult start to the season, with the club near the relegation zone, on 17 September, Mourinho registered the biggest win in Serie A since April 1961, when Roma thrashed [[Empoli FC|Empoli]] 7–0 at home.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/roma-7-0-empoli-jose-215048393.html |title=Roma 7–0 Empoli: Jose Mourinho's side equal modern Serie A record in rout |website=BBC News |date=17 September 2023 |access-date=17 September 2023 |archive-date=28 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230928204647/https://sports.yahoo.com/roma-7-0-empoli-jose-215048393.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Teams under Mourinho's management typically demonstrate great defensive awareness as well as a quick transition ability with the ball through midfield, in particular down the flanks. A common feature of his teams is playing with three or more central midfielders, as Mourinho has stressed midfield superiority as crucial in winning games. As a Porto manager, Mourinho employed a diamond [[Formation (association football)#4–4–2|4–4–2]] formation, with his midfield – consisting of [[Costinha]] or [[Pedro Mendes (footballer, born 1979)|Pedro Mendes]] as defensive midfielder; Maniche and Dmitri Alenichev as wide central midfielders; and Deco on the tip – acting as a cohesive unit rather than a collection of individuals,<ref name="zonalmarking.net">{{cite web |url=http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/08/teams-of-the-decade-3-porto-2002-04/ |title=Teams of the Decade #4: Porto, 2002–04 |website=Zonalmarking.net |date=8 March 2010 |access-date=28 May 2016 |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109010959/http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/08/teams-of-the-decade-3-porto-2002-04/ |url-status=live }}</ref> providing Porto with midfield superiority while allowing the full-backs to move forward.<ref name="zonalmarking.net" /> Defensively, the team played with a high defensive line and were known for their fitness and use of heavy pressing high up the pitch.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com.au/football/insider/story/_/id/40241743/will-portos-unlikely-champions-league-win-ever-repeated |title=Will Porto's unlikely Champions League win ever be repeated? |work=ESPN.com |date=30 May 2024 |access-date=13 June 2024 }}</ref>

During his first two years at Chelsea, Mourinho employed a fluid [[Formation (association football)#4–3–3|4–3–3]] formation, having [[Claude Makélélé]] play the role of deep-lying midfielder. This gave Chelsea a three-against-two midfield advantage over most English teams playing 4–4–2 at the time, and helped Chelsea win Premier League titles in 2004–05 and 2005–06. Mourinho explained:

<blockquote>Look, if I have a triangle in midfield – Claude Makélélé behind and two others just in front – I will always have an advantage against a pure 4–4–2 where the central midfielders are side by side. That's because I will always have an extra man. It starts with Makelele, who is between the lines. If nobody comes to him he can see the whole pitch and has time. If he gets closed down it means one of the two other central midfielders is open.

Mourinho is also renowned for always being well-informed about his next opponent and tactically outwitting other managers in games. In a [[2003–04 UEFA Champions League|2004 Champions League]] knockout stage home game between Porto and Alex Ferguson's Manchester United, Mourinho had already asserted that United's weakness was on the flanks, especially on the left where [[Quinton Fortune]] was protected by [[Ryan Giggs]]. The central pairing of Maniche and Deco targeted that flank with their threaded passes, and Dmitri Alenichev wreaked havoc. He set up [[Benny McCarthy]]'s equaliser in the first half, then with United focussed on defending the left, Porto switched to the other side, where McCarthy was able to beat [[Gary Neville]] and [[Wes Brown]] to score the winner.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sharemytactics.com/60988/ |title=Porto (4–1–3–2) vs Manchester United (4–2–4–0) – UEFA Champions League – 26th February 2004 – Football tactics and formations |website=ShareMyTactics.com |date=7 February 2016 |access-date=28 May 2016 |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109011033/http://sharemytactics.com/60988/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sharemytactics.com/60992/ |title=Porto (4–2–3–1) vs Manchester United (4–2–4–0) – UEFA Champions League – 26th February 2004 – Football tactics and formations |website=ShareMyTactics.com |date=7 February 2016 |access-date=28 May 2016 |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109011036/http://sharemytactics.com/60992/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Mourinho is also acknowledged for his attention to detail, organisational planning and in-game communication. In a [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|2013–14 Champions League]] knockout game against Paris Saint-Germain, when Chelsea needed one goal within 10 minutes to progress, he played a risky 4–1–2–3 in the last quarter, which led to [[Demba Ba]]'s winning goal. After the game, Mourinho said that his team had worked excessively on three alternative formations in training:

<blockquote>We trained yesterday with the three different systems we used, the one we started with, the one without [Frank] [[Frank Lampard|Lampard]] and finally the one with Demba and [[Fernando Torres|Fernando]] [Torres] in, and the players knew what to do.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web |url=http://www.zonalmarking.net/2014/04/09/chelsea-2-0-psg-mourinho-takes-risks-late-on/ |title=Chelsea 2–0 PSG: Mourinho takes risks late on |website=Zonalmarking.net |date=9 April 2014 |access-date=28 May 2016 |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109011029/http://www.zonalmarking.net/2014/04/09/chelsea-2-0-psg-mourinho-takes-risks-late-on/ |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>

When Ba hit the winner, Mourinho darted down the touchline "in celebration", but afterwards he said he was primarily running to tell Torres and Ba their positional instructions for the remaining six minutes of the contest.<ref name="ReferenceB" />

On 16 April 2017, Mourinho's Manchester United beat league leaders Chelsea 2–0.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/match/14362|title=Manchester United v Chelsea, 2016/17 |website=www.premierleague.com|access-date=17 April 2017|archive-date=25 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425044821/https://www.premierleague.com/match/14362|url-status=live}}</ref> During the game, Mourinho instructed Ander Herrera to man-mark Eden Hazard. This tactic proved effective as Hazard, and Chelsea, were nullified for large portions of the game. A previously untested strike partnership of [[Marcus Rashford]] and [[Jesse Lingard]] also caused the Chelsea defence problems, with the former opening the scoring in the 7th minute. Mourinho's tactical organisation throughout the match drew praise within the footballing world.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39617552 |title=Man Utd 2–0 Chelsea: A Jose Mourinho masterclass with a twist |date=16 April 2017 |work=BBC Sport |access-date=17 April 2017 |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109011114/https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/39617552 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Media attention and controversies==
===Chelsea===
[[File:Wengerglare.jpg|thumb|[[Arsène Wenger]] (red tie) and Mourinho (middle). Wenger was among the coaches with whom Mourinho has had confrontations.]]

Following a Champions League tie between Chelsea and Barcelona in March 2005, Mourinho accused referee [[Anders Frisk]] and Barcelona coach [[Frank Rijkaard]] of breaking [[FIFA]] rules by having a meeting at half-time. Mourinho said that this biased the referee and caused him to send off Chelsea striker Didier Drogba in the second half.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mourinho accuses Barca's Rijkaard |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=27 February 2005 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4283843.stm |access-date=20 October 2008 |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109011026/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4283843.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> Frisk stated that Rijkaard had tried to speak to him but said that he had sent him away.<ref>{{cite news |title=Uefa: Rijkaard did approach Frisk |work=The Guardian |date=7 April 2005 |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,5165760-103,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629234830/http://football.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,5165760-103,00.html |archive-date=29 June 2012 |access-date=20 October 2008 |location=London |url-status=dead}}</ref> The situation intensified when Frisk began to receive death threats from angered fans, causing the referee to retire prematurely.<ref>{{cite web |title=Anders Frisk hangs up his whistle |publisher=[[FIFA]] |date=14 March 2005 |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/developing/refereeing/news/newsid=96674.html |access-date=20 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508202146/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/developing/refereeing/news/newsid%3D96674.html |archive-date=8 May 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> UEFA referees chief [[Volker Roth]] labelled Mourinho an "enemy of football",<ref>{{cite news |title=Mourinho accused as Frisk quits |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=14 March 2005 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/4346509.stm |access-date=20 October 2008 |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109011050/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/4346509.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> although UEFA distanced themselves from the comment.<ref>{{cite web |title=Uefa Steer Clear of Roth Remarks |work=Sporting Life |date=17 March 2005 |url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/premiership/chelsea/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/05/03/17/manual_074530.html&TEAMHD=chelsea |access-date=20 October 2008 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184023/http://www.sportinglife.com/football/premiership/chelsea/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer%2F05%2F03%2F17%2Fmanual_074530.html&TEAMHD=chelsea |url-status=live }}</ref> After an investigation of the incident, Mourinho was given a two-match touchline ban for his behaviour and both Chelsea and the manager were fined by UEFA, though the body confirmed that it did not hold Mourinho personally responsible for Frisk's retirement.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chelsea fined, Mourinho banned over Frisk affair |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=1 April 2005 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Football/Chelsea-fined-Mourinho-banned-over-Frisk-affair/2005/04/01/1111862543135.html |access-date=20 October 2008 |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109011057/https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/chelsea-fined-mourinho-banned-over-frisk-affair-20050401-gdl1jk.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mourinho cleared of forcing Frisk out |work=Sporting Life |date=17 March 2005 |url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/premiership/chelsea/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/05/03/17/SOCCER_Chelsea_Nightlead.html&TEAMHD=chelsea |access-date=20 October 2008 |archive-date=13 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113032900/http://www.sportinglife.com/football/premiership/chelsea/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer%2F05%2F03%2F17%2FSOCCER_Chelsea_Nightlead.html&TEAMHD=chelsea |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 2 June 2005, Mourinho was fined £200,000 for his part in the meeting with then Arsenal full-back [[Ashley Cole]] in January of that year. The pair had met to discuss transfer terms while Cole was still under contract to Arsenal, which was in breach of the Premier League rules. His fine was later reduced to £75,000 after a hearing in August.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mourinho & Cole lose fine appeals |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=10 August 2005 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4137124.stm |access-date=20 October 2008 |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109011058/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4137124.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> Later that year, he labelled Arsenal manager [[Arsène Wenger]] "a voyeur" after being irked at what he saw as the latter's apparent obsession with Chelsea.

===Inter Milan===
====Presentation====
On 3 June 2008, during the press conference introducing him as new Inter manager, Mourinho spoke almost perfect Italian. When asked about how he would see players like [[Frank Lampard]] or [[Michael Essien]] in Italian [[Serie A]], Mourinho realised that this was a way of making him speak about [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] players, something he had refused to do in previous questions. Consequently, he replied "{{lang|it|Ma io non sono pirla!|i=no}}" ([[Milan]]se Italian for "I'm not stupid!").<ref name="Citazioni Mou">{{cite web|url=https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Premier-League/17-12-2015/mourinho-10-frasi-celebri-special-one-zero-tituli-monaco-nemici-1301324593746.shtml|title=Mourinho, le 10 frasi celebri: Special One, zero tituli, Lo Monaco e i nemici|year=2015|language=Italian|access-date=13 October 2021|archive-date=28 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028173015/https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Premier-League/17-12-2015/mourinho-10-frasi-celebri-special-one-zero-tituli-monaco-nemici-1301324593746.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sport.sky.it/calcio/serie-a/2018/06/03/mourinho-io-non-sono-pirla-3-giugno-2008-inter-storia-|title=3 giugno 2008, è il "Pirla-day": parola di José Mourinho|date=3 June 2018|language=Italian|access-date=13 October 2021|archive-date=27 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211027182906/https://sport.sky.it/calcio/serie-a/2018/06/03/mourinho-io-non-sono-pirla-3-giugno-2008-inter-storia-|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Lo Monaco comments====
After Inter defeated [[Catania S.S.D.|Catania]] 2–1 on 13 September 2008, the opponents' CEO Pietro Lo Monaco resented the fact that Mourinho had underlined Inter's superiority in the match, especially by saying that he could have played in goal for Inter. Lo Monaco stated: "Mourinho andrebbe preso a bastonate sui denti" (Italian for "Mourinho should be beaten on his teeth"). Lo Monaco later clarified that he did not mean to encourage violence, but that it was just a way of saying that Mourinho should shut up. When asked about Lo Monaco's statements, Mourinho replied that he did not know him, saying that he only knew other Monacos such as [[Monaco|the principality]], or [[Bayern Munich]], known in Italy as Bayern Monaco.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sport.sky.it/calcio/2008/09/15/risposta_mourinho_a_lo_monaco|title=Mourinho: Lo Monaco chi?

====Comparison with Mancini====
On 9 November 2008, after Inter defeated Udinese 1–0 via a late [[Julio Ricardo Cruz]] goal,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/it/news/2/serie-a/2008/11/09/955979/inter-udinese-1-0-chiamatela-zona-mourinho-cruz-fa-esplodere-san-|title=Inter-Udinese 1–0: Chiamatela zona Mourinho, Cruz fa esplodere San Siro al minuto 92!|language=Italian|access-date=17 October 2021|archive-date=17 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211017192231/https://www.goal.com/it/news/2/serie-a/2008/11/09/955979/inter-udinese-1-0-chiamatela-zona-mourinho-cruz-fa-esplodere-san-|url-status=live}}</ref> Mourinho had a discussion with the journalist [[Mario Sconcerti]]. As the Portuguese manager had underlined on the day before that he was collecting more points during his first [[Serie A]] campaign with Inter compared to [[Roberto Mancini]]'s first season, basically with the aim of defending his work, which media considered below expectations, Sconcerti invited Mourinho to avoid comparisons with the Italian manager, who could not respond directly. An annoyed Mourinho replied to Sconcerti asking for honest comparisons and emphasising once again that he was doing better than Mancini.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.quotidiano.net/sport/2008/11/09/131366-mourinho_litiga_giornalista.shtml/amp|title=Mourinho litiga con un giornalista di Sky e abbandona le telecamere della Rai|date=9 November 2008|language=Italian|access-date=17 October 2021|archive-date=17 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211017192229/https://www.quotidiano.net/sport/2008/11/09/131366-mourinho_litiga_giornalista.shtml/amp|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sport.sky.it/calcio/2008/11/09/mourinho_dopo_inter_udinese|title=Mourinho contro tutti: "Le critiche per me valgono zero"|date=9 November 2008|language=Italian|access-date=17 October 2021|archive-date=17 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211017192238/https://sport.sky.it/calcio/2008/11/09/mourinho_dopo_inter_udinese|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Wild celebration against Siena====

====Statement about the 2006 ''Scudetto''====
During the halftime of a January 2009 match against [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]], Mourinho was quoted as saying: "The first ''Scudetto'' was given to you in the secretariat [referencing the controversial [[2005–06 Serie A]] title awarded to third-placed Inter in the aftermath of the ''[[Calciopoli]]'' scandal], the second you won it because there was no one there [to compete against], the third [you won it] at the last minute. You are a shitty team."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2008/10/sezioni/sport/calcio/serie_a/mourinho-sgrida-i-suoi/mourinho-sfogo/mourinho-sfogo.html|title=Quella frase di Mourinho 'Scudetto in segreteria...|work=La Repubblica|language=it|date=22 January 2009|access-date=5 February 2023|archive-date=10 December 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221210162517/https://www.repubblica.it/2008/10/sezioni/sport/calcio/serie_a/mourinho-sgrida-i-suoi/mourinho-sfogo/mourinho-sfogo.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sport.sky.it/calcio/2009/01/22/tifosi_juve_su_forum_mourinho_uno_di_noi|title=Tifosi della Juve scatenati sul web: 'Mourinho uno di noi'|website=Sky Sport|language=it|date=22 January 2009|access-date=5 February 2023|archive-date=10 December 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221210162339/https://sport.sky.it/calcio/2009/01/22/tifosi_juve_su_forum_mourinho_uno_di_noi|url-status=live}}</ref> Although Mourinho justified himself by stating that "[s]ometimes you need to tell lies to stimulate the players, to piss them off", he admitted having said the statement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/it/news/2/serie-a/2009/04/02/1187656/uno-scudetto-in-segreteria-laltro-perchè-soli-mou-ammette-è|title='Uno Scudetto in segreteria, l'altro perché soli...': Mou ammette, è tutto vero!|website=Goal.com|language=it|date=2 April 2009|access-date=23 May 2022}}</ref>

====''Zeru tituli'' conference====
During a press conference on 3 March 2009, Mourinho said that [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] would end the season with no honours and alleged that [[Juventus]] had collected a lot of points thanks to referees' mistakes; he also accused Italian sport journalists of "intellectual prostitution" on their behalf, as they were focusing on a possible mistake regarding a penalty conceded to Inter against Roma instead of talking about the failures of Inter's rivals.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/mourinho-rails-against-intellectual-prostitution-1636683.html |work=The Independent |date=4 March 2009 |title=Mourinho rails against 'intellectual prostitution' |access-date=16 May 2009 |location=London |first=Kieran |last=Daley |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109010936/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/mourinho-rails-against-intellectual-prostitution-1636683.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Citazioni Mou"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.repubblica.it/2008/12/sport/calcio/serie-a/inter/mourinho-polemica-inter/mourinho-polemica-inter.html|title=Mourinho contro tutti: "Questa è prostituzione intellettuale"|language=Italian}}</ref>

His rant promptly became popular in Italy, especially regarding the "zero titles" quote used by Mourinho, and incorrectly pronounced by him as ''zeru tituli'' (in correct Italian it would have been ''zero titoli''), which was later extensively referred to by football journalists in Italy. It also became the title's catchphrase used by fans to celebrate Inter's 17th ''Scudetto'' later that season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.football365.com/gazzetta/0,17033,9404_5336293,00.html |title=Inter Won It in True Chelsea Style... |access-date=21 May 2009 |date=19 May 2009 |work=Football365.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522102807/http://www.football365.com/gazzetta/0%2C17033%2C9404_5336293%2C00.html |archive-date=22 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/may/18/serie-a-inter-jose-mourinho |title=Jose Mourinho makes Ibrahimovic sweat for his goal as Inter celebrate scudetto in style |access-date=21 May 2009 |date=18 May 2009 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Nicky |last=Bandini |archive-date=19 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819040053/https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/may/18/serie-a-inter-jose-mourinho |url-status=live }}</ref> The catchphrase was even used by [[Nike Inc.|Nike]] to present the celebration shirts for Inter's Serie A title.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/inter/?action=read&idnotizia=4754 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604154333/http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/inter/?action=read&idnotizia=4754 |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 June 2009 |title=Anche la Nike celebra il 17esimo titulo |access-date=21 May 2009 |date=21 May 2009 |publisher=TuttoMercatoWeb |language=it}}</ref> After the [[2009 Coppa Italia Final|Coppa Italia final]] in May, fans of Roma's cross-town rivals [[S.S.

During the same press conference, Mourinho also directly attacked Roma manager [[Luciano Spalletti]] and Juventus manager [[Claudio Ranieri]]: the former as he was used to continuously releasing interviews, in contrast with Mourinho, who disliked that in spite of the fact that he was considered good at it; the latter as he rejected Mourinho's claims that his team had taken advantage of referees' mistakes. Mourinho said that the single time Inter benefitted was an offside goal against Siena.<ref name="goal.com"/><ref name="Citazioni Mou"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.corriere.it/sport/09_marzo_03/mourinho_inter_roma_juve_rigore_milan_d2b2870a-07ed-11de-805b-00144f02aabc.shtml|title=Furia Mou contro Ranieri e Spalletti|language=Italian}}</ref>

====Italy national team representatives====
Mourinho once again sparked controversy in the summer with his argument with [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] coach [[Marcello Lippi]]. Lippi predicted that Juventus would win the ''scudetto'' in the [[2009–10 Serie A|2009–10 season]], which Mourinho viewed as a disrespectful statement to Inter coming from a national team manager. Lippi responded by saying that it was just a prediction.<ref>{{cite web|date=19 August 2009|title=Calcio Debate: Was Marcello Lippi Disrespectful Or Is Jose Mourinho Just A Troublemaker?|url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2009/08/19/1448043/calcio-debate-was-marcello-lippi-disrespectful-or-is-jose|website=Goal.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gray|first=David|date=20 August 2009|title=Why Mourinho is raging at Lippi|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/soccer/2009/08/20/why-mourinho-is-raging-at-lippi/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324015032/http://blogs.reuters.com/soccer/2009/08/20/why-mourinho-is-raging-at-lippi/|archive-date=24 March 2011|access-date=24 March 2011|website=Reuters Soccer Blog}}</ref>

After the row with Lippi, he clashed with Italy captain [[Fabio Cannavaro]] over Davide Santon's place in the Inter squad. Cannavaro had said that Santon might have to leave Inter to get regular playing time to gain selection for Italy in the upcoming [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. Mourinho responded by saying that Cannavaro was acting like "a coach, a sporting director or a president".<ref>{{cite web|date=4 September 2009|title=Mourinho hits back at Cannavaro|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/5537339/mourinho-hits-back-at-cannavaro|access-date=5 May 2021|website=Sky Sports}}</ref>

====Incident with Ramazzotti====
After Inter drew 1–1 with [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] on 13 December 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ecodibergamo.it/stories/Sport/106706_atalantina_nello_schieramento_previsto/|title=L'Atalanta ferma l'Inter sull'1–1. Bomber Tiribocchi replica a Milito|date=13 December 2009 |language=Italian}}</ref> Mourinho attacked the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' journalist Andrea Ramazzotti, who was not allowed to stay near Inter bus according to the Portuguese manager. Ramazzotti had obtained the authorization from both Inter and [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] press offices to attend players' interviews in that spot. Allegedly, Mourinho not only insulted the journalist but also grabbed him, thus causing controversy. A lot of colleagues sided with Ramazzotti, defending the general right to report news without fearing to be attacked and considering the incident very serious.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ilsussidiario.net/news/calcio-e-altri-sport/2009/12/14/inter-scontro-mourinho-ramazzotti-cronaca-di-un-pomeriggio-di-follia/55585/|title=Inter / Scontro Mourinho – Ramazzotti: cronaca di un pomeriggio di follia|date=14 December 2009|language=Italian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.repubblica.it/2008/12/sport/calcio/serie-a/inter/mourinho-lite/mourinho-lite.html|title=Mourinho nervoso litiga con giornalista|language=Italian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/altre-notizie/lite-con-ramazzotti-mourinho-deferito-187641|title=Lite con Ramazzotti: Mourinho deferito|language=Italian}}</ref> Subsequently, Inter president [[Massimo Moratti]] phoned Ramazzotti in order to apologise to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blitzquotidiano.it/sport/lite-con-mourinho-moratti-telefona-ad-andrea-ramazzotti-175859/|title=Lite con Mourinho: Moratti telefona ad Andrea Ramazzotti|date=14 December 2009|language=Italian}}</ref> Furthermore, the Federal Prosecutor referred Mourinho "for having said, towards the sports journalist Andrea Ramazzotti, offensive remarks as well as for having grabbed his forearms". Inter was also referred for strict liability.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/it/news/2/serie-a/2010/01/11/1738756/il-caso-ramazzotti-non-passa-inosservato-mourinho-si-becca|title=Il caso Ramazzotti non passa inosservato, Mourinho si becca il deferimento|language=Italian}}</ref>

A few days after, Mourinho confronted the journalists in the press conference preceding the [[Coppa Italia]] match against [[U.S. Livorno 1915|Livorno]]. The Inter manager explained his behaviour and denied he had physically assaulted Ramazzotti, admitting he had said offensive words he was not proud of. In addition, Mourinho admired the solidarity of Ramazzotti's colleagues and said that he was not supposed to apologize in public as the situation had not happened in public, trying to play down the incident itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/altre-notizie/inter-mourinho-sul-problema-con-ramazzotti-183978|title=Inter, Mourinho sul problema con Ramazzotti|language=Italian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcinter1908.it/primo-piano/mourinho-la-mia-verita-su-ramazzotti-insulti-si-ma-niente-spinte-ma-e-una-vicenda-non-pubblica-domani-chance-per-donati-e-stevanovic/|title=Mourinho: "La Mia Verita' Su Ramazzotti.

After two away draws in a row against Parma (1–1 on 10 February 2010) and Napoli (0–0 on 14 February),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/it/news/2/serie-a/2010/02/10/1785299/parma-inter-1-1-mirante-e-bojinov-stoppano-la-corazzata|title=Parma-Inter 1–1: Mirante e Bojinov stoppano la corazzata nerazzurra|language=Italian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inter.it/it/news/2010/02/14/napoli-inter-0-0-un-punto-al-san-paolo.html|title=Napoli-Inter: 0–0, Un Punto Al San Paolo|language=Italian|access-date=22 October 2021|archive-date=22 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211022064741/https://www.inter.it/it/news/2010/02/14/napoli-inter-0-0-un-punto-al-san-paolo.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Mourinho defended Inter's performances, stating that he was satisfied with collecting two more points on the road to the league title, despite those results not being positive themselves. In particular, the Inter manager used some sharp words regarding [[Walter Mazzarri]] and [[Aurelio De Laurentiis]], Napoli's respective manager and president.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://calcio.fanpage.it/quando-mourinho-all-inter-attaccava-mazzarri-e-de-laurentiis-video/|title=Quando Mourinho all'Inter attaccava Mazzarri e De Laurentiis|work=Calcio Fanpage |date=30 May 2013 |language=Italian}}</ref>

====Handcuffs gesture====
During the [[Serie A]] game against Sampdoria on 22 February 2010, which ended in a 0–0 draw, with two Inter players being sent off in the first half, Mourinho was disappointed by [[Paolo Tagliavento]]'s refereeing. At the end of the first half, the Inter manager made a [[handcuffs gesture]] towards a camera which was considered by the [[Italian Football Federation]] as violent and critical of the refereeing performance, and caused a three-game ban against Mourinho.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8529113.stm |work=BBC Sport |access-date=16 March 2010 |date=22 February 2010 |title=Jose Mourinho banned and fined over 'handcuffs' gesture |archive-date=3 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403122559/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8529113.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> Further complaining happened in the second half, when the referee denied Inter a penalty, booking [[Samuel Eto'o]] for diving instead, causing Mourinho to laugh ironically as a sign of complaint. All the supporters in [[San Siro]] sided with Mourinho with a ''[[wikt:pañolada|pañolada]]'', a very unusual form of protest in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sport.sky.it/calcio/2010/02/20/commento_anticipi_25a_giornata_serie_a|title=Inter-Samp 0–0.

====Parames statement====
In February 2010, both Juventus manager [[Claudio Ranieri]] and Napoli equivalent [[Walter Mazzarri]] released some comments critical of Mourinho: the former said that it was too easy to switch from Chelsea under [[Roman Abramovich]] to [[Massimo Moratti]] at Inter; the latter stated that he had won more than Mourinho in proportion. Despite Moratti's decision to order a press blackout for Inter following controversial refereeing decisions, Mourinho managed to reply to those managers through his spokesman Eladio Parames.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tuttonapoli.net/in-evidenza/portavoce-mourinho-mazzarri-a-un-asino-pua-lavorare-ma-non-sara-mai-un-cavallo-di-razza-42548|title=Portavoce Mourinho: "Mazzarri è un asino, può lavorare ma non sarà mai un cavallo di razza"|language=Italian}}</ref>

===Real Madrid===
[[File:Mourinho vs Tito Vilanova.jpg|thumb|Mourinho was lampooned in Spain following the incident where, as Real Madrid coach, he poked then [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] assistant coach [[Tito Vilanova]] in the eye.]]

In a 2010–11 Champions League match at Ajax in November 2010, late in the match when Real Madrid were leading 4–0, two Real Madrid players received late second yellow cards related to time-wasting. The result of this meant they were suspended for the final group match even though Madrid would come first in the group, but would benefit by entering the round of 16 without any accumulated yellow cards. It was suggested after an investigation by UEFA that this was a deliberate ploy under Mourinho's instruction via two players in a substitution. As a result, UEFA charged Mourinho along with the four related players with improper conduct regarding the dismissals.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/mourinho-faces-european-ban-over-late-red-cards-controversy-2143915.html |location=London |work=The Independent |first=Jack |last=Pitt-Brooke |title=Mourinho faces European ban over late red cards controversy |date=26 November 2010 |access-date=29 October 2017 |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109011058/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/mourinho-faces-european-ban-over-late-red-cards-controversy-2143915.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Although Mourinho denied the allegations, he was fined £33,500 and received a one-match Champions League ban.<ref>{{cite news |title=Uefa reduces Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho's ban |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/9244634.stm |work=BBC Sport|access-date=23 May 2015 |date=6 December 2010 |archive-date=23 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423184350/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/9244634.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 17 August 2011, in the final of the [[2011 Supercopa de España]], Mourinho was seen gouging the eye of Barcelona's assistant coach Tito Vilanova during a brawl at the end of the game. After the game, Mourinho did not comment on the incident except to claim that he did not know who "Pito" Vilanova was, with "''pito''" being Spanish slang for penis.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/18/jose-mourinho-escape-charges-super-cup |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Sid |last=Lowe |title=José Mourinho likely to escape charges for role in Super Cup melee |date=18 August 2011 |access-date=12 December 2016 |archive-date=9 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109011118/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/18/jose-mourinho-escape-charges-super-cup |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Manchester United===

The Football Heritage speech was made by Mourinho on 16 March 2018, during a press conference after his [[Manchester United]] side lost to [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. The 2–1 loss was the first time that Manchester United lost to Sevilla in European competition. During his 12-minute speech, Mourinho made various remarks and criticised the management of Manchester United, implying that a club's success stems from the calibre of players they sign.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jose Mourinho's defence – full transcript from Man Utd manager |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/11292412/jose-mourinhos-defence-full-transcript-from-man-utd-manager |access-date=19 March 2024 |website=Sky Sports }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=19 March 2018|title=Jose Mourinho Defends Manchester United Record 12 Minutes|website=[[TheGuardian.com]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/16/jose-mourinho-defence-manchester-united-record-12-minutes}}</ref> Mourinho defended his record of Champions League success in a subsequent press conference before an [[FA Cup]] tie against [[Brighton & Hove Albion]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Mourinho's impassioned 12-minute defence |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/43434736 |access-date=6 February 2024 |work=BBC Sport }}</ref>

On 23 October 2016, while Mourinho's Manchester United was trailing 4–0 against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea manager [[Antonio Conte]] waved up the home crowd, urging them to make more noise to support the team. At the end of the match, Mourinho shook Conte's hand and whispered into his ear, with media reports claiming Mourinho had accused Conte of trying to humiliate United with his actions. Both managers refused to confirm or deny the report, but Conte disputed claims that he was trying to antagonise Mourinho.

On first of December, Roma lost an away game against Bologna. Angry about the referee's decisions, Mourinho confronted him after the match to discuss the match incidents. After the match, Mourinho gave a quick press statement in which he advised Roma's attacker [[Nicolò Zaniolo]] to leave Serie A, hinting on presumed unfair treatment by the referees, Mourinho himself was given a yellow card for frequent protests.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mourinho dopo Bologna-Roma: "Fossi in Zaniolo, penserei di lasciare la Serie A".
