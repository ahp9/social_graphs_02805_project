'''Roy Maurice Keane''' (born 10 August 1971) is an Irish [[association football|football]] [[pundit]], former [[Coach (sport)|coach]], and former professional player. He is best known for his career in the [[Premier League]], in particular his captaincy of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. He is the joint most decorated Irish footballer of all time alongside [[Denis Irwin]] and [[Ronnie Whelan]], having won 19 major trophies in his club career, 17 during his time at Manchester United.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccer-ireland.com/footbal-miscellany/decorated-footballers.htm|title=Most Decorated Footballers : Ireland : Honours : Trophies|website=soccer-ireland.com}}</ref> Widely regarded as one of the greatest defensive midfielders of all time, one of the best players of his generation, and one of the greatest players in Premier League history, he was named by [[Pelé]] in the [[FIFA 100]] list of the world's greatest living players in 2004.<ref name="FIFA 100">{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3533891.stm|title=Pele's list of the greatest|date=4 March 2004|work=BBC Sport|access-date=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/10-greatest-midfielders-in-football-history/10 |title=10 greatest midfielders in football history: #1 Lothar Matthaus |website=sportskeeda.com |publisher=[[Sportskeeda]] |first=Ashwin |last=Hanagudu |date=17 September 2016 |access-date=6 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news  |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/101-greatest-football-players-last-25-years-full-list|title=Ranked!

In his 18-year playing career, Keane played for [[Cobh Ramblers F.C.|Cobh Ramblers]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], and Manchester United, before ending his career at [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. He was a dominating [[box-to-box]] midfielder noted for his aggressive and highly competitive style of play, an attitude that helped him excel as [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of Manchester United from 1997 until his departure in 2005. Keane helped United achieve sustained success during his 12 years at the club, winning seven [[Premier League]] titles, four [[FA Cup]]s, and the [[UEFA Champions League]]. He then signed for Celtic, where he won the [[Scottish Premier League]] and [[Scottish League Cup]] before retiring as a player in 2006.

Keane played at the international level for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] over 14 years, most of which he spent as captain. At the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], he played in every Republic of Ireland game. He was sent home from the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] after a [[Saipan incident|dispute]] with national coach [[Mick McCarthy]] over the team's training facilities.

Keane began his management career at [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] shortly after his retirement as a player and took the club from 23rd position in the [[EFL Championship|Football League Championship]], in late August, to winning the division title and gaining promotion to the [[Premier League]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=A jolt of T&T sets Sunderland dancing to promotion tune |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/Match_Report/0,,-72822,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Stuart |last=James |date=5 March 2007 |access-date=22 May 2010 |archive-date=13 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013174102/http://football.guardian.co.uk/Match_Report/0,,-72822,00.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> He resigned in December 2008,<ref name=bbcleavingsafc>{{Cite news |title=Keane and Sunderland part company |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/7764671.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=4 December 2008 |access-date=4 December 2008 }}</ref> and from April 2009 to January 2011, he was manager of Championship club [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].<ref name=sackedbyipswich>{{Cite news |title=Roy Keane sacked as Ipswich manager |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/9346787.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=7 January 2010 |access-date=7 January 2010 }}</ref> In November 2013, he was appointed assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland national team by manager [[Martin O'Neill]], a role he held until 2018.<ref name="RTE mutual">{{cite news |url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2018/1121/1012347-martin-oneill-and-roy-keane-part-company-with-fai/|title=Martin O'Neill and Roy Keane leave Ireland jobs by mutual agreement|date=21 November 2018|access-date=21 November 2018|publisher=RTE}}</ref> He also had brief spells as assistant manager at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 2014 and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in 2019. Following his departure as manager of Ipswich, Keane began a career in the media working for British channels [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Sky Sports]] as an in-studio football analyst.<ref>{{Cite web |last=O'Neill |first=Connor |last2=Burnham |first2=Dan |date=2024-08-14 |title=Roy Keane confirms intentions to quit Sky Sports and ITV pundit role |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-united-great-roy-keane-29738031 |access-date=2025-08-23 |website=Manchester Evening News |language=en}}</ref> He was inducted into the [[Premier League Hall of Fame]] in 2021.<ref name="PLHall" />

==Early life==
Roy Maurice Keane was born into a [[working class]] family in the Ballinderry Park area of [[Cork (city)|Cork]]'s [[Mayfield, Cork|Mayfield]] suburb on 10 August 1971.<ref name="Hugman2006–07 228">{{Cite book |editor-first=Barry J. |editor-last=Hugman |title=The PFA Footballers' Who's Who 2006–07 |year=2006 |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |isbn=978-1-84596-111-4 |page=228 }}</ref> His father Maurice worked at a local [[Knitted fabric|knitwear]] company and at [[Murphy's Irish Stout]] brewery, among others. Keane's family was keen on sport, especially football, and many of his relatives had played for junior Cork clubs such as [[Rockmount A.F.C.|Rockmount]]. Keane took up [[boxing]] at age nine and trained for several years, winning all of his four bouts in a novice league. During this period, he was developing as a promising footballer at Rockmount, and his potential was highlighted when he was voted "[[Player of the year award|Player of the Year]]" in his first season. Many of his teammates were offered trials abroad with English football teams, but Keane was not. He supported [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] as a child, citing [[Liam Brady]] and [[Glenn Hoddle]] as his favourite players, but [[Manchester United F.C.]] player [[Bryan Robson]] later became the footballer he most admired.<ref name="autobiography">{{Cite book|title=Keane: The Autobiography|publisher=Penguin|year=2002|isbn=978-0-14-100981-0|url=https://archive.org/details/keaneautobiograp0000kean}}</ref>

==Club career==
===Cobh Ramblers===
Initially, Keane was turned down from the Ireland schoolboys squad after a trial in [[Dublin]]; one explanation from former Ireland coach and scout Ronan Scally was that the 14-year-old Keane was "just too small" to make it at the required level.<ref name="autobiography" /> Undeterred, he began applying for trials with English clubs, but he was turned down by each one. As his childhood years passed, he took up temporary jobs involving manual work while waiting for a breakthrough in his football prospects. In 1989, he eventually signed for the [[Semi-professional sports|semi-professional]] [[League of Ireland|Irish]] club [[Cobh Ramblers F.C.|Cobh Ramblers]] after persuasion from Ramblers' youth team manager Eddie O'Rourke. Keane was one of two Ramblers representatives in the inaugural FAI/FAS scheme in the [[Dublin]] suburb of [[Palmerstown]], and it was through this initiative that he got his first taste of full-time training, facilitated by living in nearby [[Leixlip]], [[County Kildare]] from Monday-Friday.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://keepitonthedeck.com/blog/2019/7/23/persistent-road-to-greatness-the-roy-keane-story|title=91 of 92 Clubs Missed Out - The Roy Keane Story|date=23 July 2019|website=Keepitonthedeck}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.balls.ie/football/roy-keanes-cobh-ramblers-career-press-cuttings-stats-215689|title=Roy Keane's Cobh Ramblers Career In Contemporary Press Cuttings And Stats|first=Conor|last=Neville|date=7 December 2016|website=Balls.ie}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soccer-ireland.com/saipan/roy-keane/away-from-home.htm|title=Roy Keane: Being away from home: Cork|date=22 December 2022}}</ref> His rapid progression into a promising footballer was reflected by the fact that he would regularly turn out for Ramblers' youth side as well as the actual first team, often playing twice in the same weekend as a result.

Keane's Cobh senior debut came on 13 August 1989 in [[Buckley Park]] as the Rams went down 2–0 to Kilkenny City in the Opel [[League of Ireland Cup|League Cup]]. First-team manager Liam McMahon gave Keane his [[League of Ireland]] debut on 5 November that year, in a 2–1 loss at Bray Wanderers. That season he would make 29 senior appearances as Cobh finished seventh. His two goals came against St Francis and Finn Harps.<ref>{{Cite web |date=3 November 2022 |title=Roy Keane – Hall of Fame - Cobh Ramblers Football Club |url=https://cobhramblers.ie/roy-keane-hall-of-fame/ |access-date=2025-10-11 |publisher=Cobh Ramblers |language=en-US}}</ref>

In an [[FAI Youth Cup]] match against [[Belvedere F.C.|Belvedere]] in February 1990, Keane's performance attracted the attention of watching [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] scout Noel McCabe, who asked him to travel over to England for a trial. Keane impressed Forest manager [[Brian Clough]], and eventually, a deal for Keane worth £47,000 was struck with Cobh Ramblers in the summer of 1990.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ritter|first=Simon |title=Caught in Time: Cobh Ramblers with Roy Keane, 1990|work=[[The Times]] |date=31 October 2004|url=https://www.thetimes.com/article/caught-in-time-cobh-ramblers-with-roy-keane-1990-jdklpph6zrh|access-date=18 January 2025|location=London}}</ref>

Keane initially found life in [[Nottingham]] difficult due to the long periods away from his family, and he would often ask the club for a few days' home leave to return to Cork. Keane expressed his gratitude at Clough's generosity when considering his requests, as it helped him get through his early days at the club.<ref name="autobiography"/> Keane's first games at Forest came in the Under-21s team during a pre-season tournament in the Netherlands. In the final against Haarlem, he scored the winning penalty in a shootout to decide the competition, and he was soon playing regularly for the reserve team. His professional league debut came against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at the start of the [[1990–91 Nottingham Forest F.C. season|1990–91 season]], and the resulting performance encouraged Clough to use him more and more as the season progressed.

Keane eventually scored his first professional goal against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], and by 1991 he was a regular starter in the side, displacing the [[England national football team|England international]] [[Steve Hodge]]. Keane scored three goals during a run to the [[1991 FA Cup Final]], which Forest ultimately lost to Tottenham Hotspur. In the third round, however, he made a costly error against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], gifting a goal to the opposition and allowing them to draw the game. On returning to the dressing room after the game, Clough punched Keane in the chest in anger, knocking him to the floor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/roykeane/The-man-behind-the-myth.2740443.jp|title=The man behind the myth|date=8 January 2006|work=sport.scotsman.com|access-date=13 August 2012}}</ref> Despite this incident, Keane bore no hard feelings against his manager, later claiming that he sympathized with Clough due to the pressures of management<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/2770901.stm |title=When managers attack |work=BBC Sport |date=17 February 2003 |access-date=4 January 2010 |first=Tom |last=Fordyce }}</ref> and that he was too grateful to him for giving him his chance in English football. A year later, Keane returned to Wembley with Forest for the [[1991–92 Football League Cup|Football League Cup]] [[1992 Football League Cup Final|final]] but again finished on the losing side as Manchester United secured a 1–0 win.

Keane was beginning to attract attention from the top clubs in the [[Premier League]], and in 1992, [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] manager [[Kenny Dalglish]] spoke to Keane about the possibility of a move to the [[Lancashire]] club at the end of the season. With Forest struggling in the league and looking increasingly likely to be relegated, Keane negotiated a new contract with a relegation escape clause. The lengthy negotiations had been much talked about in public, not least by Brian Clough, who described Keane as a "greedy child"<ref name="autobiography" /> due to the high wages demanded by the Irishman. "Keane is the hottest prospect in football right now, but he is not going to bankrupt this club", Clough stated. Despite the extended contract negotiations, Forest fans voted him the club's Player of the Season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Drop could spark Forest break-up|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yM5OAAAAIBAJ&dq=nottingham%20forest%20manager&pg=4583%2C990051|date=3 May 1993|access-date=13 August 2012|work=New Straits Times|agency=Reuters|location=Kuala Lumpur}}</ref> Despite his best efforts, Keane could not save Forest from relegation, and the clause in his contract became activated. Blackburn agreed to a £4&nbsp;million fee for Keane, who soon after agreed to a contract with the club.

A mistake, however, prevented the move to the club: when the contract had been agreed upon, Dalglish realized they did not have the correct paperwork needed to complete the transfer. This was on a Friday afternoon, and the office had been locked up for the weekend. With a verbal agreement in place, they agreed to meet on Monday morning to complete the transfer officially. Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson]], hearing about the move, phoned Keane and asked whether he would like to join them instead of Blackburn. Ferguson ensured they had the paperwork ready and met up with Keane on Saturday and signed him for Manchester United for £3.75&nbsp;million, a [[Progression of the British football transfer fee record|British transfer record]] at the time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/23/roy-keane-career-highs-lows |title=The highs and lows of Roy Keane's career |date=23 April 2009 |access-date=13 July 2011 |work=guardian.com |publisher=Guardian News and Media |location=London }}</ref>

===Manchester United===

==== Early years: 1993–97 ====
Despite the then-record transfer fee, there was no guarantee that Keane would go straight into the first team. [[Paul Ince]] and [[Bryan Robson]] had established a formidable partnership in the center of [[midfield]], having just inspired Manchester United to their [[1992–93 FA Premier League|first league title]] since [[1966–67 Manchester United F.C. season|1967]]. Robson, however, was 36 years old and in the final stages of his playing career, and a series of injuries kept him out of action for most of the [[1992–93 Manchester United F.C. season|1992–93 season]] and into the [[1993–94 Manchester United F.C. season|1993–94 season]]. As a result Keane had an extended run in the team, scoring twice on his home debut in a 3–0 win against Sheffield United,<ref>{{cite news|title=Football: United make the most of Keane's eagerness|first=Phil|last=Andrews|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-united-make-the-most-of-keanes-eagerness-1462116.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=19 August 1993|access-date=20 January 2011}}</ref> and grabbing the winner in the [[Manchester derby]] three months later when United overturned a 2–0 deficit at [[Maine Road]] to beat [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] 3–2.<ref>{{cite news|title=Football: City cannot contain the genius of Cantona: Keane caps thrilling comeback victory for United in Manchester derby as Telfer's pilfering takes the spoils at Kenilworth Road|first=Joe|last=Lovejoy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-city-cannot-contain-the-genius-of-cantona-keane-caps-thrilling-comeback-victory-for-united-in-manchester-derby-as-telfers-pilfering-takes-the-spoils-at-kenilworth-road-1502826.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=8 November 1993|access-date=20 January 2011}}</ref>

Keane had soon established himself as a first-choice selection, and by the end of the season, he had won his first trophy as a professional as United retained their [[1993–94 FA Premier League|Premier League]] title. Two weeks later, Keane broke his [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] losing streak by helping United to a 4–0 victory over [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[1994 FA Cup final|FA Cup Final]], sealing the club's first-ever "[[Double (association football)|double]]".<ref>{{cite news|title=Football / FA Cup Final: Cantona's Doubletake: Rampant United realise the dream after Chelsea pay the penalty for missed chances|first=Ian|last=Ridley|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--fa-cup-final-cantonas-double-take-rampant-united-realise-the-dream-after-chelsea-pay-the-penalty-for-missed-chances-1436057.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=15 May 1994|access-date=20 January 2011}}</ref>

The [[1994–95 Manchester United F.C. season|following season]] was less successful, as United were beaten to the [[1994–95 FA Premier League|league title]] by Blackburn Rovers and beaten 1–0 in the [[1995 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Rideout's ticket to glory|first=Ian|last=Ridley|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rideouts-ticket-to-glory-1620376.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=21 May 1995|access-date=20 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Underdogs Everton win FA Cup|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/underdogs-everton-win-fa-cup-1620382.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=21 May 1995|access-date=20 January 2011}}</ref> Keane received his first [[Ejection (sports)|red card]] as a Manchester United player in a 2–0 [[1994–95 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-final replay win against Crystal Palace, after stamping on [[Gareth Southgate]],<ref>{{cite news|title=United carry on regardless to reach Wembley|first=Glenn|last=Moore|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/united-carry-on-regardless-to-reach-wembley-1615511.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=13 April 1995|access-date=20 January 2011}}</ref> and was suspended for three matches and fined £5,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Keane to feel the full force of FA retribution|first=Glenn|last=Moore|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/keane-to-feel-the-full-force-of-fa-retribution-1615633.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=14 April 1995|access-date=20 January 2011}}</ref><ref name="fine">{{cite news|title=Keane hit with fine after ban|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/keane-hit-with-fine-after-ban-1621314.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=27 May 1995|access-date=20 January 2011}}</ref> This incident was the first of 11 red cards Keane would accumulate in his United career, and one of the first signs of his indiscipline on the field.

The summer of 1995 saw a period of change at United, with Ince leaving for [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Inter land Ince and chase Cantona|first=Phil|last=Shaw|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/inter-land-ince-and-chase-cantona-1586582.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=15 June 1995|access-date=20 January 2011}}</ref> [[Mark Hughes]] moving to Chelsea<ref>{{cite news|title=Football: Hughes' move to Chelsea criticised|first=Guy|last=Hodgson|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-hughes-move-to-chelsea-criticised-1588109.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=24 June 1995|access-date=20 January 2011}}</ref> and [[Andrei Kanchelskis]] being sold to Everton.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kanchelskis to make debut for Everton|first=Guy|last=Hodgson|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/kanchelskis-to-make-debut-for-everton-1598054.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=26 August 1995|access-date=20 January 2011}}</ref> Younger players such as [[David Beckham]], [[Nicky Butt]] and [[Paul Scholes]] were brought into the team, which left Keane as the most experienced player in midfield. Despite a slow start to the [[1995–96 Manchester United F.C. season|1995–96]] campaign, United pegged back title challengers [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], who had built a commanding 12-point championship lead by Christmas, to secure another [[1995–96 FA Premier League|Premier League]] title. Keane's second double in three years was confirmed with a [[1996 FA Cup Final|1–0 win]] over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] to win the [[1995–96 FA Cup|FA Cup]] for a record ninth time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cantona the incomparable|first=Ian|last=Ridley|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cantona-the-incomparable-1346971.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=12 May 1996|access-date=20 January 2011}}</ref>

The [[1996–97 Manchester United F.C. season|next season]] saw Keane in and out of the side due to a series of knee injuries and frequent suspensions. He picked up a costly yellow card in the first leg of the [[1996–97 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] semi-final against [[Borussia Dortmund]],<ref name="shock">{{cite news|title=Football: United shocked by Tretschok|first=Glenn|last=Moore|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-united-shocked-by-tretschok-1266351.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=10 April 1997|access-date=20 January 2011}}</ref> which ruled him out of the return leg at [[Old Trafford]].<ref name="shock"/> United lost both legs 1–0,<ref>{{cite news|title=Wasteful United stricken by Ricken|first=Glenn|last=Moore|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/wasteful-united-stricken-by-ricken-1269050.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=24 April 1997|access-date=20 January 2011}}</ref> but this was compensated for by winning another [[1996–97 FA Premier League|league title]] a few days later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Football: Cruyff's delight enlivens drudge match|first=Guy|last=Hodgson|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-cruyffs-delight-enlivens-drudge-match-1261075.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=12 May 1997|access-date=20 January 2010}}</ref>

====Captaincy: 1997–2001====
After [[Eric Cantona]]'s unexpected retirement, Keane took over as club [[Captain (association football)|captain]], although he missed most of the [[1997–98 Manchester United F.C. season|1997–98 season]] because of a [[cruciate ligament]] injury caused by an attempt to tackle [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] player [[Alfie Haaland]] in the ninth [[1997–98 FA Premier League|Premier League]] game of the season. As Keane lay prone on the ground, Haaland stood over Keane, accusing the injured United captain of having tried to hurt him and of feigning injury to escape punishment, an allegation which would lead to an infamous incident between the two players four years later.

Keane did not return to competitive football that campaign, and could only watch from the sidelines as United squandered an 11-point lead over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] to miss out on the Premier League title. Many pundits cited Keane's absence as a crucial factor in the team's surrender of the league trophy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essendonfc.com.au/manunited/player.asp?id=14 |title=Player Profile: Roy Keane |work=Essendon FC website |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930123628/http://www.essendonfc.com.au/manunited/player.asp?id=14 |archive-date=30 September 2012 }}</ref>

Keane returned to captain the side the [[1998–99 Manchester United F.C. season|following season]], and guided them to a [[The Treble|treble]] of the [[1998–99 FA Premier League|FA Premier League]], [[1998–99 FA Cup|FA Cup]], and [[1998–99 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]]. In an inspirational display against [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] in the [[Juventus F.C. 2–3 Manchester United F.C.|second leg of the Champions League semi-final]], he helped haul his team back from two goals down to win 3–2, scoring the first United goal. His performance in this game has been described as his finest hour as a footballer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utvinternet.ie/newsroom/in-depth.asp?id=31935&pt=s |title=Strachan and Fergie hail retiring Keane |work=UTV |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013151156/http://utvinternet.ie/newsroom/indepth.asp?id=31935&pt=s |archive-date=13 October 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/scottishpremier/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/06/06/12/SOCCER_Keane.html |title=Keane forced to quit football |work=SportingLife |access-date=2 June 2007 |archive-date=30 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930055306/http://www.sportinglife.com/football/scottishpremier/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer%2F06%2F06%2F12%2FSOCCER_Keane.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Keane, however, received a yellow card after a trip on [[Zinedine Zidane]] that ruled him out of the [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|final]]. United defeated [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] 2–1 in the final, but Keane had mixed emotions about the victory due to his suspension. Recalling his thoughts before the game, Keane said, "Although I was putting a brave face on it, this was just about the worst experience I'd had in football." Keane sustained an ankle injury during the [[1999 FA Cup Final]], four days before the Champions League Final, which ruled him out until the following season.<ref>{{cite news |title=Big two gear up for Wembley |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/408265.stm |work=BBC News |date=30 July 1999 |access-date=24 March 2014 }}</ref> Later that year, Keane scored the only goal in the final of the [[1999 Intercontinental Cup|Intercontinental Cup]], as United defeated [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]] in Tokyo.

The following season saw prolonged contract negotiations between Keane and Manchester United, with Keane turning down an initial £2&nbsp;million-a-year offer amid rumours of a move to Italy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wldcup.com/euro/2000/news/1999Jul/19990714_852_world_soccer.html |title=Captain Keane rejects United contract offer |access-date=9 June 2007 |work=ATL World Cup Soccer }}</ref> His higher demands were eventually met midway through the [[1999–2000 Manchester United F.C. season|1999–2000 season]], committing him to United until 2004.

He was voted [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] and [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] at the end of the season after leading United to their sixth [[1999–2000 FA Premier League|Premier League]] title in eight years.

Keane caused controversy in November 2000, when he criticised sections of [[Manchester United F.C.#Support|United supporters]] after the [[2000–01 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] victory over [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] at Old Trafford. He complained about the lack of vocal support given by some fans when Dynamo was dominating the game, stating, "Away from home our fans are fantastic, I'd call them the hardcore fans. But at home, they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch. I don't think some of the people who come to Old Trafford can spell 'football', never mind understand it."<ref name="rants" /> Keane's comments started a debate in England about the changing atmosphere in football grounds,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/keane-prawn-crack-stirs-terrace-talk-624675.html |title=Keane prawn crack stirs terrace talk |work=The Independent |date=10 November 2000 |access-date=24 September 2010 |location=London |first=Nick |last=Harris }}</ref> and the term "[[prawn sandwich brigade]]" is now part of the English football vocabulary, referring to people who attend football games or claim to be fans of football because it is fashionable rather than due to any genuine interest in the game.

====Alfie Haaland incident====
Keane made headlines again in the 2001 Manchester derby, when five minutes from the final whistle, he was sent off for a knee-high foul on Alfie Haaland in what was seen by many as an act of revenge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/keane-haaland-clash-saved-my-career-1041900 |title=Keane: Haaland clash saved my career |work=Manchester Evening News }}</ref> He initially received a three-match suspension and a £5,000 fine from [[The Football Association]] (FA), but further punishment was to follow after the release of Keane's autobiography in August 2002, in which he stated that he intended "to hurt" Haaland. Keane's account of the incident was as follows:

<blockquote>I'd waited long enough. I fucking hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you cunt. And don't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries.<ref name="quotes">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/aug/24/sport.comment |title=10 classic Roy Keane rants |date=24 August 2006 |access-date=8 August 2014 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>
</blockquote>

His admission that the tackle was a premeditated assault led the FA to charge him with bringing the game into disrepute.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/2236929.stm |title=Keane charged by FA |work=BBC Sport |date=4 September 2002 |access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref> He was banned for a further five matches and fined £150,000 in the ensuing investigation.

====Later career: 2001–2005====
[[File:Roy Keane cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Keane with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 2005]]
United finished the [[2001–02 Manchester United F.C. season|2001–02 season]] trophyless for the first time in four years. Domestically, they were eliminated from the [[2001–02 FA Cup|FA Cup]] by [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the fourth round and finished third in the Premier League, their lowest final position in the league since 1991. Progress was made in Europe, however, as United reached the semi-finals of the [[2001–02 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], their furthest advance since their successful campaign of 1999. They were eventually knocked out on away goals after a 3–3 aggregate draw with [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], despite Keane putting United 3–2 up.

After the defeat, Keane blamed United's loss of form on some of his teammates' fixation with wealth, claiming that they had "forgot about the game, lost the hunger that got you the Rolex, the cars, the mansion".<ref name="autobiography" /> Earlier in the season, Keane had publicly advocated the breakup of the treble-winning team<ref name="Vieira">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.com/article/the-top-10-roy-keane-battles-6btc0m3dbh8 |title=The top 10 Roy Keane battles |work=Times Online |date=6 February 2005 |access-date=18 January 2025 |location=London |first=John |last=Aizlewood }}</ref> as he believed the team-mates who had played in United's victorious 1999 Champions League final no longer had the motivation to work as hard.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/11/19/sfnroy19.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013150759/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/11/19/sfnroy19.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 October 2007 |title=Keane exits still raging at the dying of the light |work=Daily Telegraph |location=London |first=Tim |last=Rich |date=19 November 2005 |access-date=22 May 2010 }}</ref>

In August 2002, Keane was fined £150,000 by Sir Alex Ferguson and suspended for three matches for elbowing [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]'s [[Jason McAteer]], and this was compounded by an added five-match suspension for the controversial comments about Haaland. Keane used the break to undergo an operation on his hip, which had caused him to take painkillers for a year beforehand. Despite early fears that the injury was career-threatening,<ref name="manutdzone">{{cite web|url=http://www.manutdzone.com/playerpages/RoyKeane.htm |title=Roy Keane: A career profile with pictures |work=ManUtdZone.com}}</ref> and suggestions of a future hip-replacement from his surgeon,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/2768049.stm |title=Keane faces hip replacement |work=BBC Sport |date=16 February 2003 |access-date=4 January 2010 }}</ref> he was back in the United team by December.

During his period of rest after the operation, Keane reflected on the cause of his frequent injuries and suspensions. He decided that the cause of these problems was his reckless challenges and angry outbursts which had increasingly blighted his career.<ref name="autobiography" /> As a result, he became more restrained on the field and tended to avoid disputes and confrontations with other players. Some observers felt that the "new" Keane had become less influential in midfield as a consequence of the change in his style of play, possibly brought about by decreased mobility after his hip operation. After his return, however, Keane displayed the tenacity of old,<ref name="manutdzone" /> leading the team to another league title in May 2003.

Throughout the 2000s, Keane maintained a fierce rivalry with Arsenal captain [[Patrick Vieira]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira relive rivalry - after the former |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news/roy-keane-and-patrick-vieira-relive-the-rivalry-after-a-shared-ice-cream-in-warsaw-8994133.html |access-date=24 March 2024 |work=The Independent |date=10 December 2013}}</ref> The most notable incident between the two took place at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] in 2005 at the height of an extreme period of bad blood between United and Arsenal.

The incident was broadcast live on [[Sky Sports]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira fight in tunnel at Highbury |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmv1l1oUHUA |website=YouTube |publisher=Irvine Ferris |access-date=15 February 2021}}</ref> with Keane heard telling match referee [[Graham Poll]] to, "Tell him [Vieira] to shut his fucking mouth!" After the game, which United won 4–2, Keane controversially criticised Vieira's decision to play internationally for [[France national football team|France]] instead of his country of birth, [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]]. Vieira, however, later suggested that having walked out on his national team in the [[FIFA World Cup]] finals, Keane was not in a good position to comment on such matters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/4554163.stm |title=Vieira hits out at Keane comments |work=BBC Sport |date=17 May 2005 |access-date=4 January 2010 }}</ref> Referee Poll later revealed that he should have sent off both players before the match had begun, though was under pressure not to do so.<ref name="sundaymirror.co.uk"/>

Overall, Keane led United to nine major honours, making him the most successful captain in the club's history. Keane scored his 50th goal for Manchester United on 5 February 2005 in a league game against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. His appearance in the [[2005 FA Cup Final|2005 FA Cup final]], which United lost to Arsenal in a penalty shoot-out, was his seventh such game, a record in English football at the time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/3725109.stm |title=Neville hails Ronaldo |work=BBC News |date=22 May 2004 |access-date=4 January 2010 }}</ref>

Keane also jointly holds the record for the most red cards received in English football, being dismissed a total of 13 times in his career. He was inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2004 in recognition of his impact on the English game and became the only Irish player to be selected into the [[FIFA 100]], a list of the greatest living footballers picked by [[Pelé]].<ref name="FIFA 100"/>

When called up for his first game at the international level, an [[Republic of Ireland national under-21 football team|under-21s]] match against [[Turkey national under-21 football team|Turkey]] in 1991, Keane took an immediate dislike to the organisation and preparation surrounding the Irish team, later describing the set-up as "a bit of a joke".<ref name="autobiography" /> He would continue to hold this view throughout the remainder of his time spent with the national team, which led to numerous confrontations with the Irish management. Keane declared his unavailability to travel with the Irish squad to Algeria, but was surprised when manager [[Jack Charlton]] told him that he would never play for Ireland again if he refused to join up with his compatriots.<ref name="autobiography" /> Despite this threat, Keane chose to stay at home on the insistence of Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough, and was pleased when a year later he was called up to the Irish squad for a friendly at [[Lansdowne Road]]. After more appearances, he grew to disapprove of Charlton's style of football, which relied less on the players' skill and more on continuous pressing and direct play. Tensions between the two men peaked during a pre-season tournament in the United States when Charlton berated Keane for returning home late after a drinking session with [[Steve Staunton]].<ref name="autobiography" />

Keane was included in the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland senior squad]] for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] in the U.S. and played in every game, including a famous 1–0 victory over tournament favourites and eventual runners-up [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. Despite a second-round exit at the hands of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], the tournament was considered a success for the Irish team, and Keane was named the best player of Ireland's campaign. Keane, however, was reluctant to join the post-tournament celebrations, later claiming that, as far as he was concerned, Ireland's World Cup was a disappointment: "There was nothing to celebrate. We achieved little."<ref name="autobiography" />

Keane missed crucial matches during the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|1998 World Cup qualification]] matches due to a severe knee injury but came back to captain the team to within a whisker of [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying|qualification]] for [[UEFA Euro 2000]], losing to [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] in [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying play-offs|a play-off]]. Ireland [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|secured qualification]] for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] under new manager [[Mick McCarthy]], greatly assisted by several match-winning performances from Keane. In the process of qualification, Ireland [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 2|went undefeated]], both home and away, against international football heavyweights [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and the Netherlands, famously beating the latter 1–0 at Lansdowne Road.

===2002 FIFA World Cup incident===
{{Main|Saipan incident}}
The [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI) selected the training base intended for use during Ireland's World Cup campaign. During the first training session, Keane expressed serious misgivings about the adequacy of the training facilities and the standard of preparation for the Irish team. He was angered by the late arrival of the squad's training equipment, which had disrupted the first training session on a pitch that he described as "like a car park".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/rep_of_ireland/newsid_2004000/2004160.stm |title=Keane blows his chance |work=BBC Sport |date=23 May 2002 |access-date=4 January 2010 }}</ref> After a row with goalkeeping coach [[Packie Bonner]] and [[Alan Kelly Jr.]] on the second day of training, Keane announced that he was quitting the squad and that he wished to return home to Manchester due to his dissatisfaction with Ireland's preparation. The FAI was unable to get Keane an immediate flight home at such short notice, meaning that he remained in Saipan for another night, but they called up [[Colin Healy]] as a replacement for him. The following day, however, McCarthy approached Keane and asked him to return to the training camp, and Keane was eventually persuaded to stay.

Despite a temporary cooling of tensions in the Irish camp after Keane's change of heart, things soon took a turn for the worse. Keane immediately gave an interview to leading sports journalist [[Tom Humphries]], of the ''[[Irish Times]]'' newspaper, where he expressed his unhappiness with the facilities in Saipan and listed the events and concerns which had led him to leave the team temporarily. McCarthy took offence at Keane's interview and decided to confront Keane over the article in front of the entire squad and coaching staff. Keane refused to relent, saying that he had told the newspaper what he considered to be the truth and that the Irish fans deserved to know what was going on inside the camp.<ref name="autobiography" /> He then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: "Mick, you're a liar... you're a fucking wanker. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks."<ref name="rants" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/aug/24/sport.comment |title=10 classic Roy Keane rants |work=Guardian football |location=London |date=24 August 2006 |access-date=22 May 2010 }}</ref> [[Niall Quinn]] observed in his autobiography that "Roy Keane's 10-minute oration [against Mick McCarthy, above] ... was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society." But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that, "[He] left us in Saipan, not the other way round. And he punished himself more than any of us by not coming back."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/5281188.stm |title=The Odd Couple |work=BBC Sport |date=27 August 2006 |access-date=4 January 2010 |first=Andrew |last=McKenzie }}</ref>

None of Keane's teammates voiced support for him during the meeting, although some supported him in private afterwards. Veterans Niall Quinn and Steve Staunton backed McCarthy in a press conference after the event. It was here that McCarthy announced that he had dismissed Keane from the squad and sent him home.<ref>{{Cite news |title=McCarthy dismisses Keane row |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/rep_of_ireland/newsid_2001000/2001200.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=22 May 2002 |access-date=4 January 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Keane sent home |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/rep_of_ireland/newsid_2003000/2003681.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=23 May 2002 }}</ref> By this time, the [[FIFA]] deadline for naming the World Cup squads had passed, meaning that Colin Healy was unable to be named as Keane's replacement and could not play in the tournament.

===Recall===
Mick McCarthy resigned as Ireland manager in November 2002 after defeats to [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying|qualification]] for [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]]. The possibility of Keane returning to the squad for future qualifiers was raised, as Keane had not yet fully retired from international football, insisting that McCarthy's presence was the main incentive for staying away from the Irish squad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=630&id=1235422002 |title=The Keane question catches McCarthy out |work=sport.scotsman.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013142649/http://sport.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=630&id=1235422002 |archive-date=13 October 2007 }}</ref> McCarthy's replacement, [[Brian Kerr (Irish football manager)|Brian Kerr]], discussed with Keane the possibility of a recall, and in April 2004 he was brought back into the Irish team to face [[Romania national football team|Romania]] on 27 May. Keane was not reinstated as captain, however, as Kerr decided to keep the armband with [[Kenny Cunningham]]. After the team failed to qualify for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], he announced his retirement from international football to help prolong his club career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/2005/oct/15keane.htm |title=Roy Keane retires from internationals |work=rediff.com}}</ref>

===Post-retirement===
Keane has reiterated his displeasure with the attitude and selection policy of the FAI. In March 2007, Keane claimed that several Republic of Ireland players get picked solely based on their media exposure and that the organisation was biased towards players originating from Dublin or other regions of [[Leinster]]: "Once you keep playing them on the reputation they've built up through the media or because they do lots of interviews, then it's wrong. There's a fine line between loyalty and stupidity."<ref>[https://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6477071.stm BBC Sport]. Newsimg.bbc.co.uk (21 March 2007). Retrieved on 5 March 2013.</ref> Keane claimed that Sunderland player [[Liam Miller]] was not picked because he was from Cork and that players with significant potential were failing to get picked for the national team. He also alleged that the FAI were incompetent in the running of their affairs.

Keane was involved in further controversy in the wake of Ireland's defeat by France in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA second round|qualification 2010 World Cup play-off]]. During an [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] press conference on 20 November 2009, Keane was critical of the Irish reaction to the [[Thierry Henry]] [[2009 Republic of Ireland v France football matches|handball incident]]. His response included criticisms of the Irish team's defence and the FAI authorities.

==Coaching career==
Keane's former manager Sir Alex Ferguson had previously said that he wanted Keane to succeed him as Manchester United coach when he retired. In the wake of Keane's acrimonious departure from the club, however, Ferguson became evasive regarding Keane's prospects as a manager: "Young managers come along and people say this one will be England manager or boss of this club, but two years later they're not there. It's not an easy environment to come into, I wouldn't forecast anything."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200511/11/eng20051111_220557.html |title=Ferguson plays down Keane hopes to coach Man Utd |work=People's Daily Online}}</ref>

===Sunderland===
During his time at Celtic, Keane was suggested as a potential managerial successor to [[Gordon Strachan]] by former Celtic player [[Charlie Nicholas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=538&id=2428792005 |title=Keane can be next manager says Nicholas |work=sport.scotsman.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817221740/http://sport.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=538&id=2428792005 |archive-date=17 August 2007 }}</ref> However, it was [[Football League Championship|Championship]] club Sunderland where Keane chose to launch his managerial career, reuniting him with the club's chairman and outgoing manager, Niall Quinn. The two men, publicly at least, were on opposing sides during the fall-out from the Saipan incident, but they were on good terms at the time of the managerial appointment, with Quinn urging Sunderland fans to "support and enjoy one of football's true greats".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccerlens.com/manchester-united-legend-roy-keane-signs-3-year-contract-as-sunderland-manager/2202559.html |title=Roy Keane Signs 3 Year Contract As Sunderland Manager |work=Soccerlens |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129144204/http://soccerlens.com/manchester-united-legend-roy-keane-signs-3-year-contract-as-sunderland-manager/2202559.html |archive-date=29 November 2006 }}</ref>

Keane signed a three-year deal immediately after Sunderland's victory over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 28 August, the Mackems' first win of the [[2006–07 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2006–07 season]] after a dreadful run of four consecutive defeats under Quinn's temporary management. With his new club sitting in the relegation zone already, second bottom of the Championship table, Keane chose to enforce changes quickly. His first actions as manager were deciding to keep the existing assistant manager, [[Bobby Saxton]], and to appoint his former Nottingham Forest colleague [[Tony Loughlan]] as head coach. He wasted no time in bringing in new additions to the squad, with a total of six players signing on the final day of the August [[transfer window]]. The most notable signings were Keane's former Manchester United teammates [[Dwight Yorke]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/5300876.stm |title=Yorke completes Sunderland move |work=BBC Sport |date=31 August 2006 |access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref> and Liam Miller,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safc.com/news/?page_id=10360 |title=Miller makes it five |work=safc.com}}</ref> supported by former Celtic colleagues [[Ross Wallace]] and [[Stanislav Varga]],

Keane's first two games as manager could not have gone much better; first coming from behind to beat [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] 2–1, followed by an easy 3–0 victory over Leeds United. Sunderland began to steadily creep up the league standings under Keane's management, and by the turn of the year, they had escaped the bottom half of the league. Five further players were signed during the January 2007 [[transfer window]], three ([[Anthony Stokes (footballer)|Anthony Stokes]], [[Carlos Edwards]] and [[Stern John]]) on permanent contracts and two ([[Jonny Evans]] and [[Danny Simpson]]) on loan from Manchester United, Keane's old club. Results continued to improve, and Keane was rewarded with the February and March Manager of the Month awards,<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/6408171.stm Keane earns Championship honour] BBC News</ref> while his team began to challenge for the automatic promotion places. Meanwhile, Keane tackled his players' non-professional approach with a firm hand. When three players were late for the team coach on a trip to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], in March 2007, he simply left them behind.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=Michael |title=Keane forgives but will not forget the Barnsley Three |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/13/newsstory.sport9 |website=The Guardian |date=13 March 2007 |access-date=23 January 2021}}</ref>

Sunderland secured promotion to the Premier League – along with [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] – on 29 April when rivals Derby were beaten by Crystal Palace.<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/6605665.stm Birmingham & Sunderland promotion] BBC Sport</ref> A week later, the Championship title was sealed, and Sunderland's revival under Keane was complete. His achievements also earned him the Championship Manager of the Year award.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/r/reading/6661535.stm |title=Coppell wins boss of year award |work=BBC Sport |date=16 May 2007 |access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref>

The lowest point of their next season came at [[Goodison Park]], where they were beaten 7–1 by Everton, which Keane described as "one of the lowest points" of his career. In the second half of the season, however, the team's form was much improved (especially at home) and survival in the division was guaranteed with two games to go with a home win against Middlesbrough. Meanwhile, Keane carried on his trend of buying ex-Manchester United players with the addition of [[Kieran Richardson]], [[Paul McShane (Irish footballer)|Paul McShane]], [[Danny Higginbotham]] and [[Phil Bardsley]]. He has also continued his strict disciplinary policy by putting Liam Miller (one of Sunderland's more consistent players) on the transfer list for being regularly late for training and other team meetings.

The beginning of the [[2008–09 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2008–09 season]] would prove to be tumultuous. In September 2008 Keane became embroiled in a row with FIFA Vice-President [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]] over the withdrawal of Dwight Yorke from the [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago national team]]. Warner accused Keane of being disrespectful towards small countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/sport/Exclusive-Keane-accused-in-TT.4476257.jp |title=Exclusive: Keane accused in T&T row |work=Sunderland Echo}}</ref> Keane responded by calling Warner "a clown" and insisted that Yorke was retired from international football.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/7609778.stm |title=Furious Warner hits back at Keane |work=BBC Sport |date=12 September 2008 |access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref> That same month Keane experienced "one of the worst and longest nights" of his career when Sunderland had to come from 2–0 down at home in a [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] tie against [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]]. The game ended 2–2, with Sunderland progressing narrowly on penalties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_cup/7626765.stm |title=Sunderland 2–2 Northampton (aet) |work=BBC Sport |date=23 September 2008 |access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref>

Despite some positive performances, including the historic 2–1 home victory against local rivals Newcastle United on 25 October (the first time the club had accomplished this in 28 years),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safc.com/match/?page_id=15991 |title=Sunderland 2 Newcastle United 1 |work=safc.com}}</ref> as well as good showings by recent signings like [[Djibril Cissé]] and [[Anton Ferdinand]], the team's general form remained inconsistent. By the end of November, Sunderland was 18th in the Premier League, having lost five of their six previous games. Keane stood down as manager on 4 December after bringing doubt on his future with comments made in the wake of the 4–1 home defeat by [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] the previous weekend.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11695_4587582,00.html |title=Keane leaves Black Cats: Sunderland manager quits |work=Sky Sports News |date=4 December 2008}}</ref> Keane's harsh management style was not appreciated by the Sunderland players, who were reported to have celebrated when they heard he had resigned.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/sunderland/3551680/Sunderland-players-celebrate-after-Roy-Keane-resigns-Football.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/sunderland/3551680/Sunderland-players-celebrate-after-Roy-Keane-resigns-Football.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Sunderland players celebrate after Roy Keane resigns|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=4 December 2008}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[The Irish Times]]'' on 21 February 2009, Keane cited differences with Sunderland's 30% shareholder [[Ellis Short]] and strains with club chairman Niall Quinn as the factors in his decision to resign as Sunderland manager.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0221/breaking6.htm |title=Keane speaks out on Sunderland departure |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=2 February 2009}}</ref>

===Ipswich Town===
On 23 April 2009, Keane was appointed as the new manager of Ipswich Town on a two-year contract,<ref name="Ipswich-Keane">{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_5226790,00.html|title=Ipswich Appoint Keane|work=Sky Sports|date=23 April 2009|access-date=23 April 2009}}</ref> the day after the club had dismissed [[Jim Magilton]].<ref name="Ipswich-Keane" /> His first game in charge came the following Saturday with a 3–0 away win over [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], the final league match to be played at [[Ninian Park]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/8001889.stm|title=Cardiff 0–3 Ipswich|work=BBC Sport|date=25 April 2009|access-date=25 April 2009}}</ref> The following week, Ipswich rounded off the season with a 2–1 win over [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10272,00.html |title=Ipswich 2–1 Coventry City |work=ITFC |date=3 May 2009 |access-date=29 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505001258/http://www.itfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0%2C%2C10272%2C00.html |archive-date=5 May 2009 }}</ref> In the [[2009–10 Ipswich Town F.C. season|2009–10 season]], Keane started to sign some players, some of them from his former club Sunderland. He signed goalkeeper [[Márton Fülöp]], midfielders [[Carlos Edwards]] and [[Grant Leadbitter]] and brought in [[Jack Colback]], [[David Healy (footballer)|David Healy]] and [[Daryl Murphy]] on loan to the club. Ipswich started without a win in their first 14 matches, making them the last team to record their first win in the whole league, finally winning on 31 October against Derby County and recording their first away win of the season on 29 November against Cardiff City. Their form gradually improved throughout the season, but Ipswich drew far too many games to come anywhere near the promotion race and they finished the season in 15th place.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/ipswich-town |work=BBC News |title=Ipswich owner backs boss Jewell}}</ref> Many inconsistencies in the 2009–10 and the [[2010–11 Ipswich Town F.C. season|2010–11 season]] meant that Keane's Ipswich side never really challenged for promotions and as a result of a poor run of form, ending up with his side dropping to as low as 21st in the Championship. Keane was dismissed as Ipswich manager on 7 January 2011.<ref name=sackedbyipswich/>

===National team===
On 5 November 2013, the FAI announced that [[Martin O'Neill]] had been made the Republic of Ireland manager and that Keane had been made the assistant manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/international/2013/1105/484722-fai-confirm-oneill-as-new-ireland-manager/|title=Martin O'Neill and Roy Keane have signed two-year Ireland contract|publisher=RTÉ|date=5 November 2013}}</ref> Their first match was against [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] at the [[Aviva Stadium]] in a 3–0 victory on 15 November 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/match/republic-of-ireland-vs-latvia/1600669/report|title=Republic of Ireland 3-0 Latvia|publisher=Goal.com|date=15 November 2013}}</ref> After [[Neil Lennon]] left Celtic at the end of the [[2013–14 Celtic F.C. season|2013–14 season]], Keane looked set to become the new manager of the Hoops.

In October 2014, Keane caused controversy after his book was released before crucial [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|Euro 2016 qualifiers]] against [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]] and [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. Martin O'Neill, however, rejected the claims that it was a distraction.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thescore.ie/martin-oneill-roy-keane-book-1710856-Oct2014/ |title=Martin O'Neill: Keane book is no distraction ahead of crucial qualifiers |publisher=The Score.ie |date=7 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129041154/http://www.thescore.ie/martin-oneill-roy-keane-book-1710856-Oct2014/ |archive-date=29 November 2014 }}</ref>

A month later, before Ireland's crucial qualifier against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], Keane was involved in an incident with a fan in the team hotel. An ambulance for the fan was called as well as the [[Garda Síochána]], but no arrests or complaints were made.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/Roy-Keane-centre-bizarre-hotel-4618141Z |title=Roy Keane at the centre of bizarre hotel bust-up after fan taken to hospital |work=Irish Daily Mirror |date=13 November 2014 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The FAI and Martin O'Neill came out in support of Keane after the incident.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/international/2014/1112/658885-gardai-called-to-ireland-team-hotel/|title=FAI backs Keane after incident at team hotel|publisher=RTÉ|date=13 November 2014}}</ref> It later emerged that CCTV footage exonerated Keane of any wrongdoing. The man involved in the incident is [[Brendan Grace]]'s son-in-law Frank Gillespie, who is believed to have asked Keane to sign a copy of Keane's autobiography ''The Second Half''. Keane refused to do so, and Gillespie confronted Keane but then collapsed and an ambulance was called to the hotel. Grace stated that Gillespie and Keane were "old buddies".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/cctv-footage-to-exonerate-keane-fai-30740600.html|title=CCTV footage to exonerate Keane – FAI|date=12 November 2014|work=Irish Independent}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/comic-claims-soninlaw-and-roy-old-buddies-30752860.html|title=Comic claims son-in-law and Roy 'old buddies'|work=Irish Independent|date=18 November 2014}}</ref>

After the Scotland game, Keane claimed that Everton were putting pressure on the Irish players like [[Séamus Coleman]] and [[James McCarthy (footballer)|James McCarthy]] (who missed the Scotland match through injury) to pull out of international squads; Everton chairman [[Bill Kenwright]] refuted this claim, saying Keane says "stupid things". Then-Everton manager [[Roberto Martínez]] also dismissed Keane's comments.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thescore.ie/roy-keane-everton-bill-kenwright-ireland-1784612-Nov2014/ |title='I'm a big fan of Roy Keane but he says some stupid things' – Everton chairman |publisher=The Score.ie |date=17 November 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129041156/http://www.thescore.ie/roy-keane-everton-bill-kenwright-ireland-1784612-Nov2014/ |archive-date=29 November 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30130632|title=Roy Keane criticism is nonsense - Everton boss Roberto Martinez|work=BBC Sport|date=20 November 2014}}|</ref>

Again Keane was in the headlines after a heated press conference with journalists before the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] match. Keane got in a row with a journalist after he was questioned if he was becoming a distraction from the Republic of Ireland cause.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/international/2014/1117/660034-keane-lashes-out-at-media/|title=Keane lashes out at media after distraction claims|publisher=RTÉ|date=17 November 2014}}</ref> [[Eamon Dunphy]] called on the FAI and Martin O'Neill to stop Keane from giving interviews to end the circus of media attention around him.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/irish/2014/1117/660297-dunphy-roy-keane-show-must-end-now/|title=Eamon Dunphy: 'Roy Keane show' must end now|publisher=RTÉ|date=18 November 2014}}</ref>

In November 2018, Keane and O'Neill left their jobs by "mutual agreement".<ref name="RTE mutual"/>

===Aston Villa===
On 1 July 2014, Keane was confirmed as Aston Villa's new assistant manager, working alongside manager [[Paul Lambert]]. He combined this role with his assistant manager's role with the Republic of Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/01/roy-keane-aston-villa-assistant-manager-ireland|title= Roy Keane appointed Aston Villa assistant manager|date=1 July 2014|work=Guardian |access-date=2 July 2014}}</ref> On 28 November 2014, however, Keane quit his role as assistant manager at Aston Villa to concentrate on his assistant manager role with Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/roy-keane-quits-aston-villa-keane-leaves-role-as-paul-lamberts-assistant-after-just-four-months-to-focus-of-republic-of-ireland-job-9889520.html|title=Roy Keane quits Aston Villa: Keane leaves role as Paul Lambert's assistant after just four months to focus of Republic of Ireland job|date=28 November 2014|work=The Independent|access-date=28 November 2014}}</ref>

===Nottingham Forest===
In January 2019, Keane became assistant manager to Martin O'Neill at Nottingham Forest,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47028542|title=Roy Keane: Ex-Nottingham Forest midfielder returns as Martin O'Neill's assistant|date=28 January 2019|website=BBC Sport}}</ref> leaving the role in June 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48737297|title=Roy Keane: Nottingham Forest assistant boss leaves Championship club|date=23 June 2019|website=BBC Sport}}</ref>

==Style of play==

{{BLP sources section|date=October 2025}}
Regarded as one of the greatest defensive midfielders of all time, Keane was a powerful, dominant, consistent, and highly competitive midfielder. In his prime, Keane was known for his work rate, mobility, energy, physicality, and hard-tackling style of play, which earned him a reputation as one of the best players in the world in his position. His playing style also earned him a degree of notoriety, due to his temper, tendency to pick up cards, confront opponents, and commit rash challenges. Usually operating in either a [[Midfielder#Holding midfielder|holding]] or [[Midfielder#Box-to-box midfielder|box-to-box]] role in the [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|centre]] of the pitch, his most prominent traits were his stamina, intelligence, positional sense, tenacity, aggression, physical strength, and ball-winning abilities, although he was a complete midfielder, who possessed a wide range of skills; indeed, he was also capable of carrying the ball forward effectively after obtaining possession, and either distributing it to other players, controlling the game and dictating the tempo in midfield, starting attacking plays, or even creating chances for his teammates, courtesy of his composure on the ball, first touch, and precise, efficient passing. He could even score goals himself, due to his attacking drive, eye for goal, a powerful shot from range, and his ability to make late runs into the penalty area, in particular in his early career.

In his later career, however, he modified his playing style and became more cautious in his play, occupying a deeper role, in order to compensate for his physical decline and loss of mobility following his hip operation, and attempted to avoid receiving so many bookings as a result of outbursts or reckless challenges. An influential presence on the pitch, in addition to his playing ability, Keane also stood out for his leadership and determination throughout his career, as well as his strong character. However, he also struggled out with injuries throughout his career.{{#tag:ref|See<ref name="FIFA 100"/><ref name="autobiography" /><ref name="manutdzone" /><ref>{{cite

Regarding his work rate, mentality, and influence, his former teammate Gary Neville said of him: "His greatest gift was to create a standard of performance which demanded the very best from the team. You would look at him busting a gut and feel that you'd be betraying him if you didn't give everything yourself."<ref name="Premier League 100"/> Steve McClaren, who served as Alex Ferguson's assistant manager during Keane's time at Manchester United, between 1998 and 2001, instead said of the midfielder's competitive spirit: "He mirrors the manager on the pitch. They are winners."<ref name="fearless force"/> Regarding Keane's complex character, despite his intensity on the pitch, Sean O'Hagan of ''The Guardian'' wrote in 2002 that he is "...a committed and confident warrior on the field, a shy, socially awkward, and often lonely introvert off it."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2002/sep/01/football.newsstory2 |title=Inside the minds of Roy Keane |work=The Guardian |last1=O'Hagan |first1=Sean |date=1 September 2002 |access-date=15 January 2020 }}</ref>

==Outside football==

===Media career===
Keane has done media work but expressed his lack of enthusiasm to do so again in the future when he said in 2008, "I was asked last week by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] to do the Celtic game. A couple of weeks before that I was asked to do the United game against Celtic at Old Trafford. I think I've done it once for [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]]. Never again. I'd rather go to the dentist. You're sitting there with people like [[Richard Keys]] and they're trying to sell something that's not there. Any time I watch a game on television I have to turn the commentators off."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/sunderland/3400833/Roy-Keane-savages-brainwashing-media-pundits-in-defence-of-Arsene-Wenger-Football.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/sunderland/3400833/Roy-Keane-savages-brainwashing-media-pundits-in-defence-of-Arsene-Wenger-Football.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Roy Keane savages 'brainwashing' television pundits in defence of Arsene Wenger|first=Rob|last=Stewart|date=7 November 2008 }}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Keane later had a change of heart. Along with [[Harry Redknapp]] and [[Gareth Southgate]] (who had previously been stamped on by Keane during an FA Cup semi-final in 1995, leading to a [[Penalty card#Red card|red card]]), he was a pundit for ITV's coverage of the Champions League final between Manchester United and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].<ref>Walker, Michael (8 November 2008) [https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/dont-listen-to-tv-pundits-says-keane-1001031.html Don't listen to TV pundits, says Keane]. Independent.co.uk. Retrieved on 5 March 2013.</ref> In the 2011–12 season, he became ITV chief football analyst, appearing on nearly every Live ITV match alongside presenter Adrian Chiles and Gareth Southgate. He appeared on ITV in the Champions League including Chelsea's victory in the final against Bayern Munich, nearly all FA Cup matches including the final between Chelsea and Liverpool at Wembley, and England's competitive internationals and friendlies. He was also involved in the ITV team for Euro 2012 alongside long-time rival Patrick Vieira and they appeared together as pundits in Ireland–[[Spain men's national football team|Spain]] match and [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]–[[Russia national football team|Russia]] match, also appearing with Roberto Martínez and Gordon Strachan. Keane worked for ITV during his time as Republic of Ireland Assistant on UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League highlights shows between 2015-2018 but didn't appear on International Football apart from on the Final of UEFA Euro 2016, he covered 2018 FIFA World Cup & UEFA Euro 2020 for ITV Sport and appeared again on England Qualifiers from 2018, in 2021-2022 he became ITV chief analyst for FA Cup appearing alongside Ian Wright.<ref>{{cite web |title=It got really heated between Roy Keane and Ian Wright on ITV after England's World Cup exit |url=https://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/roy-keane-ian-wright-itv-england-world-cup-167975 |website=Sports Joe IE }}</ref>

Keane joined [[Sky Sports]] to work on ''[[Super Sunday (British TV programme)|Super Sunday]]'' starting in September 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Roy Keane joins Sky Sports |url=https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/11815187/roy-keane-joins-sky-sports |website=Skysports.com |publisher=Sky Sports |access-date=21 September 2019}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
The title refrain of [[Morrissey]]'s 1997 single "[[Roy's Keen]]" is a pun on Keane's name, as Morrissey acknowledged during live performances of the song by changing the lyrics to "never seen a keener midfielder".{{citation needed|date=May 2025}}

The character of Roy Kent, the irascible footballer featured in the TV series ''[[Ted Lasso]]'', is based on Keane. Upon learning this, Keane insisted that he was "a lot nicer" than Kent.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGoldrick |first1=Debbie |date=15 May 2022 |title=Yes, Roy Keane inspired Ted Lasso's Roy Kent |url=https://www.irishcentral.com/culture/entertainment/ted-lasso-roy-kent-roy-keane |access-date=22 January 2024 |website=Irish Central}}</ref>
