'''Peter Shreeves''' (born 30 November 1940) is a Welsh former [[Association football|football]] player and coach.

==Career==
Shreeves was born in [[Neath]] in South Wales where his mother had been evacuated to during the early stages of [[World War II]], but was brought up in [[Islington]], London. He began his career with non-league [[Finchley F.C.|Finchley]] from where he joined [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in January 1959. He made over 100 league appearances for Reading over the next seven years, but his professional career was curtailed by a broken leg.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20000430/ai_n14308023 Captain Atherton's band of hopefuls]. Findarticles.com. Retrieved on 8 February 2013.</ref> He left Reading in 1966 to join [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] club [[Chelmsford City F.C.|Chelmsford City]].

In the summer of 1969, Shreeves joined [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] where he remained until taking up a coaching post at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in 1974. Later that year he joined [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] as youth coach. In 1977, Tottenham manager [[Keith Burkinshaw]] promoted him to manager of the reserve team, and then as his assistant in 1980.

In June 1984, Shreeves was promoted to the manager's seat after Burkinshaw's resignation and took Spurs to third place in the league at the end of his first season as manager. This would normally have earned them a [[UEFA Cup]] place, but the ban on English clubs in European competition began at this time due to the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Tottenham finished 10th the following season and Shreeves was sacked in favour of [[David Pleat]] in May 1986.

In August that year Shreeves joined the coaching staff at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and in December 1988 was made assistant manager after [[Trevor Francis]] had been appointed as player-manager. He then worked as assistant to [[Steve Perryman]] at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] before working as [[Wales national football team|Wales]] assistant manager under [[Terry Yorath]].

Shreeves returned to Tottenham as manager in July 1991 after [[Terry Venables]] had moved upstairs to become Chief Executive. Tottenham had won the [[FA Cup]] under Venables, but Shreeves was sacked after just one season with Tottenham finishing 15th in the league.

From 1993 to 1996 he was assistant manager at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] before [[Glenn Hoddle]] became [[England national football team|England]] manager and [[Ruud Gullit]] did not include Shreeves in his management team.

Shreeves then became assistant manager to David Pleat at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], and worked alongside subsequent manager [[Ron Atkinson]]. He remained for a short while under the next manager, [[Danny Wilson (footballer, born 1960)|Danny Wilson]], but left to re-join Atkinson at [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], where the duo were unable to prevent the club from being relegated. Shreeves acted as interim manager of the club for a short while following Atkinson's retirement at the end of the season, but left upon the arrival of [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]] as manager.

He was out of work until March 2000, when he was asked to return to Sheffield Wednesday as caretaker manager after Danny Wilson was sacked. The Owls were struggling at the bottom of the Premiership, and despite managing a few decent results, Shreeves was unable to prevent relegation. He did not get the manager's job on a permanent basis, but was retained as assistant manager to [[Paul Jewell]], and got the job permanently when Jewell was sacked in February 2001. The Owls were looking in real danger of a second successive relegation at the time, but Shreeves kept them clear, earning the Manager of the Month award for March 2001 in the process.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1257662.stm Shreeves named manager of the month].

==Name==

There is some confusion about his name. His name is variously spelled "Shreeve" and "Shreeves" in different sources, as he mentions in an interview for the 2008 book "The Boys From White Hart Lane" by Martin Cloake and Adam Powley. The Tottenham Hotspur website still gives the spelling "Shreeves". He says "My real name is Shreeve, but over the years I've had so many people getting it wrong that in the end I thought, 'why not – it's Shreeves.' I've looked in the club handbooks and I see that one year my name is spelt with an 's' at the end, the next it is 'Shreeve'".<ref>{{cite book|last=Cloake & Powley|title=The Boys from White Hart Lane|year=2008|isbn=978-1-905326-38-9|page=210}}</ref>

==Family==
In 2020 Peter Shreeves family faced several criminal charges. His daughter Joanne Shreeves, was found guilty of [[Criminal damage in English law|Criminal damage]], [[Common assault]] and [[Public Order Act 1986|Threatening behaviour]] at Stratford's magistrates court in 2023. Shreeves was seen on [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] whilst his daughter Joanne allegedly threw cement at their neighbour's. At Thames magistrates court on 3rd of November 2023, Peter's wife Carole Shreeves was also cautioned for £4,829 of Criminal damage against their neighbours in 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-02-03 |title=Woman hurled cement at neighbours in bitter feud |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-64504868 |access-date=2023-11-11 |website=BBC News |language=en-GB}}</ref>
