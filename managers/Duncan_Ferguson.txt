'''Duncan Cowan Ferguson''' (born 27 December 1971) is a Scottish [[Association football|football]] manager and former player.

He began his career at [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] in 1990, and moved to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in 1993 for what was then a British transfer record fee. He spent the remainder of his career in England, moving to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 1994 before a stint with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] between 1998 and 2000, after which he returned to Everton, where he retired in 2006.

During his career, Ferguson won the [[FA Cup]] with Everton in 1995. He was [[Cap (football)|capped]] for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] seven times, playing at [[UEFA Euro 1992]], but made himself unavailable for selection for the national team from 1997 due to a dispute with the [[Scottish Football Association]] (SFA).<ref name="Sunday Times"/> He has scored more goals than any other Scottish player in England's [[Premier League]] since its creation in 1992.<ref name="highest_scot">{{cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/stats/top/players/goals?co=1&se=-1&co=1&cl=-1&iso=-1&po=-1?se=-1 |title=Premier League Player Stats |publisher=Premier League |access-date=18 April 2019}}</ref>

Ferguson's aggressive style of play resulted in a career total of nine red cards, as well as a three-month prison sentence following an on-field assault of [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]]' [[John McStay]] in 1994. Eight of those red cards were in the English Premier League, where he holds the joint record for dismissals alongside [[Patrick Vieira]] and [[Richard Dunne]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40704646| title=Premier League is 25 years old: Facts and figures behind the first quarter-century| work=BBC Sport|date= 8 August 2017 }}</ref> He is known by the nicknames "Big Dunc"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/newcastle-hero-ferdinand-carroll-just-big-dunc-1218281|title=Newcastle hero Ferdinand: Carroll just like big Dunc|website=www.tribalfootball.com|date=11 January 2010|access-date=2 July 2020|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406230824/http://www.tribalfootball.com/newcastle-hero-ferdinand-carroll-just-big-dunc-1218281|archive-date=6 April 2012}}</ref> and "Duncan Disorderly".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/the-ten-best-selfdestructive-sports-stars-1680658.html?action=Gallery&ino=9 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109230007/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/the-ten-best-selfdestructive-sports-stars-1680658.html?action=Gallery&ino=9 | url-status=dead | archive-date=9 November 2012 | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Matthew | last=Fearon | date=3 March 2010 | title=The ten best self-destructive sports stars}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/feb/03/sport.comment |title=Duncan Ferguson: a fine example |first=Michael |last=Hann |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=3 February 2006 |access-date=9 March 2021}}</ref>

Ferguson was promoted to the first-team coaching staff at Everton in 2014. Following the dismissal of Everton manager [[Marco Silva]] in December 2019, he was named as the team's [[caretaker manager]] until Silva's replacement [[Carlo Ancelotti]] was appointed [[manager (association football)|manager]] a few weeks later, at which point Ferguson was made assistant manager. Ferguson left Everton after a second stint as caretaker manager in 2022. After a brief spell as [[Forest Green Rovers F.C.|Forest Green Rovers]] manager, he was appointed manager of [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] in September 2023 and was sacked when the club went into administration in October 2024.

==Club career==
===Dundee United===
Born in [[Stirling]],<ref name=Hugman/> Ferguson played for the juvenile side Carse Thistle, initially as a left-back.{{Citation needed|date=August 2025}} [[Dundee United]] signed him as a schoolboy, and he went on to win the [[Scottish Youth Cup|BP Youth Cup]] in 1990.<ref name="Arab"/> Later that year, on 10 November, Ferguson made his professional debut for them against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at [[Ibrox Stadium]].<ref name="Arab">{{cite web|url=http://www.arabarchive.co.uk/player.php?id=130|title=Duncan Ferguson|publisher=ArabArchive.co.uk|access-date=21 February 2014}}</ref> His first goal was an extra-time winner against [[East Fife F.C.|East Fife]] in the [[1990–91 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup]] on 29 January 1991.<ref name="Arab"/>

===Rangers===

Of Ferguson's time at Rangers, one of his strike partners [[Mark Hateley]] said: "Duncan was a really good player, but I think he came to Rangers a couple of years too early. [[Walter Smith]] wanted me to take him under my wing. He was a boisterous young lad who wanted to play all the time. It was a period in his career where he'd gone from being a big fish in a small pond to being a small fish in the big pond at Rangers. He probably found that a bit difficult."<ref name=opengoal>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxYnPCuQeYg "MARK HATELEY | Open Goal Meets...

===Everton===
In October 1994, [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] were struggling under the management of [[Mike Walker (football manager)|Mike Walker]] and looking for options to reinvigorate their faltering season. The solution enacted was to take two Rangers players on a loan deal, [[Ian Durrant]] for one month and Ferguson for three. Ferguson's move to Everton was later made permanent by Walker's successor [[Joe Royle]], and Ferguson played a key role in saving Everton from relegation, and also helping them win the [[1994–95 FA Cup]].<ref name="Durrant and Ferguson loan deal">{{cite news|title=Football: Everton loan for Ferguson and Durrant|first=Derek|last=Potter|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-everton-loan-for-ferguson-and-durrant-1440770.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=4 October 1994|access-date=20 January 2011|location=London}}</ref> The subsequent [[1995–96 in English football|1995–96 season]] was less successful for Ferguson. A persistent [[hernia]] problem caused him to be unavailable for large amounts of time, as did his prison sentence during the first half of the season.<ref name="persistent hernia problem">{{cite news|title=Ferguson has second operation|first=Catherine|last=Riley|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/ferguson-has-second-operation-1598972.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=1 September 1995|access-date=20 January 2011|location=London}}</ref>

On 28 December 1997, Ferguson scored a [[List of Premier League hat-tricks|hat-trick]] against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in a 3–2 victory, the first time that a trio of [[Header (association football)|headers]] had been scored in the Premier League.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/43030.stm |title=Ferguson hits hat-trick for Everton |publisher=BBC |date=28 December 1997 |access-date=15 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38232131|title=West Bromwich Albion 3–1 Swansea City|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 December 2016|access-date=29 May 2017}}</ref> Everton finished the season surviving relegation only on goal difference.

===Newcastle United===
After bringing Ferguson to Newcastle, manager [[Ruud Gullit]] was rewarded when Ferguson scored twice on his debut against [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in the [[Premier League]]. The final result was a 3–1 victory to Newcastle.<ref name="Sunday Times"/> At the start of 1999, Ferguson suffered a hernia injury, meaning that he played only seven times in the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99 season]]. He made his comeback on 11 April, coming on as a substitute in a 2–0 extra-time FA Cup semi-final win over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shaw |first1=Phil |title=Football: Shearer strikes to deny Spurs |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-shearer-strikes-to-deny-spurs-1086734.html |access-date=27 January 2022 |date=11 April 1999}}</ref> and did the same in the [[1999 FA Cup Final]], which Newcastle lost to Manchester United.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lea |first1=Greg |title=Where are they now?

===Return to Everton===

====2000-01 season====

On 17 August 2000, Ferguson moved back to Everton for a fee of £3.75 million.<ref name="bbc_signs">{{cite news |title=Ferguson signs for Everton |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/e/everton/884163.stm |access-date=21 December 2019 |date=17 August 2000}}</ref> The transfer had previously been close to collapse as he sought a £1 million "loyalty payment" from Newcastle for not personally asking for a transfer; he had made the same amount of money from Everton when he transferred in 1998 on the same basis.<ref name="bbc_deadlock">{{cite news |title=Duncan's deadlock |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/880111.stm |access-date=21 December 2019 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 August 2000}}</ref>

Ferguson's return came at a time when Everton were facing the prospect of being without their goalscoring hero [[Kevin Campbell (footballer)|Kevin Campbell]] for the early months of the season due to injury.<ref name="toffeeweb_profile">{{cite web |title=Duncan Ferguson profile |url=https://www.toffeeweb.com/players/profiles/Ferguson.php |website=ToffeeWeb |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref> The £3.75 million fee was later revealed to have been financed through a media deal with [[NTL Incorporated|NTL]] that was never completed.<ref name="toffeeweb_profile" />

Two days after signing, he played his first game in a 2–0 loss at [[Leeds United]], coming on for [[Stephen Hughes (footballer, born 1976)|Stephen Hughes]] after 56 minutes.<ref name="bbc_leeds">{{cite news |title=Smith sparks Leeds flier |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/885983.stm |access-date=21 December 2019 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 August 2000}}</ref> On 23 August, on his return to Goodison Park, he scored twice in a 3–0 win over [[Charlton Athletic]] after coming on for [[Mark Hughes]] in the 67th minute. Ferguson settled the match with a low driven shot from a [[Thomas Gravesen]] pass before adding a second goal from a deflection in the dying seconds to complete the victory.<ref name="bbc_charlton">{{cite news |title=Gazza and Ferguson end Charlton fight |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/893458.stm |access-date=21 December 2019 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 August 2000}}</ref>

Ferguson was injured in only the second appearance of his return spell with the Blues and was in and out of the team that season with recurrent injury problems that required surgery. Despite this, he managed six goals in 13 appearances to help Everton avoid relegation. His first goal since the Charlton match came on 7 February 2001 against Leeds United, when his 23rd-minute scuffed right-foot shot found its way into the net, though he appeared to aggravate an arm injury while scoring and was substituted in the first half.<ref name="garrity_leeds">{{cite news |author=Paul Garrity |title=[Article title] |date=7 February 2001 |publisher=[Publisher needed]}}</ref>

Ferguson's other crucial goals during the relegation battle included an equaliser against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 8 April, created through a move involving [[Niclas Alexandersson]] crossing from the left for Campbell to head down before Ferguson slotted home despite lucky deflections.<ref name="pl_city">{{cite web |title=Everton v Man City, 2000/01 |url=https://www.premierleague.com/match/3598 |website=Premier League |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref>

In the Merseyside derby against Liverpool on 16 April, Ferguson scored in the 42nd minute after [[Kevin Campbell (footballer)|Kevin Campbell]] caused confusion in the penalty box, with Ferguson arriving to smash his effort beyond [[Sander Westerveld]] in a 2–3 defeat.<ref name="pl_liverpool">{{cite web |title=Everton v Liverpool, 2000/01 |url=https://www.premierleague.com/match/3616 |website=Premier League |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref>

His final goal of the season helped secure Premier League survival, scoring just 47 seconds into the second half against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] on 28 April by latching onto a long throw from [[Kevin Campbell (footballer)|Campbell]], controlling it well and driving it fiercely past the goalkeeper in a crucial 2–1 victory.<ref name="pl_bradford">{{cite web |title=Everton v Bradford, 2000/01 |url=https://www.premierleague.com/match/3633 |website=Premier League |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref><ref name="toffeeweb_profile" />

Ferguson played under manager [[Walter Smith]] during his initial return, though their relationship was strained by chairman [[Peter Johnson (businessman)|Peter Johnson]]'s decision to sell Ferguson to Newcastle in 1998 without Smith's knowledge.<ref name="efc_smith">{{cite news |title=Walter Smith |url=https://www.evertonfc.com/news/1113189/walter-smith |website=Everton FC |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref>

====2001-02 season====

The 2001-02 season began promisingly for Ferguson, who scored from the penalty spot in Everton's opening match away to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on 18 August 2001. After Charlton took the lead through [[Jonatan Johansson (footballer)|Jonatan Johansson]], Ferguson equalised from the penalty spot in the 64th minute after [[Kevin Campbell (footballer)|Kevin Campbell]] was fouled in the box, helping Everton to a 2-1 victory.<ref name="pl_charlton_0102">{{cite web |title=Charlton v Everton, 2001/02 |url=https://www.premierleague.com/match/3667 |website=Premier League |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref> The penalty was significant as Ferguson had previously avoided penalty-taking responsibility in a League Cup match against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] three years earlier.

Three days later, Ferguson scored another penalty in a 1-1 draw against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] at Goodison Park on 20 August. After [[Darren Anderton]] had given Spurs the lead on the stroke of half-time against the run of play, Ferguson equalised from the penalty spot in the 64th minute following [[Gary Doherty]]'s dismissal for fouling Campbell in the box. Despite Tottenham being reduced to nine men after [[Gustavo Poyet]] was also sent off two minutes later, Everton were unable to find a winner.

Ferguson continued his penalty-taking duties in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] second round against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 12 September, scoring in the 6th minute after Campbell was fouled. However, Palace equalised through [[Dougie Freedman]]'s penalty just four minutes later, and despite Ferguson converting his spot-kick in the subsequent penalty shootout, Everton lost 4-5 on penalties after a 1-1 draw.

When Smith was dismissed in March 2002 following a 3-0 FA Cup defeat to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], Ferguson transitioned to playing under new manager [[David Moyes]].<ref name="toffeeweb_march2002">{{cite web |title=Memories of the New Millennium - March 2002 |url=https://www.toffeeweb.com/season/19-20/comment/fanscomment/39284.html |website=ToffeeWeb |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref>

Ferguson's season was hampered by an undiagnosed injury that would cause recurring problems with pain manifesting in his leg, back, pelvis and groin. 
Despite this, he managed to score important goals under new manager [[David Moyes]], who replaced [[Walter Smith]] in March 2002. Ferguson played a crucial role in Moyes' first match in charge, a 2-1 victory over [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on 16 March 2002. After [[David Unsworth]] had given Everton the lead after just 27 seconds, Ferguson scored his first league goal from open play that season in the 13th minute by charging down a clearance from [[Edwin van der Sar]] and slotting the ball into the net.

Despite being reduced to ten men following [[Thomas Gravesen]]'s dismissal and Fulham pulling a goal back through [[Steed Malbranque]], Ferguson captained the side and was moved back to play as a centre-back to help defend as Everton held on for a vital victory.

Ferguson scored again in Moyes' second match as manager, a thrilling 4-3 victory away to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 23 March 2002. With Everton leading 3-1, Ferguson scored the fourth goal in the 71st minute after [[Niclas Alexandersson]] jinked his way into the area and squared the ball for Ferguson to side-foot elegantly into the top left corner. Despite Derby scoring twice more to make the final score 4-3, the victory represented only Everton's second away win of the season.

However, the optimism from Moyes' early matches was dampened by a heavy 6-2 defeat away to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 29 March 2002. Ferguson gave Everton the perfect start, scoring in the 6th minute with a speculative lob over [[Shay Given]] from a throw-in before he had even tied his bootlaces after changing his boots. Despite [[Niclas Alexandersson]] adding a second goal to make it 2-2, Newcastle responded with four unanswered goals in a devastating display.

Ferguson continued his important contributions under Moyes with a crucial equalising goal against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on 13 April 2002. After falling 2-0 behind to goals from [[Brian Deane]], Ferguson scored with five minutes remaining, firing home a half-volley from a free-kick to salvage a vital 2-2 draw in Everton's fight against relegation.
On 1 April 2002, Ferguson was sent off after 20 minutes for elbowing [[Bolton Wanderers]]' [[Kostas Konstantinidis]] in an off-the-ball incident in a 3–1 win for a struggling Everton side.<ref name="bbc_bolton">{{cite news |title=Everton leave Bolton struggling |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/1900942.stm |access-date=21 December 2019 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 April 2002}}</ref>

====2002-03 season====
The 2002-03 season proved to be a largely lost campaign for Ferguson due to injury problems. Despite showing promise in pre-season friendlies, where he scored a goal in a match against [[Queens Park FC|Queens Park]] that also featured a hat-trick from emerging teenager [[Wayne Rooney]], Ferguson's persistent undiagnosed injury problems severely limited his playing time. He required surgery during the season and managed only seven appearances without scoring a single goal.<ref name="cult_heroes_ferguson">{{cite web |title=Cult Heroes – 4# Duncan Ferguson |url=https://backpagefootball.com/cult-heroes-4-duncan-ferguson/10962/ |website=Back Page Football |date=6 November 2010 |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref>

Ferguson's limited involvement became a subject of significant criticism. His 192 minutes of play in 2002-03 as a goalless substitute cost the club £9,000 per minute.<ref name="wiki_ferguson_cite">{{cite news |author=Jamie Jackson |title=[Article about Ferguson being waste of money] |newspaper=The Guardian |date=August 2003}}</ref>

====2003-04 season====
Ferguson's persistent injury problems were eventually diagnosed as a compressed sciatic nerve, a condition that the Everton physiotherapy staff believed he had struggled with for approximately four years, with pain manifesting in various areas including his leg, back, pelvis and groin, making it difficult to diagnose.<ref name="toffeeweb_profile" /> Once properly identified and treated, Ferguson regained reasonable match fitness and began scoring goals again in the 2003-04 season.<ref name="toffeeweb_profile" />

In August 2003, Jamie Jackson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called Ferguson "arguably the biggest waste of money of all", citing his high transfer fees and wages compared to his injury record and age. By that point, he had scored 12 times in 41 games in three years at Everton, while earning over £5 million in salary.<ref name="wiki_ferguson_cite" />

Ferguson's return to form was evident from the start of the season, when he scored a penalty against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 13 September 2003. With Everton reduced to ten men following [[Gary Naysmith]]'s dismissal, Ferguson converted from the spot in the 88th minute to secure a 2-2 draw after [[Alan Shearer]] had scored two penalties for the visitors.<ref name="pl_newcastle_0304">{{cite web |title=Everton v Newcastle, 2003/04 |url=https://www.premierleague.com/match/4627 |website=Premier League |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref>

Ferguson continued to score regularly throughout the season in both league and cup competitions, including goals against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. His penalty-taking reliability was particularly evident in cup matches, where he scored from the spot against both [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and twice against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in the FA Cup, helping [[David Moyes]] secure his first FA Cup victory as Everton manager.<ref name="pl_newcastle_0304" />

On 28 December 2003, Ferguson came on for [[Marcus Bent]] in the 74th minute of Everton's 2–0 loss at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], and within ten minutes he was sent off for an elbow on [[Hermann Hreiðarsson]].<ref name="bbc_charlton_red">{{cite news |title=Charlton 2-0 Everton |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4107825.stm |access-date=21 December 2019 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 December 2004}}</ref>

Ferguson was accused of racial abuse by [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]'s [[Luís Boa Morte]] after an FA Cup fourth round match in January 2004. The accusation was dismissed by the Football Association, who found insufficient evidence.<ref name="independent_racial">{{cite news |last1=Nisbet |first1=John |title=FA dismisses Ferguson racial abuse allegations |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/fa-dismisses-ferguson-racial-abuse-allegations-568385.html |access-date=19 September 2019 |work=The Independent |date=1 April 2004}}</ref>

One of Ferguson's most notorious disciplinary incidents occurred during a match against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], when he was sent off for two yellow cards and subsequently confronted German midfielder [[Steffen Freund]], creating what became one of the most widely discussed images in Premier League history.<ref name="allfootball_journey">{{cite web |title=Duncan Ferguson's mad journey to the Everton dugout |url=https://m.allfootballapp.com/news/EPL/Duncan-Fergusons-mad-journey-to-the-Everton-dugout/2105661 |website=All Football |date=19 December 2019 |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref>

====2004-05 season====
In the summer of 2004, Everton attempted to buy out the final year of Ferguson's contract, which was worth approximately £2 million in salary, for a reduced payment of £500,000. Ferguson rejected this offer and instead adopted a new role primarily as a substitute to support David Moyes' tactical approach.<ref name="toffeeweb_profile" /> This arrangement earned him a contract extension for the following summer.<ref name="toffeeweb_profile" />

One of the highlights of Ferguson's later career came on 20 April 2005, when he scored a crucial header against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in a 1-0 victory at Goodison Park. Ferguson met a [[Mikel Arteta]] free-kick with a stooping header after 55 minutes to secure Everton's first Premier League victory over United since his own goal in 1995.<ref>{{cite web |title=Everton v Manchester United {{!}} 1994/1995 {{!}} Premier League {{!}} Overview |url=https://www.premierleague.com/en/match/15799?tab=recap |website=www.premierleague.com |publisher=Premier League |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Everton 1-0 Man Utd |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4451321.stm |publisher=BBC |access-date=31 August 2025 |date=20 April 2005}}</ref> The goal was particularly significant as it came during Everton's push for [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] qualification and coincided with [[Wayne Rooney]]'s first return to Goodison Park since his controversial transfer to Manchester United.<ref name="thesefootballtimes_inspiration">{{cite web |title=Duncan Ferguson: coach, captain, inspiration |url=https://thesefootballtimes.co/2015/07/31/duncan-ferguson-coach-captain-inspiration/ |website=These Football Times |date=23 April 2017 |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref> Ferguson later described the atmosphere as one of the best he had experienced at the ground, saying: "The roof came off, it [the ground] was shaking."<ref name="premierleague_farewell">{{cite web |title=Farewell Goodison Park: The best Premier League moments at Everton's stadium |url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/4309482 |website=Premier League |date=15 May 2025 |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref>

====2005-06 season====
During the 2005–06 season, Ferguson was sent off against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] for violent conduct. His confrontation with [[Paul Scharner]] and subsequent fracas with [[Pascal Chimbonda]] resulted in a seven-match ban and his eighth Premier League red card, equalling [[Patrick Vieira]]'s record.<ref name="allfootball_journey" />

Ferguson's final season was marked by disappointment, particularly the controversial disallowing of his goal in Everton's [[UEFA Champions League]] qualifier against [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] by referee [[Pierluigi Collina]].<ref name="toffeeweb_profile" /> The goal, a powerful header from a [[Mikel Arteta]] corner, would have levelled the tie and potentially sent the match to extra time, but Collina ruled it out for an alleged foul by [[Marcus Bent]] away from the ball.<ref name="sky_collina">{{cite news |title=Collina explains Dunc decision |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11731/2354766/collina-explains-dunc-decision |website=Sky Sports |date=11 November 2005 |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref> [[Diego Forlán]] scored moments later to eliminate Everton from the Champions League, and Ferguson later stated that the decision still "rankles" him, believing Everton could have performed well in the group stages.<ref name="hitc_villarreal">{{cite news |title=Everton legend relives injustice of 2005 Champions League tie |url=https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2014/10/02/everton-legend-relives-injustice-of-2005-champions-league-tie/ |website=HITC |date=2 October 2014 |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref>

On 7 May 2006, against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at Goodison Park, Ferguson was named captain in the game that marked the end of his Everton career. His 90th-minute penalty kick was saved by [[Tomasz Kuszczak]], but he subsequently scored from the rebound, netting his final goal for the club. Ferguson was not given a new Everton deal and retired, moving his family to Mallorca and spurning advances from a number of clubs.<ref name="efc_review2006">{{cite web | title = Review of the Year 2006 | work = Article on Evertonfc.com | url = http://www.evertonfc.com/match/review-of-the-year-may-2006.html | access-date = 11 January 2007 | archive-date = 28 February 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140228120902/http://www.evertonfc.com/match/review-of-the-year-may-2006.html | url-status = dead }}</ref> The decision to award Ferguson the captaincy was Moyes' way of signalling that it would be his final appearance, though Ferguson was not officially informed until after the match.<ref name="everton_news_moyes">{{cite news |title=Duncan Ferguson stunned after what Everton manager David Moyes told him, 'I couldn't believe it' |url=https://www.everton.news/duncan-ferguson-stunned-after-what-everton-manager-david-moyes-told-him-i-couldnt-believe-it/ |website=Everton News |date=5 May 2025 |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref>

====Fan relationship and cultural impact====
Throughout his second spell, Ferguson maintained his status as a cult figure among Everton supporters, earning the nickname "Big Dunc".<ref name="hexblog_bigdunc">{{cite web |title=Big Dunc |url=https://thehexblog.com/2024/09/13/big-dunc/ |website=The Hex Blog |date=23 September 2024 |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref> Despite his injury problems and disciplinary issues, he retained what observers described as an "idol-like status" during some of the club's darkest periods.<ref name="toffeeweb_profile" /> Ferguson's emotional connection with the supporters was exemplified by his passionate goal celebrations and his visible commitment to the club's cause.<ref name="hexblog_bigdunc" />

==International career==
Ferguson made his first full international appearance for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] on 17 May 1992, in a 1–0 win over the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] in [[Denver]]. He was selected for [[UEFA Euro 1992]] in Sweden, making one substitute appearance against reigning champions the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] on 12 June.<ref name = "sfa"/> He withdrew from [[UEFA Euro 1996]] in England due to surgery on a recurring hernia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Third hernia operation for Everton's Ferguson |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/third-hernia-operation-for-everton-s-ferguson-1346409.html |access-date=27 January 2022 |work=The Independent |date=8 May 1996}}</ref> He made seven Scotland appearances in all, with his last appearance coming in February 1997.<ref name = "sfa">{{SFA Profile|id=7076}}</ref><ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-scots-open-door-to-reluctant-ferguson-1084896.html Football: Scots open door to reluctant Ferguson], The Independent, 3 April 1999</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/mar/19/newsstory.sport1 Silent hero enjoying life], The Guardian, 19 March 2000</ref>

Ferguson refused international selection after 1997, partly in protest against his treatment by the SFA after his conviction for assault on John McStay and in particular the imposition of a 12-game ban on top of his three-month prison sentence.<ref>[http://www.toffeeweb.com/players/past/Ferguson.asp Ferguson] in ToffeeWeb {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207074405/http://www.toffeeweb.com/players/past/Ferguson.asp |date=7 February 2009 }}</ref> Ferguson believed that second punishment violated the principle of [[double jeopardy]].<ref name = walter/> Speaking in February 2023, Ferguson said that not playing more for Scotland was the "biggest regret in my career".<ref name = walter/> He also revealed that Scotland managers had repeatedly asked him to come out of retirement, with the last request coming from Walter Smith in 2005.<ref name = walter/> Ferguson blamed his own "pig-headedness" for not accepting those invitations.<ref name = walter>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64570643 |title=Duncan Ferguson: Boycotting Scotland was 'my biggest football regret' |website=BBC Sport |date=8 February 2023 |accessdate=8 February 2023}}</ref>

==Coaching career==
===Everton===
[[File:Duncan_Ferguson_2013.jpg|thumb|Ferguson with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2013]]
Having spent five years in [[Mallorca]] following his retirement from playing, Ferguson contacted his former manager at Everton, [[David Moyes]]. Ferguson asked if he could work with the Everton academy students at [[Finch Farm]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/everton/8835107/Duncan-Ferguson-returns-to-Everton-to-coach-youth-team.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/everton/8835107/Duncan-Ferguson-returns-to-Everton-to-coach-youth-team.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Duncan Ferguson returns to Everton to coach youth team|website=Telegraph.co.uk|date=19 October 2011 |access-date=31 October 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In May 2025, Ferguson published his autobiography titled "BIG DUNC: The Upfront Autobiography", which became a ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' bestseller.<ref name="amazon_bigdunc" /> The book provides what reviewers described as a "brutally honest" account of his life, covering his experiences in prison, his off-field controversies, and his efforts to turn his life around through football.<ref name="amazon_bigdunc" /> Ferguson undertook promotional tours for the book, including appearances at [[St George's Hall, Liverpool|St George's Hall]] in Liverpool.<ref name="stgeorges_conversation">{{cite web |title=Duncan Ferguson in conversation |url=https://stgeorgeshallliverpool.co.uk/events/duncan-ferguson-in-conversation/ |website=St George's Hall Liverpool |date=25 February 2025 |access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref>

===Burglary attempts at his homes===
In 2001, two burglars broke into Ferguson's home in [[Rufford, Lancashire]]. Ferguson confronted them and was able to detain one of them,<ref>{{cite web |title=Pair jailed for Ferguson burglary |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1287588.stm |website=BBC News |access-date=31 August 2025 |date=20 April 2001}}</ref> who subsequently spent three days in hospital.<ref name=burglars>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/2660021.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ferguson in burglar assault probe | date=15 January 2003 | access-date=1 May 2010}}</ref> The second man managed to flee but was eventually caught. Both men were sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment for their actions.

In January 2003, Ferguson caught another burglar at his home in [[Formby|Formby, Merseyside]]; the burglar attacked Ferguson, who retaliated. The burglar was hospitalised and later alleged that Ferguson had assaulted him, but this was dismissed by police.<ref name=burglars/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/2748887.stm |title=Jail for Ferguson's bruised burglar |newspaper=BBC |date= 13 February 2003 |access-date= 25 February 2016}}</ref>

===Convictions for physical altercations===
Ferguson has had four convictions for assault – two arising from [[Taxicab stand|taxi rank]] scuffles,<ref name="Sunday Times">{{cite web|url=http://www.nufc.com/html/sundaytimes_ferguson.html|title=Deadly Duncan Delivers|first=Douglas|last=Alexander|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=22 February 2000|via=NUFC.com}}</ref> one an altercation with a fisherman in an [[Anstruther]] pub,<ref name="Sunday Times" /> and one for his on-field headbutt on Raith Rovers defender [[John McStay]] in 1994 while playing for Rangers, which resulted in a rare conviction for an on-field incident.

The first incident led to a [[£]]100 fine for headbutting a policeman and a £25 fine for a [[breach of the peace]],<ref>''Duncan Cowan Ferguson v Andrew Christie Normand'' (Procurator Fiscal, Glasgow) 1995 S.C.C.R. 770</ref> while the second resulted in a £200 fine for punching and kicking a supporter on crutches.

===Campaigning===
In 2009, Ferguson pledged his support to the [[The Kirkby Project#Keep Everton In Our City Campaign|"Keep Everton in Our City"]] campaign, saying:

{{cquote|During my time at Everton, Goodison Park came to feel like a second home, with the supporters of the club, and the people of [[Liverpool|the city]] becoming a second family to me. If you were to take Everton out of the city, I firmly believe the club could no longer call itself the "People's Club" and I give my whole-hearted support to the campaign to keep Everton in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/sport/2007/04/05/ex-everton-icon-backs-battle-to-keep-club-in-city-64375-18861853/|title=Ex-Everton icon backs battle to keep club in city|date=5 April 2007|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|access-date=2009-02-09}}</ref>}}
