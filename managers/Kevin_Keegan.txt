Keegan began his playing career at [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] in 1968, before [[Bill Shankly]] signed him for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. There, he won three [[Football League First Division|First Division]] titles, the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] twice, the [[FA Cup]] and, in his final season, the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. During this period, he was a regular member of the [[England national football team|England national team]], and captained the team on 31 occasions, including at [[UEFA Euro 1980]]. He moved to [[Hamburger SV]] in the summer of 1977 and was named [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] in both 1978 and 1979.<ref>{{Cite web |date=20 August 2023 |title=Worst Ballon d'Or Winners In Football History, Revealed {{!}} Football Stories |work=Football Stories |url=http://footballstories.co.uk/worst-ballon-dor-winners-in-football-history-revealed/ |access-date=21 August 2023 |language=en-US |archive-date=21 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230821212841/http://footballstories.co.uk/worst-ballon-dor-winners-in-football-history-revealed/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Hamburg won the [[Bundesliga]] title in the [[1978–79 Bundesliga|1978–79 season]] and reached the [[1980 European Cup final]]. Keegan left Hamburg and played at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] for two seasons, before transferring to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1982. He helped Newcastle secure promotion in his second season, and retired from playing in 1984. He scored 204 goals in 592 appearances in his club career, adding 21 goals in 63 caps for the England national team.

Keegan moved into management at Newcastle in 1992, and the team won promotion to the [[Premier League]] as First Division champions in his first full season, the following year. Newcastle finished second in the Premier League in the 1995–96 season, despite leading the way for most of the campaign. After managing [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] for two seasons, he took charge of the England national team in February 1999. However, he resigned in October 2000, following a 1–0 loss against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in qualification for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 9|2002 FIFA World Cup]]. In 2001, he became manager of [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for four years, until he resigned in 2005. Keegan had been out of football for almost three years when he returned to Newcastle for a second spell as manager in January 2008. However, this lasted only eight months, as he resigned in September, following speculation about a dispute with the club's directors.<ref name=quit>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/7593683.stm|title= Keegan resigns as Newcastle boss |access-date=4 September 2008|publisher=BBC Sport | date=4 September 2008}}</ref> He has the unique distinction of being [[promotion and relegation|promoted]] as champions in his first full season with the three clubs he managed.

==Early years==
[[File:FrankKeegan1909.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Keegan's grandfather Frank Keegan]]
Keegan's paternal ancestors arrived in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] from Ireland.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 380–381}} In 1909, his grandfather Frank, an inspector, heroically saved lives in the [[West Stanley Pit disaster]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 362–380}} His father Joe and uncle Frank were [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] supporters,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 311–317}} describing their favourite players as [[Hughie Gallacher]] and [[Jackie Milburn]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 312}} His father moved to [[Armthorpe]] near [[Doncaster]] (then in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]) to work in a colliery,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 381–382}} where he married Doris{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 324}} and they had three children: Mary, who was two years Keegan's senior,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 407}} Kevin, and Michael.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 352}} His father never saw Keegan play for Newcastle.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 325–326}}

Keegan was born in February 1951 at his aunt Nellie's house in Elm Place in Armthorpe, as she had electricity that made it safer for childbirth.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 385–386}} Keegan attended St. Peter's High School in nearby [[Cantley, South Yorkshire|Cantley]].<ref name = FATS>{{cite book |last1=Chalk |first1=Gary|last2=Holley|first2=Duncan |last3=Bull|first3=David |title=All the Saints: A Complete Players' Who's Who of Southampton FC|year=2013|location=Southampton|publisher=Hagiology Publishing| isbn=978-0-9926-8640-6|page=367}}</ref>

Keegan was given his first football by his uncle Frank and his first pair of football boots by his father after he won betting on horses.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 315-316}} They were a second-hand pair of Winit boots bought from a sports shop run by former [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] centre forward [[Ray Harrison]]. Keegan played football at Hyde Park using his baby brother Michael's pushchair as a goal post.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 460}} As a boy, he supported [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]. His favourite player was [[Alick Jeffrey]], a player once described by [[Matt Busby]]'s assistant, [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]], as the English [[Pelé]], and once described by Milburn as "the best young player he had ever seen".{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 272–280}} As a schoolboy, Keegan had a trial for [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] under manager [[Jimmy Hill]]. Despite being one of two players kept on for an extra six-week period, the club did not offer Keegan a contract. They did offer apprenticeship terms to the right-back [[Brian Joy]], who went on to have a 15-year career in football.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 492–513}} Keegan had another trial with Doncaster Rovers arranged by his father, but when Keegan arrived he found out he had the wrong information — the trial was earlier in the day and at a different place.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 486}}

Keegan participated in various sports, such as cross country running, rugby, and football, and served his school's cricket team as captain.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 508–509}} He also boxed at his local club, run by the former British Heavyweight champion [[Bruce Woodcock (boxer)|Bruce Woodcock]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1345}} At age 15, Keegan and two friends completed a 50-mile run from [[Nottingham]] to [[Doncaster]]. In his autobiography, Keegan claimed this run prepared him physically and psychologically for any running he had to do in future pre-season training or football matches.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 636–650}} Keegan left school with [[GCE Ordinary Level|O Levels]] in History and Art.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 511}}

At the age of 15, Keegan started working at [[Pegler Yorkshire|Pegler Brass Works]] as an office clerk, though he has said he was more of a tea boy and messenger than a clerk.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 512}} Whilst working at Pegler, Keegan played Saturday afternoon football for his local youth club, Enfield House, and Sunday morning football for the Lonsdale Hotel.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 518}} It was during this time that a colleague named Harry Holland invited him to play for the Peglers Works reserves.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 521}} His chance at professional football came when he was playing Sunday morning league football for the Lonsdale Hotel in a match against Woodfield Social in 1966. Keegan was marked by an older player named Bob Nellis, who was so impressed by the ability of Keegan that he offered him a trial at [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] side [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] — one of just two professional sides in the division. This trial would lead to the Scunthorpe manager [[Ron Ashman]] giving Keegan his first contract in professional football.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 530–543}}<ref name="bbcsport"/>{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53–82}}

==Club career==
===1966–1971: Scunthorpe United===
[[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] could not afford a set of football nets and trained on a rugby pitch at [[Quibell Park Stadium|Quibell Park]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 582}} They also had five-a-side training sessions on the [[Old Show Ground]] concrete car park.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 586}} Keegan took training very seriously, twice a week training with teammate Derek Hemstead by doing weighted [[Strength athletics#Common disciplines|farmers walk]]s up and down the cantilever stand at the Old Show Ground.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 657}} In running drills at Scunthorpe, Keegan liked trying to finish first and was told by coach [[Jack Brownsword]] that one thing he had going for him was that he was a "one-hundred percenter" and he should never lose that.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 652}} This will to be first in his running drills would later irritate senior professionals such as [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]'s [[Tommy Smith (footballer, born 1945)|Tommy Smith]],{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 650}} and [[Bill Shankly]] would later advise Keegan that he did not have to win all his runs.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 649}}

Scunthorpe did not have the funds for a full-time driver to drive them to away games, so Keegan and the other younger players would take turns in driving the minibus to and from away games.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 578}} Keegan, Nigel Jackson, Jimmy Coyne, Alan Olbison and Steve Hibbotson once borrowed Brownsword's stopwatch and had timed rallies around the Old Show Ground with the club's vintage tractor.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} On Keegan's turn, the tractor crashed and the tractor's axle went through the engine.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 609}} The crash was very expensive to fix and the five players were harshly reprimanded by manager [[Ron Ashman]]. This experience gave Keegan awareness of his responsibility as a representative of Scunthorpe United. In 1968, Keegan made his debut against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] at the age of 17, and went on to make 29 league starts in his first season.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 660}} He became a regular in the first team by the [[1969–70 in English football|1969–70 season]], playing all 46 league games for the club.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 661}} That season saw the team reach the fifth round of the [[FA Cup]], beating [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] along the way. His low wages at Scunthorpe meant Keegan had to find summer jobs, such as plate-laying at the [[Scunthorpe Steelworks|Appleby Frodingham Steelworks]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 600}}

{{external media | float = right | width = 300px | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/embed/S_KSWseOaaE?start=32&end=127 Keegan interviewed during the 1969–70 season]}} Keegan played regularly in a [[playmaker|creative]] [[right midfield]] role for the Scunthorpe first team, scoring 18 goals in 124 games for the club. After his first season, he started attracting interest from higher division clubs. In a rare televised interview at Scunthorpe during the 1969–70 season, Keegan tried to play down the interest, stating: "I'm getting first-team football here. Should think if I went First Division, I'd struggle a bit."{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 665}} Not long after this interview, Keegan began to feel impatient about playing in higher divisions and even considered quitting the game and getting a full-time job.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 667–672}} Higher division clubs such as [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] all showed interest in Keegan but nothing came of it.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 677}}

===1971–1977: Liverpool===
[[File:FC Zürich against Liverpool - Kevin Keegan.jpg|thumb|Keegan (left) walking out for a game against [[FC Zürich]] in 1977]]
In 1971, Keegan attracted the attention of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]'s head scout [[Geoff Twentyman]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2009/08/07/liverpool-fc-super-scout-geoff-twentyman-s-secret-diary-revealed-100252-24338468/|title=Liverpool FC super-scout Geoff Twentyman's secret diary revealed| first= Tony |last = Barret| date = 7 August 2009|access-date=29 April 2011|newspaper=Liverpool Echo}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Secret Diary of a Liverpool Scout| first=Simon |last=Hughes| date = 6 August 2009|publisher=Trinity Mirror Sport Media}}</ref> whose opinion was held in high regard by manager [[Bill Shankly]]. After Twentyman's recommendation, Liverpool made an offer for Keegan which Scunthorpe accepted. After Scunthorpe agreed to the fee offered, Keegan was driven the four hours to Liverpool by manager [[Ron Ashman]], who was determined to get a cash influx for the club.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 729–737}} Prior to the journey, Keegan's father advised Keegan to not sell himself cheap.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 738}} Keegan negotiated a contract worth £50 a week after Shankly had originally offered him £45. Ashman, sensing the deal may fall through, was at one stage aghast at Keegan's negotiation tactics. On the drive back to Scunthorpe, Ashman was critical of Keegan's bluff that he was earning almost £45 a week at a Fourth Division club. After the negotiation, 20-year-old Keegan was transferred to Liverpool for a fee of £33,000.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53–82}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccer-fans-info.com/kevin-keegan.html|title=Kevin Keegan Biography|access-date=28 July 2008|publisher=soccer-fans-info.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916201600/http://www.soccer-fans-info.com/kevin-keegan.html|archive-date=16 September 2008}}</ref>

Liverpool bought Keegan as a midfielder, but Shankly soon decided to move Keegan up front alongside [[John Toshack]]. In a reserve match against [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]], Keegan played right midfield, and after playing with an attacking mindset he was strongly warned by [[Ronnie Moran]] that he was "playing too free and easy," and "nearly playing up front."{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 793–799}} Keegan took Moran's criticism as a slight, and for a period perceived that Moran strongly had it in for him.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 800}} As a result of Keegan's lack of positional discipline, he was tested up front in a preseason reserve match against [[Southport F.C.|Southport]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 802}} Keegan scored both goals in a 2–1 victory observed by Shankly. Liverpool then tried Keegan in attack at [[Melwood]] in a game between the first team and reserves.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 803}} Keegan played for the first team and scored four in a 7–0 victory.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 806}} His attacking ability prompted Shankly to keep Keegan up front, and he was immediately deployed as the new strike partner for Toshack.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 793–815}}<ref name="lfc">{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/past-players/kevin-keegan|title=Past Player Profile: Kevin Keegan|access-date=10 August 2014|publisher=Liverpool F.C.}}</ref> Though Keegan liked Toshack as a teammate, they did not socialise off the pitch, and Keegan said it was strange how quickly they could understand each other's play styles. Keegan claimed that the only other player who reached that level of football understanding with him was England international [[Trevor Brooking]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 869–875}} On 14 August 1971, Keegan made his Liverpool debut against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] at [[Anfield]], scoring after 12 minutes.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=83–118}} 

In the [[1972–73 in English football|1972–73 season]], Keegan won his first major titles. As the season was coming to a close, Liverpool was in a tight race with [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for the top spot in the First Division. [[Don Revie]]'s Leeds squad visited Anfield for a showdown on [[Easter Monday]]. Two plays on either side of halftime decided the match. First, Leeds' [[Peter Lorimer]] missed an open goal just before halftime. Two minutes after the break, [[Peter Cormack]] scored to put Liverpool ahead. Keegan added a late second goal to seal the win. Arsenal dropped a point at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], and Liverpool clinched the title with a 0–0 draw against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in the final game. This was their first major trophy since 1966.<ref name="eighth">{{Cite web |url=http://www2.liverpoolfc.tv/history/timeline/1970-1995/eighth-league-title-secured |title=Eighth league title secured |publisher=Liverpool F.C.|access-date=20 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025131702/http://www2.liverpoolfc.tv/history/timeline/1970-1995/eighth-league-title-secured |archive-date=25 October 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], Liverpool reached the [[1973 UEFA Cup final|final]], where they would face German side [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]]. The first leg at Anfield was abandoned after 27 minutes due to a downpour and rescheduled for the next day. The 27 minutes they played gave Shankly an insight into Mönchengladbach's defensive vulnerability in the air. To exploit this, he brought tall forward Toshack into the starting team, demoting the smaller [[Brian Hall (footballer, born 1946)|Brian Hall]], who appeared only as a late substitute.<ref name=lfcprofile>{{Cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/history/past-players/brian-hall|title=Brian Hall|publisher=Liverpool F.C.}}</ref> Keegan scored two goals set up by Toshack headers in a 3–0 win. Liverpool lost the second leg 2–0 away, winning the title 3–2 on [[aggregate score|aggregate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=1972/overview/|title=Reds reach European goal|access-date=10 August 2014|publisher=[[UEFA]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820061025/http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season%3D1972/overview/|archive-date=20 August 2014}}</ref>

Keegan was a frequent scorer the following season, but Liverpool lost the league title to a Leeds team that went unbeaten for a then-record 29 games at the start of the season. The team was more successful in the [[FA Cup]]. Their campaign in the competition started with a match against the club which had rejected Keegan, Doncaster Rovers, and it was Keegan who scored both Liverpool goals in a 2–2 draw. Liverpool won the replay and advanced. Keegan scored twice more on the way to the cup finals at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], including a lob-volley over the head of [[Peter Shilton]] in the semi-final against Leicester City at [[Villa Park]].

In the [[1974 FA Cup final|1974 final]], Liverpool played [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. Keegan explained Liverpool players were motivated by trash-talk from Newcastle's [[Malcolm Macdonald]] and [[John Tudor (footballer)|John Tudor]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 967–989}} Macdonald and Tudor gave pre-game interviews confidently proclaiming superiority over Liverpool and criticising older Liverpool professionals like [[Tommy Smith (footballer, born 1945)|Tommy Smith]]. Keegan also believed Shankly may have got into the heads of the Newcastle players when, on the night before the game, Shankly and Newcastle manager [[Joe Harvey (footballer)|Joe Harvey]] were being interviewed. Shankly was audible off-camera, stating, "Joe looks a bag of nerves..." Keegan explained it would not have surprised him if this was not an accident, and that Shankly did this to neutralise Newcastle's confidence. In the final, Keegan scored two as Liverpool beat Newcastle 3–0.<ref name=Kkeegan201103>{{cite web|last=Keegan|first=Kevin|title=Liverpool v Newcastle| publisher=shortlist.com|date=9 March 2011|url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/article/1098/liverpool-v-newcastle|access-date=9 March 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311120510/http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/article/1098/liverpool-v-newcastle|archive-date=11 March 2011}}</ref> It was the first brace in an FA Cup final since [[Mike Trebilcock]] scored twice for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 1966. Keegan claimed that with 100,000 people in attendance, the non-stop chanting of both sets of supporters, and the millions watching on television, this game was "as close to a non-drug-induced psychedelic experience as he could ever get".{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 967–989}}

Keegan's next visit to Wembley was three months later in the [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]], the traditional curtain raiser to a new season. The match was contentious and turned violent. Leeds midfielder [[Johnny Giles]] punched an unsuspecting Keegan, but was spared sending off after Keegan asked the referee to be lenient. Giles later lunged two-footed at Keegan. Upon Keegan's outraged reaction, [[Billy Bremner]] challenged Keegan, who then exploded and punched Bremner. Bremner punched back, and they were both sent off, the first time anyone had been sent off in a Charity Shield match.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1094–1178}} Both players removed their shirts in protest, with Keegan vocally outraged by the decision. Inside the Liverpool dressing room, Bremner approached Keegan to apologise and was met by the fury of Keegan's father who had come down to check on his son. The fight was shown that night on the [[BBC]]. Keegan and Bremner were fined £500 each, with Keegan being suspended for three games and Bremner eight.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53–82}} Despite this, Keegan, Bremner and Giles remained good friends outside of football.

The next year saw Keegan score 12 goals for Liverpool, but the [[1974–75 in English football|1974–75 season]] was a trophyless season. There were numerous honours for Keegan over the next two years, however, as Liverpool again won the League championship and UEFA Cup in the [[1975–76 in English football|1975–76 season]]. Keegan scored in both legs of the [[1976 UEFA Cup final|UEFA Cup final]] against [[Club Brugge KV|FC Bruges]], which Liverpool won 4–3 on aggregate.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53–82}}

In the [[1976–77 Liverpool F.C. season|1976–77 season]], Keegan helped Liverpool win the League championship and [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. Midway through the season, he announced his intention to leave Liverpool in the summer to play abroad. He scored 20 goals in his final season with the club. Keegan's last appearance in a Liverpool shirt on home soil was Liverpool's loss in the [[1977 FA Cup final|FA Cup final]] to bitter rivals [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53–82}} The [[1977 European Cup final|European Cup final]] in [[Rome]] against Borussia Mönchengladbach was four days later. Keegan did not score, but he did make a late run which led to a foul inside the penalty area by [[Berti Vogts]]. This led to a penalty which was successfully converted by [[Phil Neal]], sealing a 3–1 win. During the season, on 4 December 1976, Keegan's father died of cancer at the age of 71.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 352}}

After 323 appearances and 100 goals, Keegan left Liverpool. He had offers from clubs across Europe, and chose to join [[Hamburger SV]] in the West German [[Bundesliga]] for £500,000. Liverpool replaced him with [[Kenny Dalglish]].{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=53–82}} Of his time in [[Liverpool]], Keegan later said, "The only thing I fear is missing an open goal in front of the [[Anfield#Structures and facilities|Kop]]. I would die if that were to happen. When they start singing "[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]" my eyes start to water. There have been times when I've actually been crying while I've been playing."<ref name=PoolQuotes>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/lfc_story/quotes.htm |title=Liverpool FC Quotes |access-date=10 January 2007 |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107050826/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/lfc_story/quotes.htm |archive-date=7 January 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===1977–1980: Hamburger SV===
[[File:Kevin Keegan with Fan at HSV game.JPG|thumb|upright|Keegan with a [[Hamburger SV]] supporter in [[London]] in 1996]]
Keegan's transfer to [[Hamburger SV]] was agreed between the FA Cup final and the European Cup final of 1977, although Keegan had negotiated a maximum transfer fee the season before.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=119–146}} The agreement set the British record transfer record at £500,000,{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1192}} and nearly doubled the German transfer record.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1247}} Keegan arrived in Germany, joining a club that had not finished higher than sixth in two decades.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1202}} He told [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s [[Brian Moore (commentator)|Brian Moore]] that his annual salary the last season he played for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] was £22,000, whereas at Hamburg it was £122,000.<ref name="moore">{{Citation |title=Brian Moore Meets Kevin Keegan (1979) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0m5ySe0-Og |language=en |access-date=10 December 2022}}</ref>

Following his move to Hamburg, Keegan became an early trendsetter with his new haircut, a perm. On first sight, his wife thought it was hilarious and his agent jokingly tried to disown him in public.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1283–1298}} Soon though, players such as [[Bryan Robson]], [[Charlie George]], [[Phil Neal]], [[Terry McDermott]] also had perms.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1283-1298}} Later, when Keegan was at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] as a manager, he and McDermott would joke about the perm in an advertisement.<ref name=natKitCommercial>{{Citation | first1 = Kevin| last1 = Keegan | first2 = Terry| last2 = McDermott |authorlink2= Terry McDermott | first3 = Alan |last3 = Shearer |authorlink3= Alan Shearer | year = 1996 | title = Newcastle United - Adidas kit supplier commercials | place = United Kingdom| publisher = Adidas }}</ref> Keegan became Hamburg's best-paid player and was billed by the club's business manager, Dr. Peter Krohn, as the superstar signing from England who would transform an average German team.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1245}} Keegan did not feel immediately accepted by his new teammates, and perceived slights from teammates that supported this idea, like making an open run in training but not receiving a pass.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1244}}{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1248–1253}}

Rules stated that no club was allowed more than two foreign players on its squad. Unbeknownst to Keegan, his transfer had indirectly moved out the three-time European Cup winner [[Horst Blankenburg]]. Blankenburg was a very popular member of the squad, and this upset some players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1260}} There was also some resentment among the other players who thought that the previous coach, whom the players liked, was replaced by Krohn to accommodate Keegan.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1263–1267}} It was not until Keegan had moved out of temporary accommodation and moved to a bungalow in the little village of [[Itzstedt]] that Keegan began to feel he could make inroads and have a successful career and life in Germany.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1278}}

In one early interview, Keegan mentioned how he was settling in, he explained how he missed British cereals that he could not find in the supermarkets in Germany. The Hamburg supporters then flooded him with parcels of his favourite cereal with lists of the suppliers.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1321–1324}} There were language difficulties early on. In one instance in the summer, Keegan went into a hardware shop intending to buy a fuse and he eventually left the shop after buying Christmas lights.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1314}}

He scored in pre-season friendlies against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and his former club Liverpool, but Hamburg would later suffer defeat in the [[UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup]] [[1977 European Super Cup|final]] against the latter opposition. Keegan's time in Hamburg got off to a bad start as Hamburg lost 5–2 to [[MSV Duisburg]] in their first league match. [[Rudi Gutendorf]], the manager some believed was appointed for Keegan, would only last until October.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1299–1305}}

In the winter break of his first season, feeling isolated by the clique in the dressing room, a frustrated Keegan was sent off in a friendly against lower league club [[VfB Lübeck]].{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=147–172}}{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1332–1368}} A player in the match was targeting Keegan, and after the third time being smashed, Keegan walked to the goading Lübeck player and punched him. Keegan, who knew he was going to be sent off, walked off the pitch prior to any decision by the referee. Keegan maintains this was his lowest point in Germany. After the incident, he decided to master the German language to fully integrate himself in the team. Up to this point, he did not have the language to ask teammates why they were not passing to him, nor to show them that he too loved the club.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1332–1368}}

Keegan was suspended for eight weeks and in that time he and the squad made efforts to integrate.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1376–1378}} He knew the dressing room was turning in his favour when he got invited to the squad nights out. Eventually, one player told him he could get cheap meat for Keegan's dogs, and full-back [[Peter Hidien]] even got a perm. An unhappy first few months at the club gave way to a more successful season. Although the club finished tenth in the league in the [[1977–78 Bundesliga|1977–78 season]], Keegan's 12 goals helped him pick up a personal honour, the ''[[France Football]]'' [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] award for 1978.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=147–172}}<ref name=FF>{{cite web|url=http://www.francefootball.fr/ballon-d-or/Ballon_Or_2011/palmares.php|title=Ballon d'or|access-date=10 August 2014|publisher=France Football|language=fr|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812204919/http://www.francefootball.fr/ballon-d-or/Ballon_Or_2011/palmares.php|archive-date=12 August 2014}}</ref>

Hamburg appointed Croatian [[Branko Zebec]] as a new coach.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1381}} Zebec was a man who was known to work players to the max. Zebec's squad did a lot of running and Keegan claimed he had never been worked as hard in his life.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1386}} The [[1978–79 Bundesliga|1978–79 season]] saw a vast improvement on the club's 1978 finish. A rigorous training regime, Keegan's increasing grasp of the [[German language]], and the newly imposed discipline contributed to Hamburg's first league championship in nineteen years.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=147–172}} The club's success also translated into individual recognition for Keegan, who picked up the European Footballer of the Year award for a second consecutive season.<ref name=FF/> Before Keegan, only [[Alfredo di Stéfano]], [[Franz Beckenbauer]] and [[Johan Cruyff]] had won the award two or more times.<ref name=fballerYear1979>{{cite news | last =Guardian staff | title = Previous winners of the European Footballer of the Year | newspaper = The Guardian| location = United Kingdom| language = en| date = 16 December 2002| url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/dec/16/newsstory.sport10| access-date = 22 May 2019}}</ref> As of 2023, six more players have won the award multiple times, bringing the total to ten.

After the 1978–79 season, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] and the [[Washington Diplomats]] tried to sign Keegan by offering good terms, but he decided to see out his contract at Hamburg.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1432–1438}} In 1979, Hamburg supporters gave Keegan the nickname "Mighty Mouse" from the [[Mighty Mouse|popular cartoon superhero]] from the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="mouse"/>

In February 1980, Keegan announced he was leaving after his contract expired. One of the reasons for leaving was Zebec's training regime. Keegan had a lot of respect for Zebec, but thought that Zebec's extreme fitness regime was flawed for the modern-day footballer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1522–1527}} Keegan told Zebec that his training regime was going to burn him out as a footballer, and that he believed he would be finished from playing by 30 if he continued. Zebec, in turn responded to Keegan's critique and explained to Keegan it was the same for all the players. Keegan then implied to Zebec that players have different roles and not all players run the same distances on match days; he pointed out to Zebec that because of his role and his effort, on match days not many players in the squad ran as much as himself. After he left the club, drawings were found in Keegan's training ground locker depicting Zebec treating the squad as prisoners, with a figure of Keegan counting down the days to his release. The drawings and Keegan's personal locker are now held in the Hamburg Museum, under the title "HSV Legenden".{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1522}}

Hamburg's [[1979–80 European Cup|European campaign of 1979–80]] saw Keegan score two goals to help Hamburg past [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]], the Soviet champions who had beaten Liverpool to advance. On the run Hamburg beat Dinamo Tbilisi, [[Valur (club)|Valur]], [[Hajduk Split]] and [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1471–1497}} In the first leg against Madrid, they were comfortably beaten 2–0 and most football pundits predicted Hamburg were probably going out. Hamburg beat the odds by winning the return leg 5–1. Keegan regarded this as one of the most outstanding team performances he had the fortune to be a part of. In the [[1980 European Cup final|final]], they played [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. Forest won the game 1–0 with a goal from [[John Robertson (footballer, born 1953)|John Robertson]]. This cup final defeat was coupled domestically with losing the [[1979–80 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] title to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. Having negotiated a maximum transfer fee of £500,000 in his contract the year before and agreeing to a move in February, Keegan left Hamburg for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the summer of 1980.{{sfnp|Keegan|1998|pp=173–191}}

===1980–1982: Southampton===
On 11 February 1980, [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] boss [[Lawrie McMenemy]] called a press conference at the Potters Heron Hotel in [[Ampfield]] to announce that Keegan would join the ''Saints'' in the summer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1559–1573}} The news caused surprise throughout the world of football and around the city of [[Southampton]], as they were a relatively small club.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Osman |first=Luke |date=29 April 2020 |title=When Southampton signed the two-time Ballon d'Or winner Kevin Keegan – and no-one knew about it |url=https://thesefootballtimes.co/2020/04/29/when-southampton-signed-the-two-time-ballon-dor-winner-kevin-keegan-and-no-one-knew-about-it/ |access-date=16 September 2024 |website=These Football Times}}</ref> The club was beginning to become established in the top division, but this signing showed how persuasive their manager could be.<ref name=":0" /> Supporters' excitement only grew when Keegan captained England at [[UEFA Euro 1980]] in Italy.

Keegan had a clause in his contract with Hamburg that gave [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] the option to buy him back.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1562}} Liverpool, however, opted not to exercise this clause. As late as November 2011, Keegan has stated, "I was with Lawrie [McMenemy] at a charity event the other day, and he said he phoned up Peter Robinson because he wanted me, but Liverpool had a clause. Peter said, 'No, we won't be signing him, definitely, we don't need him.'" Southampton snapped him up for £420,000, and Keegan made his Southampton debut at [[Lansdowne Road]] in a pre-season friendly against [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] on 23 July 1980.

Keegan's two seasons at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]] saw him as part of a flamboyant team also containing [[Alan Ball Jr.|Alan Ball]], [[Phil Boyer]], [[Mick Channon]] and [[Charlie George]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1557–1559}} In [[1980–81 in English football|1980–81]], the ''Saints'' scored 76 goals, finishing in sixth place, their highest league finish to that point.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}}

In the following season, Keegan played some of his best football, and at the beginning of April 1982, Southampton sat at the top of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] table.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1619}} They managed only three wins after February, however, leading to a seventh-place finish, 21 points off first place.<ref>{{cite book | first1=Duncan |last1=Holley |first2=Gary |last2=Chalk | title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |page=167}}</ref> Despite this, Keegan was voted the [[PFA Player of the Year]] and awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to Association Football. Keegan had scored 26 of the team's 72 league goals and was voted the club's [[Southampton F.C. – Player of the Season|Player of the Season]] by the ''[[Southern Daily Echo]]''.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1647–1648}} This second season was the most prolific of his career, scoring 30 goals in all competitions and winning the golden boot.

Keegan fell out with McMenemy over the manager's failure to strengthen Southampton's defence (which conceded 67 goals in the [[1981–82 in English football|1981–82 season]]) while the team was at the top of the table.<ref>{{cite book | first=Jeremy |last=Wilson | title=Southampton's Cult Heroes| publisher=Know The Score Books | year=2006|pages=150–151| isbn= 1-905449-01-1}}</ref> There were also rumours that McMenemy had accused the whole team of cheating after a 3–0 defeat by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in April 1982, to which Keegan took great exception.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1663–1673}} Although Keegan joined the ''Saints''{{'}} next pre–season tour, he had already decided to move. In 2019, McMenemy explained that prior to the start of the 1982–83 season, Keegan believed that Southampton did not match his footballing ambitions, he had made up his mind and demanded to leave, and there was nothing the club could do about it.<ref name=KeeganLeavesSouthampton82>{{cite news | last = McMenemy | first = Lawrie |authorlink=Lawrie McMenemy | title = Kevin Keegan reunion rekindled 1980s memories| newspaper = Southern Daily Echo |location = Hampshire | date = 9 June 2019| url = https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/17694061.kevin-keegan-reunion-rekindled-1980s-memories/}}</ref> A few days before the start of the season, he signed for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for a fee of £100,000.<ref>{{Cite web |date=5 September 2008 |title=Kevin Keegan factfile |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/02/newcastleunited.premierleague1 |access-date=16 September 2024 |website=The Guardian}}</ref>

===1982–1984: Newcastle United===
Keegan joined [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and spent two seasons there, during which time he was extremely popular with the supporters. The press conference to announce his signing was held in the Gosforth Park Hotel.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=1941}} Reacting to the two-time Ballon d'Or winner joining a Second Division team, a local newspaper's main headline was simply, "Here he is!"{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1943}}

Keegan always felt at one stage in his career he would play for Newcastle.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1951}} As a child, Keegan's father would tell him football stories about [[Hughie Gallacher]] and [[Jackie Milburn]]. Keegan claimed that his father would have loved to have seen him playing football in black and white stripes, and to Keegan, playing for Newcastle felt like coming home.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1938–1948}} There was euphoria in Newcastle at the signing of Keegan and he felt he was there to help the supporters to start believing in themselves.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1952–1965}} Keegan had never experienced that kind of deification before. He explained, no one could have made him more welcome.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1964}} People had warned Keegan that whatever he was thinking his welcome would be like, it would not be enough.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1971–1975}} To Keegan, who had played in a European Cup final, Wembley and Hamburg, the atmosphere on his debut was unique, explaining that the noise on his debut came from all sides of the ground like a surround sound system. He made his debut and scored his first goal against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. After scoring, Keegan did something he had never done before — he instinctively and famously threw himself into the crowd to show the supporters he was one of them.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1952–1965}} He explained to the press afterwards that "I just wanted to stay there for ever..."{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 1965–1967}} Keegan had a fear of letting the supporters down, constantly telling himself, "You can't let them down."{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 1976}}

Keegan, along with [[Terry McDermott]], [[Jeff Clarke (English footballer)|Jeff Clarke]] and [[David McCreery]], now had senior status at the club. Newcastle manager, [[Arthur Cox (footballer)|Arthur Cox]], who would later join many of Keegan's coaching staffs, had a different relationship to Keegan than with other players. Cox would ask Keegan his opinion on players.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2042–2046}} To Keegan, Cox was a task master with a good sense of humour.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2036}} Cox would condition the players like commandos by having Keegan and his teammates running up and down the hills in [[Gateshead]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2047–2051}} In his first season, Newcastle finished fifth, which Keegan maintained was a "flattering" league position, after a faltering season.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2042}} He finished the season with 21 goals in 37 appearances and won North East Player of the Year.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2045}}

In September 1983, Keegan answered a phone call at 1:00 am from Cox. In the phone call Cox explained to Keegan that he had signed [[Peter Beardsley]] from the [[Vancouver Whitecaps]] and suggested that Keegan would like him. A few days later, Keegan met Beardsley at [[Benwell]]. Keegan and his teammates thought Beardsley was "just a lad who had won a competition" to train with the first team. It was only when they saw him in action that they knew he had something about him. At Beardsley's first training session Keegan could not believe his eyes. Keegan once stated about Beardsley, "At [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe]] I always thought [[Terry Heath]] had the wow factor, because of his skill on the ball, and when I moved to [[Liverpool]] I had never seen anyone with [[Peter Thompson (footballer, born 1942)|Peter Thompson]]'s ability. By the time I started playing for Newcastle, however, I had played against [[Johan Cruyff|Cruyff]], [[Maradona]] and [[Pelé]], and yet I have never had my mind blown as I did on the first day I saw Peter Beardsley."{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle locations 2076–2093}}

Keegan announced his retirement prior to the end of the [[1983–84 in English football|1983–84 season]], on 14 February 1984 — his 33rd birthday.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2137}} Keegan felt his career was finished after a cup game, a month prior, away at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. In this match, Keegan was put through on goal from a pass that left him one-on-one with the goalkeeper, [[Bruce Grobbelaar]]. He thought this was his moment to put Newcastle 1–0 up in front of the thousands of supporters behind the goal. Before he could finish his move and put the goal away, Keegan was intercepted by the recovering [[Mark Lawrenson]]. As Keegan was moving towards goal with his pace, Lawrenson caught up to him and stole the ball off him from the side. At this precise moment, it occurred to Keegan he had now lost his pace. At the end of the game, a frustrated Keegan, while clapping off the supporters, decided this would be his last season as a footballer.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2112–2134}}

Keegan felt if he were to extend his career at Newcastle in the First Division, he would have to adjust his game and move from the attacking role on which he built his footballing identity. Keegan did not want to move back into midfield, and instead decided to retire on a high note.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2137–2142}}

Keegan's last league game was against [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], scoring in a 3–1 victory. He played 78 times in his Newcastle career, scoring 48 goals and helping promote them from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1984.

===1985: Blacktown City===
In April 1985, Keegan briefly came out of retirement to play a two-game stint as a guest player for [[Blacktown City FC|Blacktown City]] in Australia's [[National Soccer League]]. He scored in the first fixture in a 3–2 loss to [[Canberra City FC|Canberra City]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Canberra City Wins Despite Keegan Magic |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/122475720|newspaper=Canberra Times | date=29 April 1985 |access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref>

==International career==
During 1972, Keegan made five appearances for the [[England national under-23 football team|England under-23 team]], with his only goal coming in a friendly match against [[East Germany national under-21 football team|East Germany]]. That same match also saw Keegan receive his only red card at international level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamPlyrsBios/PlayersK/BioKeeganJK.html|title=England Players - Kevin Keegan|website=englandfootballonline.com|access-date=2 June 2024}}</ref>

Keegan made his [[England national football team|England]] debut on 15 November 1972 in a 1–0 World Cup qualifying win over [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. Keegan managed only two appearances during this campaign, both against Wales, as England failed to qualify for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name=ES>{{Englandstats|ref=y|access-date=30 July 2008}}</ref> He scored his first international goal in his third appearance, also against Wales, on 11 May 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/england/News/2007/kevin_keegan|title=Legends: Kevin Keegan|publisher=The Football Association|access-date=10 August 2014}}</ref> He was given the captaincy by manager [[Don Revie]] in 1976 after [[Gerry Francis]] fell victim to a long-term injury. He went on to captain England 31 times, retaining the captain's armband until his international retirement after the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]].

Keegan captained England at [[UEFA Euro 1980|Euro 1980]]. England failed to progress from the group stage after finishing third in their group behind [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].

He managed only one World Cup appearance, as England failed to qualify for both the [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 5|1974]] and [[1978 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 2|1978]] tournaments. He finally reached the World Cup in 1982, held in Spain. He was named in the squad for the tournament, but was suffering from a chronic back injury and was unfit to play in any of England's group games. In a last desperate effort to play in a World Cup — knowing that he would not be around for the 1986 competition — he secretly hired a car and drove from Spain to a [[medical specialist|specialist]] he knew in Germany for intensive treatment. He recovered sufficiently to appear as a substitute for the last 26 minutes of England's second-round game against [[Spain men's national football team|Spain]]. While on the pitch, he missed a point-blank header which would have put England ahead. England needed to win by a scoreline better than 2–1 to progress to the semi-finals (a 2–1 victory would have left them tied with [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]). England drew the game 0–0 and were eliminated from the competition.

Following the successful start to the [[1982–83 in English football|1982–83 season]] with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], there was much controversy when newly appointed England manager [[Bobby Robson]] did not select Keegan for his first squad, a decision Keegan learned of from the media rather than Robson himself.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TvFtlOSX_g | title = Match of the 80s – Season 82–83 (Part 1 of 4) | via = YouTube | date = 13 July 2007 | access-date =27 August 2011}}</ref> Keegan publicly expressed his displeasure at not being given the courtesy of a phone call from Robson, and never played for his country again. He finished his international career with 63 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and 21 goals.

==Managerial career==
===Newcastle United===
On 5 February 1992, almost eight years after his final game as a player, Keegan returned to Newcastle United as manager. The club had been relegated from the top flight in 1989 and narrowly missed out on promotion in 1990 after losing in the playoffs to arch-rivals [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. In 1991, they failed to make the playoffs and occupied last place in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] at several stages. Following the dismissal of previous manager [[Ossie Ardiles]], Keegan was appointed to prevent Newcastle from being relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|third tier]] for the first time in the club's history. The club was suffering from internal struggles and boardroom battles which were holding them back. After three or more years trying, [[John Hall (English businessman)|John Hall]] had recently won the board room from the old regime. Though Hall was not yet confirmed as the chairman, he had accrued enough power to make the key decisions. Hall told board members one hour before Keegan's first press conference that he would be the manager.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2302–2314}} Keegan had watched only two live matches in seven years. One was the [[1991 European Cup final|European Cup final in 1991]], the other being a goalless draw between Newcastle and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]; as such, it was suggested that Keegan was unprepared and inexperienced.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2323–2341}}

When Keegan turned up to [[Benwell]] for his first training session as manager, he noted the training ground was in a mess. He was surprised at the neglect of the facilities.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2353–2374}} The training ground was in the process of being sold; despite this, Keegan paid for the clean-up of the grounds with his own money, with the cleaning work being done in one weekend. Keegan felt this clean-up work was an important move and an indirect message to the players that their professionalism had to be high.

Assessing the squad, Keegan felt the team was not good enough to reach the level at which he and [[Terry McDermott]] once played.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2380–2400}} In five-a-sides he and McDermott, both in their 40s with a lack of conditioning, believed they were two of the best players. Keegan noted the club had an impressive crop of youth players. This crop included: [[Lee Clark (footballer)|Lee Clark]], [[Steve Watson]], [[Steve Howey (footballer)|Steve Howey]], [[Alan Thompson (footballer, born 1973)|Alan Thompson]] and [[Robbie Elliott]]. These young players would form the core of Keegan's Newcastle squads from 1992 to 1997. Keegan noted Watson would take throw-ins via a somersault throw and this amused and shocked him. He regarded it as a gimmick and could not believe the club's supporters would take joy in it. The throw-in, to Keegan, was a sign of how far Newcastle had fallen.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2478–2485}} He wanted the club to be known for scoring goals and thrilling football. Prior to his first game, Keegan made his first tough call with his squad of players when he dropped Clark.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2400–2405}} Though he liked Clark's spirit, Keegan believed he was at risk of being sent off. Prior to the game, Keegan arranged a training match for the reserves and included himself to make up the numbers.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2403–2415}} In the training match, a frustrated Clark went through the back of Keegan in a knee-high tackle on a [[hospital pass]], in a similar way to a [[Romeo Benetti]] tackle on Keegan in an [[England national football team|England]]–[[Italy national football team|Italy]] match. A melee ensued, resulting in [[Pavel Srníček]] swinging a roundhouse kick at Clark's head. Keegan was not upset and he did not punish either player. To Keegan, Srníček and Clark's response showed they cared about their football. Keegan's first game, against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], ended in 3–0 victory in front of a capacity crowd.

On 14 March 1992, following a 3–1 win over [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], Keegan became frustrated with Hall.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2430–2452}} Keegan had been not given the transfer funds he was promised. As a result of this frustration, Keegan briefly walked out on the team. This resulted in a phone call between Keegan and Hall, where they settled their differences, and where Hall guaranteed millions of pounds to spend on new players.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Turnbull|first1=Simon|title=Welcome to the North-east... Football's land of plenty|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/welcome-to-the-north-east-footballs-land-of-plenty-1309974.html|access-date=15 March 2017|work=The Independent|date=15 August 1996}}</ref> Further assessing his squad, Keegan noted some players could not handle the pressure and would sneak in by a turnstile rather than meet and greet the big crowds at the front entrance prior to games.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2485–2488}} Keegan decided to move these players on. With the club's transfer funds Keegan decided he needed a leader in the team.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 2495–2501}} Keegan signed the experienced [[Brian Kilcline]]. Keegan stated about Kilcline, "Even on his bad days his head never dropped, he was tough as teak, absolutely fearless", and "He was a ready-made captain, one of my more important signings as Newcastle's manager." Keegan's managerial guidance in the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92 season]] helped Newcastle finish 20th out of 24 teams in the Second Division, avoiding relegation. This meant, with the establishment of the new [[Premier League]], the team would play in the new First Division for the [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93 season]].

Prior to the 1992–93 season, Keegan strengthened the defence with the acquisition of [[Barry Venison]] from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[John Beresford (footballer)|John Beresford]] from [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. Newcastle began the season with 11 successive wins and led the league virtually all season. The club-record signing of [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] striker [[Andy Cole]] in February further strengthened their side; Cole netted 12 goals in his first 12 games for the club. The addition of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]'s [[Rob Lee]] bolstered the midfield in the autumn. Newcastle finished first in the First Division, eight points clear of second-place [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], and were promoted to the Premier League as First Division champions. Top scorer [[David Kelly (association footballer)|David Kelly]] and influential midfielder [[Gavin Peacock]] were both sold after the season, and Keegan brought striker [[Peter Beardsley]] back to Newcastle from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], six years after he had been sold by Newcastle to Liverpool.

The [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94 season]] was an enormous success for Newcastle as they finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Cup, bringing European football to the club for the first time since 1977. Cole was the Premier League's top scorer with 34 goals in 40 games, and he set a club record with a total of 41 goals in all competitions. Keegan then strengthened his side by signing [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss]] defender [[Marc Hottiger]], [[Belgium national football team|Belgian]] defensive midfielder [[Philippe Albert]], and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]'s quick winger, [[Ruel Fox]].

Newcastle won their first six games of the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95 season]] to top the league and they appeared capable of winning their first league title since 1927. The shock departure of Cole to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in January weakened their attack, and they finished the season in sixth place—not enough for another UEFA Cup campaign. In the meantime, autumn signing [[Paul Kitson]] was partnered with Beardsley in attack. Keegan made several important additions to the Newcastle side in the summer of 1995: [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] goalkeeper [[Shaka Hislop]], [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]'s French winger [[David Ginola]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] striker [[Les Ferdinand]], and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] defender [[Warren Barton]]. Ferdinand was Newcastle's biggest signing at £6 million, while the £4 million paid for Barton was the highest fee paid for a defender in English football at the time.

Newcastle excelled in the first half of the [[1995–96 in English football|1995–96 season]], leading the league by ten points on 23 December 1995 and holding a 12-point lead from early in January to 4 February. After a 2–0 defeat at West Ham on 21 February, the lead was cut to nine points. A 1–0 defeat at the hands of fellow title-challengers Manchester United cut the gap to a single point on 4 March. Within two weeks, Newcastle's lead evaporated and they were unable to recover it. Newcastle's [[Liverpool F.C. 4–3 Newcastle United F.C. (1996)|4–3 defeat]] to Liverpool on 3 April is widely considered to be a classic Premier League match. With two games remaining, Newcastle and Manchester United both had 76 points. Newcastle managed a 1–1 draw against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on 2 May, and another 1–1 draw against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on the final day of the season. The title was won by Manchester United, whose 3–0 triumph at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] would have been enough to win, regardless of Newcastle's result against Tottenham. Keegan stated in 2018 that if Newcastle had won the title in that season, the squad, which included players such as Ferdinand, Ginola, Beardsley, Lee, [[Darren Peacock]], and [[Faustino Asprilla]] would have stayed together, built up momentum, and won more trophies.<ref name=etainers042018>{{cite web | url = https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/we-could-won-couple-more-14476551 | title = 'We could have won a couple more titles' – Kevin Keegan discusses Newcastle's Entertainers | last = McCormick | first = Sean | date = 2 April 2018 | work= Evening Chronicle | location = Newcastle-upon-Tyne | access-date = 2 April 2018 }}</ref>

During the race for the 1995–96 title, Keegan directed remarks at the Manchester United manager, [[Alex Ferguson]], during a post-match interview live on [[Sky Sports]]. His outburst — "I would love it if we beat them! Love it!" — is frequently referred to when describing their relationship.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.com/article/the-top-10-sporting-mismatches-cmhcjsfpfbx|title=The top 10 sporting mismatches|work=The Times|first=John|last=Aizlewood|access-date=3 December 2008|date=7 November 2004 | location=London}}</ref> In April 2003, it was named as Quote of the Decade in the [[Premier League 10 Seasons Awards]] and Most Memorable Quote in the [[Premier League 20 Seasons Awards|20 Seasons Awards]] in May 2012.

Keegan then broke the world transfer fee record by signing striker [[Alan Shearer]] from Blackburn in July 1996. Shearer, who had been the Premier League's top scorer the last two seasons, was born in Newcastle and had grown up as a fan of the club.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1996/07/30/nshear30.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312181351/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1996%2F07%2F30%2Fnshear30.html|archive-date=12 March 2005|title=Shearer is going home for £15m|first=Colin|last=Randall|access-date=21 July 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=30 July 1996|location=London|url-status=dead}}</ref> He made an instant impact on his native Tyneside. The club lost in his debut, a 4–0 Charity Shield defeat at the hands of Manchester United, but redeemed themselves two months later with a 5–0 victory against the same opposition, in which Shearer scored. Newcastle briefly led the league at several stages in the first half of the season, and Shearer led the league scoring 25 goals.<ref name=PL97>{{cite web|url=http://origin-www.premierleague.com/page/1996/97Season/0,,12306~1077104,00.html|title=Season 1996/97|access-date=10 August 2014|publisher=Premier League|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812211420/http://origin-www.premierleague.com/page/1996/97Season/0,,12306~1077104,00.html|archive-date=12 August 2014}}</ref>

On 8 January 1997, Keegan announced his resignation as manager. A club statement following his resignation read:

<blockquote>Newcastle United Football Club today announce the resignation of manager Kevin Keegan. Kevin informed the board of his wish to resign at the end of the season, having decided he no longer wishes to continue in football management at this stage in his life. Following lengthy discussions of which the board attempted to persuade Kevin to change his mind, both parties eventually agreed that the best route forward was for the club to, reluctantly, accept his resignation with immediate effect.</blockquote>

Keegan left the club with a short statement reading:<blockquote>It was my decision and my decision alone to resign. I feel I have taken the club as far as I can, and that it would be in the best interests of all concerned if I resigned now. I wish the club and everyone concerned with it all the best for the future.</blockquote>

On the Newcastle United DVD ''Magpie Magic'', it is said that chairman John Hall asked for a long-term commitment as manager from him, which Keegan was unwilling to give. It also states that the pressure and criticism of selling Cole, and the failed title challenge in the [[1995–96 in English football|1995–96 season]], took a toll on him.<ref>{{cite video|title= Newcastle United Magpie Magic|publisher=ITV DVD}}</ref>

He was succeeded by [[Kenny Dalglish]], the same man who had replaced him as a player at Liverpool 20 years earlier. Newcastle finished second place that season but 13th the following season, although they were FA Cup runners-up. They did not return to the top five of the Premier League until the [[2001–02 in English football|2001–02 season]], when they finished fourth under [[Bobby Robson]].

It was during his time as coach that Keegan gained the nickname "King Kev" from Newcastle supporters.

===Fulham===
Keegan returned to football on 25 September 1997 as chief operating officer at Second Division [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], with [[Ray Wilkins]] as head coach. Fulham finished sixth in the final table, but Wilkins was sacked just before the first leg of the playoff semi-final and Keegan took over as manager.

His appointment came a few months after the takeover of the club by [[Harrods]] owner [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]], who gave Keegan £10 million to spend on players that season. That was the first part of a £40 million attempt to deliver Premier League football to the [[Craven Cottage]] club, who had been outside the top flight since 1968, and had not played in the league's second tier since 1986.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KEV%27S+pounds+40m+SPREE%253b+Fulham+to+buy+place+at+the+top.-a061069826 | title = KEV'S pounds 40m SPREE; Fulham to buy place at the top | work = The Mirror| via = thefreelibrary.com | date = 25 September 1997 | access-date = 19 July 2012}}</ref>

Keegan was unable to inspire Fulham to overcome [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in the playoffs, but good form in the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99 season]] — helped by the acquisition of players who would normally have signed with Premier League or First Division clubs — clinched them the Second Division title and promotion to First Division. Keegan left at the end of the season to concentrate on his duties as England manager, having succeeded [[Glenn Hoddle]] in February 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-keegan-leaves-with-flea-in-his-ear-1092405.html|title=Keegan leaves with flea in his ear|work=The Independent|place=London|date=9 May 1999|access-date=10 August 2014|first=Steve|last=Tongue}}</ref>

Fulham replaced Keegan with [[Paul Bracewell]] and reached the Premier League two years later under Bracewell's successor, [[Jean Tigana]]. The squad still featured many of the players bought by Keegan or Wilkins.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-bracewell-in-the-fulham-frame-1090562.html|title=Bracewell in the Fulham frame|work=The Independent|place=London|date=30 April 1999|access-date=10 August 2014|first=Adam|last=Szreter}}</ref>

This success brought goodwill, but Keegan began to come under fire for his perceived tactical naivety. This came to a head during the unsuccessful Euro 2000 tournament. England began with a 3–2 defeat against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], despite having a 2–0 lead after 17 minutes.<ref>{{cite news |title=England crushed in five-goal classic |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/788135.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 June 2000 |access-date=10 February 2012}}</ref> England beat [[Germany national football team|Germany]] 1-0 in their next game, the first English victory over Germany in a competitive match since the 1966 World Cup final.

When [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] became England manager, he appointed the 64-year-old [[Tord Grip]] as his assistant. This caused Keegan to complain that when he was England manager, [[The Football Association|the FA]] had told him that he could not have [[Arthur Cox (footballer)|Arthur Cox]] as his assistant because at 60, Cox was too old for the role, although he was allowed a lesser role on the coaching staff. Keegan went on, "I wasn't allowed to bring in the people I wanted and that was wrong.

===Manchester City===
On 24 May 2001, Keegan returned to football as successor to [[Joe Royle]] at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], who had just been relegated from the Premier League. Keegan signed experienced international players such as [[Stuart Pearce]], [[Eyal Berkovic]] and [[Ali Benarbia]]. That season, City were promoted as [[Football League First Division|First Division]] champions after scoring 108 league goals. Keegan was the first manager in the Premier League era to win the First Division title with two different clubs.<ref name=BBC-MC>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/4338665.stm|title=Keegan ends his reign at Man City|access-date=29 August 2008|publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 March 2005}}</ref>

====Premier League Arbitration Panel====
In December 2008, it was reported that, following Mike Ashley's decision to withdraw the sale of Newcastle, a legal dispute over Keegan's departure from had arisen; Keegan claimed unfair dismissal and Ashley claimed damage to his public image.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/championship/newcastleunited/3628239/Kevin-Keegan-warned-over-suing-Newcastle-United-owner-Mike-Ashley-Football.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805020309/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/championship/newcastleunited/3628239/Kevin-Keegan-warned-over-suing-Newcastle-United-owner-Mike-Ashley-Football.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=5 August 2009 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Kevin Keegan warned over suing Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley | first=Rob | last=Stewart | date=6 December 2008 | access-date=7 May 2010}}</ref> In September 2009, it was reported that Keegan had met with Ashley and the Newcastle board — including former members — in a Premier League arbitration hearing for a claim of £10 million in compensation for his shock resignation.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.mirror.co.uk/opinion/football-opinion/kevin-keegan-right-take-mike-3372711 | title = Kevin Keegan is right to take on Mike Ashley... and it will be a victory for football should he win the case | first = Simon | last = Bird | newspaper = Daily Mirror | access-date =10 August 2014 | date = 14 September 2009}}</ref> All sides agreed to the arbitration being held publicly.<ref name=publicArb>{{cite news | last =Staff | title =Tribunal - read the full Transcript | newspaper = Northern Echo| language =English | publisher = thenorthernecho.co.uk| date = 2 October 2009 | url = https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/4662583.keegan-tribunal---read-full-transcript/| access-date =17 July 2021 }}</ref>

Keegan's dispute with the club was resolved in October 2009. The tribunal ruled in favour of Keegan, agreeing that Newcastle had [[constructive dismissal|constructively dismissed]] him by insisting on the signing of midfielder [[Nacho González (footballer, born 1982)|Nacho González]] on loan, against his wishes. The move was made to replace [[James Milner]] following his move to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], after a bid for [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]'s [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] was rejected.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/incredible-story-newcastle-trying-sign-12813690|title=The incredible story of Newcastle trying to sign Schweinsteiger on the cheap – and Keegan quitting|first=Mark|last=Douglas|work=Evening Chronicle|location=Newcastle-upon-Tyne|date=29 March 2017|access-date=7 July 2017}}</ref> Although Wise's signing of Spanish striker [[Xisco (footballer, born 1986)|Xisco]] was not mentioned in the hearing, Keegan stated that this had also been a central factor in his departure.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kevin-keegan-lifts-lid-what-15192026|title = Kevin Keegan lifts lid on what really happened with Xisco and Ignacio Gonzalez|first=Lee|last=Ryder|work=Evening Chronicle|location = Newcastle-upon-Tyne|date=24 September 2018|access-date=24 August 2020}}</ref>

The ruling was based around seven issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.com/2009-10html/2009-10-02kk-vs-nufc.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128060800/http://www.nufc.com/2009-10html/2009-10-02kk-vs-nufc.html| archive-date=28 November 2010| title=KK v NUFC – the verdict|publisher=Newcastle United F.C.|date=2 October 2009|access-date=10 August 2014}}</ref> The panel declared that Keegan had been led to believe he had the final decision on player transfers, and was never explicitly told in writing, his contract, nor by word of mouth that he did not, nor that his role would see him report to others. Given the generally understood role of a Premier League manager, the panel agreed he could reasonably expect that this was not a factor. The club's signing of González meant that they had violated his employment contract, which amounted to constructive dismissal. While González was the main issue in the decision, the club's alleged mistreatment of Keegan, claiming they were in a position to sack him should he not agree to the terms they offered, as well as his decision to remain at the club until 4 September instead of resigning on 1 September, allowing the club to reach a compromise, led to the ruling in Keegan's favour. Keegan was awarded £2 million (plus interest accrued) according to severance clauses in his contract. Claims for more were turned down on the basis that the standard contract severance clauses covered constructive dismissal. Keegan stated afterwards that the purpose of his claim had been to restore his reputation, and was delighted with the outcome, allowing him to move forward.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8286967.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Keegan wins £2m Newcastle damages | date=2 October 2009 | access-date=7 May 2010}}</ref>

In pursuit of winning the tribunal, the club admitted to misleading the media and their supporters. Several key senior staff, including [[Dennis Wise]] and [[Derek Llambias]], had publicly claimed that Keegan had "the final word"; they claimed to the tribunal that this was not in fact the case and that their claims were just "PR". It was then revealed that Wise asked Keegan to sign González after watching him "on [[YouTube]]". On 21 October, a subsequent meeting of the same panel found that the club should pay all legal and associated costs incurred by Keegan as a result of the tribunal. They reached this conclusion based on their view that the club's "defence on the primary liability issue was, in our view, wholly without merit".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_5642081,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Magpies must pay Keegan costs | date = 21 October 2009 | access-date =3 March 2012}}</ref>

In 1976, Keegan competed on [[BBC]]'s television programme ''[[Superstars (British TV programme)|Superstars]]''. Despite suffering severe cuts after crashing his bicycle, he insisted on re-racing and secured second place in the event, before going on to win that edition of the programme.<ref name=stars>{{cite news|url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tv_and_radio/superstars/3091096.stm |title = Superstars: A brief history|publisher=BBC Sport |date = 5 November 2004|access-date =5 February 2009}}</ref> He also advertised [[Brut (cologne)|Brut]] [[aftershave]] alongside boxer [[Henry Cooper (boxer)|Henry Cooper]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=McGurk |first=Helen |date=3 September 2021 |title=Blast from the past: Remember those TV ads for Old Spice and Brut? |url=https://www.newsletter.co.uk/heritage-and-retro/retro/blast-from-the-past-remember-those-tv-ads-for-old-spice-and-brut-3370963 |access-date=16 September 2024 |website=Belfast News Letter}}</ref>

In 1979, Keegan and his wife were featured on [[ITV1|ITV]]'s ''Brian Moore meets Kevin Keegan'', a documentary filmed over the course of the season. Cameras documented activities at the family's Hamburg home and Keegan's personal business appearances, offering a rare glimpse into the life of a modern millionaire footballer away from the pitch.<ref name="moore"/>

The same year, during his daughter's christening reception at a London hotel, [[Eamonn Andrews]], the presenter of ''[[This Is Your Life (British TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'', emerged from a giant cake to surprise Keegan and his guests with his famous big red book. The television show was broadcast on Keegan's 28th birthday, ten days later. Keegan quipped, "I'm so glad that I wore brown trousers."

He narrated the 90-minute documentary ''Keegan on Keegan'', released via Castle Vision on [[VHS]] cassette in 1992.

In August 2009, nearly a year after his departure from Newcastle, Keegan was confirmed as the lead pundit on [[TNT Sports 4|ESPN UK]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/24/espn-premiership-kevin-keegan | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=ESPN signs Kevin Keegan to front its Premier League coverage | first=Mark | last=Sweney | date=24 August 2009 | access-date=7 May 2010}}</ref> During the course of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], Keegan featured as a pundit for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. He was part of ESPN's live coverage of the [[2011 FA Cup final|2011]], [[2012 FA Cup final|2012]] and [[2013 FA Cup final|2013]] FA Cup finals, with pitchside build-up and post-match commentary.

===Music===
Keegan released a single in 1972 titled "It Ain't Easy". His song "[[Head Over Heels in Love (Kevin Keegan song)|Head Over Heels in Love]]", written by [[Chris Norman]] and Pete Spencer, was released on 9 June 1979. It peaked at number 31 in the UK charts, but climbed to number 10 in Germany where Keegan was based at the time, and where Norman's band [[Smokie (band)|Smokie]] was popular.<ref name=OverHeels>{{cite news|url=http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/bob.dunning/headover.htm |title=Kevin Keegan Head Over Heels in Love lyrics |publisher=Bob Dunning |access-date=21 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815040742/http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/bob.dunning/headover.htm |archive-date=15 August 2013 }}</ref> He released another single, "England", on his return to England from Germany, but it failed to chart.

==Personal life==
In September 1970, Keegan met his future wife, Jean Woodhouse, on the Waltzers at Doncaster fair.{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 394}} They married on 23 September 1974 and have two daughters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23494183-matches-of-the-day-how-footballing-marriages-of-yesterday-compare-to-coleen-and-waynes-lavish-nuptials.do |title=Matches of the Day: How footballing marriages of yesterday compare to Coleen and Wayne's lavish nuptials |date=12 June 2008 |access-date=3 March 2012 |work=Evening Standard |location=London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826223942/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23494183-matches-of-the-day-how-footballing-marriages-of-yesterday-compare-to-coleen-and-waynes-lavish-nuptials.do |archive-date=26 August 2011 }}</ref> Early on in his career at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], Keegan began using his middle name rather than his first name Joseph, changing his autograph to "Kevin Keegan" from the "JK Keegan" that he used at [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]].{{sfnp|Keegan|2018|loc=Kindle location 835}}

Keegan became renowned for his "[[permanent wave|poodle perm]]" hair in the 1970s, and has regularly appeared at the top of "worst hairstyles" surveys.<ref name=perm>{{cite news|url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/953251.stm|title = Keegan's the hair apparent|publisher=BBC Sport |date = 2 October 2000|access-date =5 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/dec/03/fashion.lifeandhealth |title = Footballers top poll for worst hairstyles|first = Hadley |last = Freeman|authorlink=Hadley Freeman|work=The Guardian |location=London |date = 3 December 2002|access-date =5 February 2009}}</ref>

In July 2008, [[Flybe (1979–2020)|Flybe International]] announced the naming of one of their new Bombardier Q400 aircraft in honour of Keegan's service to Newcastle United, both as a player and as manager. The plane was used on the regular service from [[Newcastle International Airport]] to London's [[Gatwick Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://news.travelcounsellors.co.uk/Flybe_passengers_set_to_fly_in_Kevin_Keegan_18676513.html|title = Flybe passengers set to fly in Kevin Keegan|publisher = Travel Counsellors|access-date = 10 August 2014|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080930085014/http://news.travelcounsellors.co.uk/Flybe_passengers_set_to_fly_in_Kevin_Keegan_18676513.html|archive-date = 30 September 2008}}</ref>

In April 1991, he was attacked while sleeping in his [[Range Rover]] by the [[M25 motorway|M25]] at [[Reigate]] Hill in Surrey. His assailants later said in court that they needed money for a drug debt and did not know they were attacking Keegan.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/27/newsstory.sport11|title=King Kev's circus act|first=Jamie|last=Jackson|work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=5 February 2009|date=27 May 2007 }}</ref>
