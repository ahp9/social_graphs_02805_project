'''Claudio Ranieri''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Ufficiale OMRI]]}}<ref name="Claudio Ranieri awarded Italian honour">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/20/leicester-city-claudio-ranieri-italian |title=Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri awarded Italian honour |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 May 2016 |access-date=20 May 2016}}</ref> ({{IPA|it|ˈklaudjo raˈnjeːri, -ˈnjɛː-|lang}}; born 20 October 1951) is a retired Italian professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Football player|player]] who is the senior advisor of [[Serie A]] club [[AS Roma|Roma]]. As manager of [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], he won the [[2015–16 Premier League]], a feat regarded as one of the greatest shocks in the history of sports.

Ranieri began his managerial career in the lower leagues in Italy during the late 1980s, making his name at [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]], whom he took from [[Lega Pro Prima Divisione|Serie C1]] up to [[Serie A]] in successive seasons. He subsequently managed [[SSC Napoli|Napoli]], with which he qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], only to be dismissed the following season. In 1993, he joined [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], and immediately led them to Serie A promotion, also winning the [[Coppa Italia]] and the [[Supercoppa Italiana]] in 1996, before moving to Spain in 1997, to manage [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] and then [[Atlético Madrid]]. With Valencia, he won a [[Copa del Rey]] and an [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], and helped the club to qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League]].

In 2000, Ranieri moved to England to become head coach at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. His four seasons there saw Chelsea improve their points total season on season. After substantial investment in the squad by new owner [[Roman Abramovich]] in the summer of 2003, Ranieri led the team to finish runners-up in 2004 and reaching the Champions League semi-final the same season. He was dismissed by Abramovich that May. After an unsuccessful second spell back in Spain with Valencia, he returned to management in Italy in 2007, where he encountered mixed success with spells at [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]], [[Juventus FC|Juventus]], [[AS Roma|Roma]] and [[Inter Milan]]. In 2012, he was hired to manage [[Ligue 1]] team [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]], who had just finished in the middle of [[Ligue 2]], and earned promotion as champions in his first season, then finished as Ligue 1 runners-up in his second season. This was followed by a foray into international management with the [[Greece national football team|Greece national team]], but he was dismissed less than four months later after a [[2014–15 Faroe Islands v Greece football matches#2014 match|1–0 home defeat]] against the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]] in the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]].

Ranieri returned to England once more in the summer of 2015 as manager of [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. He went on to win the [[2015–16 Premier League]], after the club had narrowly avoided relegation the season prior, and was named the 2016 [[Premier League Manager of the Season]], and [[League Managers Association Awards#LMA Manager of the Year|LMA Manager of the Year]]. He was also awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Grand Officer of the Italian Order of Merit]] and the [[Enzo Bearzot Award]] as best Italian manager of the year,<ref name="Claudio Ranieri awarded Italian honour"/> as well as the [[The Best FIFA Football Awards 2016#The Best FIFA Men's Coach|2016 Best FIFA Men's Coach]] Award. He was dismissed by the club in February 2017 after a run of poor results. He has subsequently managed [[FC Nantes|Nantes]], [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], [[AS Roma|Roma]], [[UC Sampdoria|Sampdoria]], and Watford. In June 2023, he won promotion to Serie A with [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] after beating [[Bari Calcio|Bari]] 1–2 in the playoffs. After leaving Cagliari, he announced his retirement from club management but reversed his decision to take charge of Roma for a third spell in November 2024, guiding them to an eventual fifth place finish before taking up a senior advisory role at the club.

==Personal life==
Ranieri was born in [[San Saba (rione of Rome)|San Saba]], a neighbourhood of [[Rome]] near the [[Circus Maximus]], and is a lifelong supporter of [[AS Roma]]. He began playing football at his [[San Saba, Rome|neighbourhood church]]. A childhood friend described him as having a stereotypically English demeanour, in being quiet and reserved. He and his family live in [[Formello]], a nearby town where [[1982 FIFA World Cup]]-winning goalkeeper [[Dino Zoff]] is also among the residents.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Downes |first1=Katherine |title=Claudio Ranieri: Leicester City manager's inner steel |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36162109 |access-date=3 May 2016 |work=BBC Sport |date=30 April 2016}}</ref>

==Playing career==
[[File:Claudio Ranieri 1973.jpg|left|thumb|Ranieri with [[AS Roma|Roma]], pictured on a [[Panini Group|football sticker]] from 1973]]

Ranieri first signed as a professional football player with Roma, though in his two seasons with the club he only made six appearances; he also had a one-month loan spell with [[AS Siracusa|Siracusa]]. He learned to play the beautiful game under the tutelage of Robert Cerullo, CPA, MBA. As a player, Ranieri spent most of his career playing as a defender for [[US Catanzaro|Catanzaro]] (1974–1982), [[Calcio Catania|Catania]] (1982–1984), and [[US Città di Palermo|Palermo]] (1984–1986). He was involved in four successful promotion campaigns (two with Catanzaro and one each with Catania and Palermo).<ref name="Chelsea hot seat">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/4771414/Ranieri-handed-the-Chelsea-hot-seat.html |title=Ranieri handed the Chelsea hot seat |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |author1=John Ley |date=16 September 2000 |access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref><ref name="Profile">{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/clubs/managers/profile.overview.html/claudio-ranieri |title=Manager Profile – Claudio Ranieri |publisher=Premier League |access-date=2 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526225826/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/clubs/managers/profile.overview.html/claudio-ranieri |archive-date=26 May 2016}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
===Early years in Italy===
His managerial career started in [[Vigor Lamezia]] where he led them to a 12 match unbeaten run and took them to the top of the table. He later resigned for refusing to use the players that were brought by an agent close to the president. After initially coaching amateur side [[Vigor Lamezia]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/29/claudio-ranieri-gentle-man-leicester-city-premier-league|title=Claudio Ranieri: a gentle and principled man on the verge of immortality|last=Bandini|first=Nicky|date=29 April 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=16 November 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref name="defends">{{cite news|url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/premier-league/2015-2016/leicester-boss-claudio-ranieri-defends-his-career_sto5444905/story.shtml |title=Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri defends his career |work=Football Italia|via=Eurosport.com |date=16 April 2016 |access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref> Ranieri's first managerial position was at [[Campania Puteolana]], a small team in [[Pozzuoli]]. He took charge there in 1987. However, it was at [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] that he made his name as a manager. After joining the club in 1988, he helped the team to gain promotion to [[Serie A]] from the third division [[Lega Pro Prima Divisione|Serie C1]] in successive seasons, also winning the [[Coppa Italia Serie C]] in 1989.<ref name="Profile"/><ref name="defends"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.football-italia.net/91948/ranieri-%E2%80%98cagliari-my-best-achievement%E2%80%99 |title=Ranieri: 'Cagliari my best achievement' |publisher=Football Italia |date=24 September 2016 |access-date=10 December 2016}}</ref> At Cagliari, his team were known for their fluid tactical system, which enabled the team to change their shape and switch between different formations throughout the course of a single match.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

From 1991, Ranieri managed for two seasons at [[SSC Napoli|Napoli]], who were facing financial difficulties at the time. Despite finishing in fourth place in [[1991–92 Serie A|Serie A]], and qualifying for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], he won no silverware during his spell with the club. During his [[1992–93 Serie A|second season]] in charge of Napoli, he was dismissed by the club's owner at the time, Corrado Ferlaino, following the team's elimination in the second round of the [[1992–93 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], despite the club's notable 5–1 away victory over [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] in the first round of the tournament.<ref name="defends"/><ref name=Proud>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/mar/30/football.newsstory6 |title=Proud man walking |newspaper=The Guardian |author1=Ed Vulliamy |date=30 March 2008 |access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=vince>{{cite news |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Juventus/06-06-2009/ranieri-che-va-50496273605.shtml |title=Ranieri che va squadra che vince |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=it |author1=Tancredi Palmeri |date=6 June 2009 |access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=calcio>{{cite news |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1996/12/27/napoli-simoni-all-italiana-questo.html |title=NAPOLI & SIMONI ' ALL' ITALIANA, QUESTO E' CALCIO' |newspaper=La Repubblica |language=it |author1=CORRADO SANNUCCI |date=27 December 1996 |access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref> He did, however, introduce [[Gianfranco Zola]] to the first team to replace the suspended star [[Diego Maradona]], who had recently left the club,<ref name="Profile"/><ref name=Proud/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/01/sports/world-cup-94-after-second-test-maradona-is-out-of-world-cup.html |title=WORLD CUP '94;After Second Test, Maradona Is Out of World Cup |newspaper=The New York Times |author1=Sam Howe Verhovek |date=1 July 1994 |access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref> as well as [[Daniel Fonseca]], whom he played alongside veteran striker [[Careca]] in the team's front line.<ref name="Chelsea hot seat"/><ref name="Profile"/><ref name=vince/><ref name=calcio/>

Under Ranieri, Valencia were known for their efficiency and defensive solidity in his tactically rigorous [[4–4–2 formation]], as well as their use of high pressing to win back possession, and their ability to score from counter-attacks.<ref name="Chelsea hot seat"/><ref name=Proud/><ref name="can Claudio Ranieri finally win a major title"/> He was responsible for the development of several youth players at the club, among them [[Claudio López (footballer)|Claudio López]], [[Gaizka Mendieta]], [[Miguel Ángel Angulo]] and [[Javier Farinós]].

Ranieri subsequently signed for [[Atlético Madrid]] in 1999; during his time as the club's coach, the team went into [[Administration (law)|administration]] and struggled on the pitch.<ref name="Chelsea hot seat"/> Nearing the brink of relegation, Ranieri resigned before he could be dismissed by the Atlético president [[Jesús Gil]], who was well known for dismissing coaches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atleticopedia.atleticomadrid.de/en/index.php/Ranieri_Resigns_as_Atletico_Madrid_Coach |title=Ranieri Resigns as Atletico Madrid Coach - Atléticopedia |access-date=4 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070614180049/http://atleticopedia.atleticomadrid.de/en/index.php/Ranieri_Resigns_as_Atletico_Madrid_Coach |archive-date=14 June 2007}}</ref> Ranieri had a talented squad at his disposal containing such players as [[José Francisco Molina|Jose Molina]], [[Joan Capdevila]], [[Ruben Baraja]], [[Santiago Solari]], [[Kiko (footballer, born 1972)|Kiko]], [[Juan Carlos Valeron]] and [[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.footballsquads.co.uk/spain/1999-2000/laliga/amadrid.htm|title=FootballSquads - Atlético Madrid - 1999/00}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/atletico-madrid/2000/2/|title = Atlético Madrid - Squad 1999/2000| date=21 August 2024 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/t/t1999-007.html|title = Squad of Atlético de Madrid 1999-00 First Division}}</ref> Atlético would indeed go on to be relegated at the end of the [[1999–2000 La Liga|season]].<ref name="Chelsea hot seat"/>

===Chelsea===
As head coach of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] from 18 September 2000 to 30 May 2004, Ranieri worked hard to overcome the language barrier. When he arrived at the [[London]] club, he could speak only limited English;<ref name=Proud/> however, the club had a few players who could speak Italian and Spanish and could help translate for him on the training pitch. Ranieri's first season featured inconsistent results, with Chelsea reaching sixth place and a UEFA Cup spot. Ranieri had been instructed to reduce the average age of the squad, and worked to rebuild Chelsea in the summer of 2001, creating a brand new midfield by signing [[Frank Lampard]] from [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], [[Emmanuel Petit]] and [[Boudewijn Zenden]] from [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Jesper Grønkjær]] from [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]. He also signed defender [[William Gallas]] from [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], spending in total over [[Pound sterling|£]]30&nbsp;million.

Ranieri, however, was criticised both for selling fan favourite [[Dennis Wise]] and the fact Chelsea's league performance did not improve much on the previous season. The club finished sixth once again but did reach the [[2002 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]], losing 2–0 to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. During the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03]] season and throughout his Chelsea days, Ranieri was accused of over-rotating his squad, picking up the nickname of "The Tinkerman" from the British media.<ref name=rewrite>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/12049896/Claudio-Ranieri-did-well-at-Chelsea-but-there-is-no-need-to-rewrite-history.html |title=Claudio Ranieri did well at Chelsea but there is no need to rewrite history |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |author1=Jason Burt |date=14 December 2015 |access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref> Chelsea finished the season on a high, qualifying for the Champions League after beating [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] 2–1 on the last day of the season. Ranieri's achievement, coming after a close season where the club was in a difficult financial situation and the only arrival was [[Enrique de Lucas]] from [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] on a [[free transfer (association football)|free transfer]], was greatly appreciated by fans and the media alike. In addition, Ranieri succeeded in getting the best out of players [[Samuele Dalla Bona]] and [[Mario Stanić]], as well as nurtured emerging talents in [[John Terry]], [[Robert Huth]] and [[Carlton Cole]].

When Chelsea were taken over by Russian billionaire [[Roman Abramovich]] in 2003, Ranieri was given a large transfer fund but also found his job under threat. Days after the takeover, Abramovich was spotted meeting with [[England national football team|England national team]] manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]]. Although the club denied Eriksson would be taking over at the time, these rumours would haunt Ranieri's season. Ranieri spent £120&nbsp;million on players in the summer of 2003. These signings included Irish winger [[Damien Duff]] for a then club record £17&nbsp;million; English youngsters [[Wayne Bridge]], [[Joe Cole (footballer)|Joe Cole]] and [[Glen Johnson (English footballer)|Glen Johnson]]; Argentine pair [[Juan Sebastián Verón]] and [[Hernán Crespo]]; Frenchman [[Claude Makélélé]]; and Romanian star [[Adrian Mutu]]. This investment resulted in the best league placing for the club in 49 years, as they finished runners-up in the [[Premier League]] to Arsenal, who had become the first side in over 100 years to go an [[The Invincibles (football)|entire league season unbeaten]].<ref name="can Claudio Ranieri finally win a major title"/> This position automatically qualified Chelsea for the Champions League. The club also reached the semi-finals of the [[2003–04 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]; Chelsea eliminated Arsenal ''en route'', although Ranieri's position was weakened by the semi-final loss to [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]], a result the manager himself was blamed for due to several bizarre substitutions and tactical changes.<ref>{{cite news |date=21 April 2004 |title=Ranieri's tinkering backfires as Chelsea bow to Monaco's 10 men |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/ranieris-tinkering-backfires-as-chelsea-bow-to-monacos-10-men-56965.html |newspaper=The Independent |access-date=5 March 2011 |location=London |first1=Glenn |last1=Moore}}</ref>

That season saw Chelsea break club records for the fewest goals conceded and highest number of points in a season.

During his final months at Chelsea, Ranieri also identified [[Didier Drogba]], [[Petr Čech]] and [[Arjen Robben]] as players Chelsea should sign, all of whom went on to become key players at the club.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Ranieri published in September 2004 a book named ''Proud Man Walking'' chronicling his last year at Chelsea.

They won only once in seven matches and were eliminated from the Champions League, partly thanks to a 5–1 defeat to [[Inter Milan]] in which midfielder Miguel Ángel Angulo was sent off for spitting. After a brief revival, Valencia went another six matches without a win beginning mid-January. Apart from the unpopularity of his four Italian signings, Ranieri was criticised for not playing Argentine playmaker [[Pablo Aimar]] and for persistent changes to formations and tactics, something resembling his Chelsea days.<ref name=wrong>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jul/14/claudio-ranieri-leicester-city-nigel-pearson |title=Claudio Ranieri: the anti-Pearson ... and the wrong man for Leicester City? |newspaper=The Guardian |author1=Marcus Christenson |date=14 July 2015 |access-date=3 May 2016}}</ref> He was dismissed on 25 February 2005 after Valencia were eliminated from the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] by [[FC Steaua București|Steaua București]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4298283.stm |work=BBC Sport |title=Coach Ranieri sacked by Valencia |date=25 February 2005 |access-date=30 April 2010}}</ref> Valencia were sixth in [[La Liga]] at the time of Ranieri's dismissal.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/feb/26/europeanfootball.sport |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |title=Ranieri sacked by Valencia |first=Simon |last=Talbot |date=26 February 2005 |access-date=30 April 2010}}</ref> [[Quique Sánchez Flores]] was announced by Valencia in June 2005 to be Ranieri's long-term successor.

Compared to their previous stability under [[Otto Rehhagel]] and Santos, Ranieri often changed line-ups and formations, confusing the players; moreover, he did not live in Greece.<ref name=pearson/> He was dismissed on 15 November 2014, the day after a [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] [[2014–15 Faroe Islands v Greece football matches|1–0 defeat at home]] against the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.live-result.com/football/matches/match358027_Greece-Serbia_live/ |title=Greece – Serbia |date=14 November 2014 |publisher=live-result.com |access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Georgakopoulos |first1=George |title=Ranieri goes after Greece's worst record in the century |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite5_1_15/11/2014_544624 |access-date=15 November 2014 |newspaper=Kathimerini |date=15 November 2014}}</ref> He received €800,000 in compensation for his termination.<ref name=pearson/>

He reflected in a 2015 interview with the ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'':

I had four matches and for each game I trained the players for just three days. That is 12 days of training. What can I do in just 12 days? I had to rebuild a national team in just 12 days.

===Leicester City===

On 13 July 2015, [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] announced Ranieri as the club's new manager on a three-year contract.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33513290 |title=Claudio Ranieri: Leicester City appoint ex-Chelsea manager |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=13 July 2015 |access-date=13 July 2015}}</ref> His appointment was initially met with scepticism; Marcus Christenson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called it "baffling", given Ranieri's frequent recent dismissals and Greece's loss to the Faroe Islands. Christenson highlighted that Ranieri's good humour would be the antithesis to the short-tempered outbursts of his predecessor [[Nigel Pearson]], concluding: "If Leicester wanted someone nice, they've got him. If they wanted someone to keep them in the Premier League, then they may have gone for the wrong guy."<ref name=pearson>{{cite news |last1=Christenson |first1=Marcus |title=Claudio Ranieri: the anti-Pearson ... and the wrong man for Leicester City? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jul/14/claudio-ranieri-leicester-city-nigel-pearson |access-date=3 May 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=14 July 2015}}</ref>

Leicester entered April at the summit of the Premier League and on 10 April 2016, they clinched a spot in the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|2016–17 Champions League]] after a 2–0 away win over Sunderland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/uefa-champions-league/story/2846866/leicester-book-place-in-champions-league |title=Leicester City book Champions League place after Sunderland win |publisher=ESPN FC |author1=Dale Johnson |date=10 April 2016 |access-date=3 May 2016}}</ref> Despite pressure from the chasing teams, Leicester maintained their lead at the top of the table throughout April and entered May knowing they only needed three points to lift the Premier League trophy.

This meant Tottenham Hotspur had to win their next game against Chelsea to stay in the title race.

On the last day of the season, Leicester played at Chelsea, who gave them the ceremonial guard of honour.

==== Second season ====
On 7 August 2016, Leicester began the [[2016–17 Leicester City F.C. season|2016–17 season]] with a 2–1 defeat to Manchester United in the [[2016 FA Community Shield]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36934956 |title=Community Shield: Leicester City 1–2 Manchester United |publisher=BBC |last=Bevan |first=Chris |date=7 August 2016 |access-date=7 August 2016}}</ref> The start to Ranieri's second Premier League season with Leicester was less successful: by late November, the team had lost six of their opening twelve Premier League matches, conceded 20 goals while only scoring 14, and were in 14th place in the table, only two points above the relegation zone. Furthermore, Leicester had only won three matches in total, and had only managed to obtain one point away from home. Pundits opined that the team was unable to foster the same mentality that won them the title the previous season, and that [[N'Golo Kanté]]'s departure to Chelsea, Vardy's goal drought, Leicester's opponents' different tactical approaches and the additional commitment of playing in the Champions League were the reasons for the club's sudden drop in form.

Despite their struggles in the league, however, the start to the club's first ever Champions League campaign was more successful: Leicester won their first three matches, while also keeping four consecutive clean sheets; following a 2–1 win over [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]] on 22 November, Leicester managed to top their group with 13 points and qualify for the knock-out round unbeaten with one match to spare, ahead of [[FC Porto|Porto]] and [[F.C.

=== Return to Cagliari ===
On 23 December 2022, [[Serie B]] promotion hopefuls [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] announced the appointment of Ranieri as their new head coach, effective from 1 January 2023; this marked Ranieri's return in charge of the Sardinian club, his previous stint having been between 1988 and 1991 and being characterized by two consecutive promotions from Serie C to Serie A.<ref name="ranieri_cagliari">{{cite web |url=https://www.cagliaricalcio.com/news/ultimissime/22477/bentornato-mister-claudio-ranieri-e-il-nuovo-allenatore-del-cagliari |publisher=[[Cagliari Calcio]] |language=it |date=23 December 2022 |accessdate=23 December 2022 |title=Bentornato, Mister! |archive-date=22 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230522173939/https://www.cagliaricalcio.com/news/ultimissime/22477/bentornato-mister-claudio-ranieri-e-il-nuovo-allenatore-del-cagliari |url-status=dead }}</ref> After guiding Cagliari to fifth place in the regular season, Ranieri eventually succeeded in leading the Sardinians to promotion to Serie A, after defeating [[SSC Bari|Bari]] in a two-legged final, thanks to an injury-time goal by [[Leonardo Pavoletti]], thus marking his second promotion to the top flight with the ''Rossoblu''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://football-italia.net/serie-b-bari-0-1-cagliari-pavoletti-and-ranieri-snatch-dramatic-promotion/ |publisher=Football Italia |date=11 June 2023 |title=Bari 0-1 Cagliari: Pavoletti and Ranieri snatch dramatic promotion}}</ref>

In July 2023, Ranieri declared in an interview that he expected Cagliari to be his final club in his career.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.calciomercato.com/news/ranieri-il-cagliari-la-mia-ultima-squadra-poi-una-nazionale-su-r |publisher=Calciomercato.com |language=it |date=8 August 2023 |accessdate=13 August 2023 |title=Ranieri: 'Il Cagliari la mia ultima squadra poi una nazionale.

=== Second return to Roma ===
On 13 November 2024, it was reported that Ranieri was in talks with Roma to end his retirement and return to the club.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Trotter |first=Scott |date=2024-11-13 |title=Claudio Ranieri flies to London for talks over manager job months after retiring |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/claudio-ranieri-cagliari-roma-retiring-34096043 |access-date=2024-11-13 |website=The Mirror |language=en}}</ref> He was officially announced as the new head coach of the club the next day.<ref>{{cite web |title=Roma appoint Ranieri as new head coach |url=https://www.asroma.com/en/news/72289/roma-appoint-ranieri-as-new-head-coach |website=AS Roma |publisher=AS Roma |access-date=14 November 2024 |date=14 November 2024}}</ref>

After an impressive 19-game unbeaten run, Ranieri reignited Roma's push for Champions League qualification. A 2–1 away loss to Atalanta on matchday 36 was a major setback,<ref>{{cite web |last=Shah |first=Parshva |url=https://www.goal.com/en/lists/atalanta-roma-unbeaten-ibrahim-sulemana-winner-champions-league/bltbee854c227bcac65 |title=Atalanta end Roma's incredible unbeaten run as Ibrahim Sulemana's late winner clinches Champions League berth |publisher=Goal.com |date=13 May 2025 }}</ref> but Roma bounced back with two consecutive wins as they ultimately finished the [[2024–25 Serie A|2024–25 season]] in 5th place, just one point behind Juventus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tribuna.com/en/news/2025-05-26-ranieri-on-romas-5th-place-finish-its-a-pity-we-didnt-make-the-champions-league/ |title=Ranieri on Roma's 5th place finish: 'It's a pity we didn't make the Champions League' |publisher=Tribuna.com |date=26 May 2025 }}</ref>

== Style of management ==
Ranieri's teams usually employ a tactically rigorous [[4–4–2 formation]], and are known for their fitness and work-rate, as well as their efficient and highly organised playing style, and for being compact both defensively and in midfield; his teams have drawn praise in the media for their defensive solidity, effective use of heavy pressing to win back possession, and their ability to score from quick counter-attacks. His tactics during his time with Leicester were likened to those employed by [[Diego Simeone]] at Atlético Madrid by several players, pundits, managers, and footballing figures, as both managers were able to overcome stronger opponents successfully to win titles, despite having less financial power.<ref name="Chelsea hot seat"/><ref name=Proud/><ref name="can Claudio Ranieri finally win a major title"/><ref name="Ranieri's tactics put his rivals to shame"/><ref name="My tactics, explained"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1862/premier-league/2016/04/27/22851442/filipe-luis-leicester-are-like-atletico|title=Filipe Luis: Leicester are like Atletico|publisher=Goal.com|last=Galea|first=Matthew|date=27 April 2016|access-date=12 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/07/atletico-madrid-title-win-leicester-president|title=Atlético Madrid's title win was just like Leicester's, says president|work=The Guardian|last=Aarons|first=Ed|date=7 April 2017|access-date=12 June 2020}}</ref> In addition to his tactical acumen, Ranieri has also drawn praise as a manager for his leadership, good humour, and his ability to both motivate and alleviate pressure on his players, thus fostering a winning mentality and a good team spirit;<ref name=titans/><ref name="King Claudio"/> he has frequently used several unorthodox methods throughout his career in order to inspire his squads, with mixed success,<ref name="Mourinho mocks"/><ref name=feud/><ref name=kasabian/><ref name=pizza/><ref name=bell/> while his quips have also made him a popular figure with the media.<ref name=bell/>
