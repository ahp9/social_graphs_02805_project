Born in [[Merseyside]], Gerrard played for his local club Liverpool for most of his professional career, from 1998 to 2015; here he won nine trophies, including one [[UEFA Champions League]] (2005), two [[FA Cup]]s and three [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]s. He was [[Player of the match#Association football|Man of the Match]] in the [[2005 UEFA Champions League final]], in which Liverpool overturned a 3–0 deficit to defeat [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|on penalties]], and the [[2006 FA Cup final]], which has been termed ''The Gerrard Final'' in homage to his performance. Despite success in cup competitions, he never won the [[Premier League]]. Gerrard won 114 England caps between 2000 and 2014, captaining the team 38 times and scoring 21 goals. He played at three [[UEFA European Championship]]s, in [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]], [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]] (where he was named in the [[UEFA Euro 2012#Awards|Team of the Tournament]]) and three [[FIFA World Cup]]s, in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]]. He spent two years at [[Major League Soccer]] club [[LA Galaxy]] and retired in 2016.

Gerrard began his managerial career managing the [[Liverpool F.C. Reserves and Academy|Liverpool Youth Academy]]'s under-18 team, before starting his senior managerial career in 2018 with [[Scottish Premiership]] club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. In his [[2020–21 Rangers F.C. season|third full season]] in charge, Gerrard's side went [[List of unbeaten football club seasons|unbeaten in the league]] to win Rangers' first league title in ten years. In November 2021, he was appointed manager of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], but he was dismissed after eleven months in charge. From July 2023 to January 2025, Gerrard managed [[Al-Ettifaq Club|Al-Ettifaq]] in Saudi Arabia. 

As a player, his individual awards include [[UEFA Club Footballer of the Year]] in 2005, [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] in 2006, [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] in 2009, appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 2007 and induction into the [[Premier League Hall of Fame]] in 2021. He was also named in the [[PFA Premier League Team of the Year]] a record eight times, more than any other footballer in [[Premier League]] history. As a manager, he was named as Manager of the Year for 2021 by [[PFA Scotland Manager of the Year|PFA Scotland]] and the [[SFWA Manager of the Year|SFWA]], due to his [[Scottish Premiership]] success with [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].

During this period, Gerrard credited assistant manager [[Pako Ayestarán]] as an essential figure in the team's success under Benítez. He described him as “the perfect number two”, highlighting his elite training standards, uplifting presence in the dressing room, and ability to communicate honestly with players. Gerrard said he always felt “fresh and fired-up” under Ayestarán’s guidance.

In 2015, a decade after the iconic 2005 champions league final in Istanbul, former Italy defender and AC Milan great, [[Paolo Maldini]], recalled memories of the final and heaped praise on Gerrard claiming that, "I think Steven has been, and is, an absolutely complete player, because he had personality, technique, he could set the play and also defend, and he could score goals – penalty-kicks, free-kicks. So really a modern, complete player," said the former Italy defender.

He also stated that, "I have a very clear memory of the final we lost in Istanbul, when he was helping his teammates with difficulties in defence. He started playing at the back and tackled every single player of Milan. It was a very special game during which we actually dominated Liverpool for 110 minutes out of 120. But I must say that what probably made the difference was his example for all his teammates, especially after reaching a draw, in being able to defend and resist, and at the end reach a result that was sincerely and absolutely unexpected after the first 45 minutes."<ref>{{cite web |last=Joyce |first=Paul |date=22 May 2015 |title=Paolo Maldini pays tribute to Steven Gerrard and remembers Liverpool's |url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/579310/Paolo-Maldini-Steven-Gerrard-Liverpool-Istanbul-miracle |access-date=16 November 2023 |website=Express.co.uk |archive-date=16 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231116170224/https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/579310/Paolo-Maldini-Steven-Gerrard-Liverpool-Istanbul-miracle |url-status=live }}</ref>
