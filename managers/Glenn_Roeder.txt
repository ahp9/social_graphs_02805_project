'''Glenn Victor Roeder''' (13 December 1955 – 28 February 2021) was an English professional [[association football|football]] player and manager.

As a player, Roeder played as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]. He also represented the [[England national football B team|England national B team]].

His managerial career included spells with numerous clubs including Gillingham, Watford, [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], Newcastle United (with whom he won the [[2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]) and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].  It was while he was at West Ham United that he was initially diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2003. He later acted as a managerial advisor for [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]].

==Playing career==
Roeder was born in [[Woodford, Essex]], on 13 December 1955 and played for Gidea Park Rangers and Essex and London schools, joining [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] as a schoolboy in December 1969 and then [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Orient]] in August 1972 after being released by Arsenal.<ref name="Kaufman02">{{cite book |last1=Kaufman |first1=Neilson N |last2=Ravenhill |first2=Alan E |title=The Men Who Made Leyton Orient Football Club |date=2002 |publisher=Tempus Publishing |isbn=0752424122 |pages=407–409}}</ref> He made his name as a classy ball-playing defender who was a member of the Orient playing squad in the Second Division during the 1970s that reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1978.<ref name="Kaufman02" /> He transferred to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] for £250,000 in August 1978 where he made 181 senior appearances and captained the team to the [[1982 FA Cup Final]] against Tottenham, missing the replay due to suspension, and to the Second Division title in 1983.<ref name="Kaufman02" /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mylondon.news/sport/football/fa-cup-final-good-twice-7141270 |title='FA Cup final?

Roeder was one of the first players famed for using the [[step over]] -the Roeder shuffle- a technique Roeder claimed, his father taught him as a child.{{sfnp|Simpson|2013|p=35}}

Roeder had a brief loan spell at [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]. Roeder transferred to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for £125,000 in December 1983, where he was captain and made 219 senior appearances during five years at the club, winning promotion from the Second Division in 1984.<ref name="Kaufman02" /> He joined [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on a free transfer in July 1989, making 78 senior appearances in two years, and later returned to the renamed Leyton Orient, playing eight games in 1992, before a six-game stint to finish his playing career at [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], whom he had joined as player-manager in November 1992.<ref name="Kaufman02" />

==Managerial and coaching career==

===Gillingham===
Roeder spent one season as player-manager of [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], during which time he led the side to 10 wins in 37 games and saw them finish second from bottom of the [[Football League]], escaping relegation after winning against bottom club [[Halifax Town F.C.|Halifax Town]] in the penultimate fixture of the season. He resigned in July 1993 to take over at Watford.<ref name="Metcalf93">{{cite web |last1=Metcalf |first1=Rupert |last2=Cole |first2=Robert |title=Football: Watford turn to Roeder to replace Perryman: Former player takes over at Vicarage Road to dismay of Gillingham |website=Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-watford-turn-to-roeder-to-replace-perryman-former-player-takes-over-at-vicarage-road-to-1484065.html |access-date=1 August 2020 |date=10 July 1993 |archive-date=1 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201131851/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-watford-turn-to-roeder-to-replace-perryman-former-player-takes-over-at-vicarage-road-to-1484065.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Watford===
After [[Steve Perryman]] left to join [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], Roeder was hired as the new manager of his former club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] at the start of the [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94]] season.<ref name="Metcalf93" /> However, Watford were fined £10,000 for an illegal approach, and ordered to pay Gillingham a further £30,000 in compensation.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Watford Football Club Illustrated Who's Who|author=Jones, Trefor|year=1996|isbn= 0-9527458-0-1|page=277}}</ref> In his second season with Watford he almost took the side to the play-offs, eventually finishing just two places outside them. However, he was sacked in February 1996 as the side were struggling at the bottom of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Taylor in frame as Roeder leaves Watford |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/taylor-in-frame-as-roeder-leaves-watford-1320193.html |website=Independent |access-date=1 August 2020 |date=21 February 1996 |archive-date=1 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801214408/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/taylor-in-frame-as-roeder-leaves-watford-1320193.html |url-status=live }}</ref> His replacement, [[Graham Taylor]], was unable to prevent the side from being relegated. During his time at Vicarage Road he signed [[Kevin Phillips (footballer)|Kevin Phillips]] from local [[Hertfordshire]] team, [[Baldock Town F.C.|Baldock Town]] for only £10,000.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.watfordfc.com/news/glenn-roeder-1955-2021 | publisher = [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] | access-date = 1 March 2021 | title = Glenn Roeder: 1955–2021 | date = 28 February 2021 | archive-date = 1 March 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210301104252/https://www.watfordfc.com/news/glenn-roeder-1955-2021 | url-status = live }}</ref>

===Burnley===
Roeder followed his tenure at Watford by taking a season away from the limelight, assuming a back seat role as [[Chris Waddle]]'s assistant manager at [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moore |first1=Glenn |title=Football: Waddle's plan to wake up 'sleeping giant' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-waddles-plan-to-wake-up-sleeping-giant-1245742.html |website=Independent |access-date=1 August 2020 |date=16 August 1997 |quote=[Waddle] also has an impressive back-room staff of Glenn Roeder, Gordon Cowans and Chris Woods...}}</ref> The partnership did not prove to be successful and the pair narrowly avoided steering Burnley into the bottom tier of English football.

===England===
Roeder then worked as a coach under [[Glenn Hoddle]] for the [[England national football team|England national team]], before West Ham manager [[Harry Redknapp]] offered him an opportunity in club football again in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|title=West Ham's biggest gamble |publisher=BBC |work=[[BBC Sport]] |access-date=18 November 2007 |date=14 June 2001 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1388269.stm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720234715/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1388269.stm |archive-date=20 July 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

===West Ham United===
West Ham manager Harry Redknapp initially appointed Roeder as a coach and scout at the club in 1999. However at the end of the 2000/2001 season Redknapp left the club following a dispute over transfer funds, and the Hammers' failed in their attempts to attract [[Steve McClaren]] and then [[Alan Curbishley]]. Unexpectedly Roeder was appointed manager.<ref>{{cite news|title=Roeder confirmed as West Ham boss |publisher=BBC |work=[[BBC Sport]] |access-date=18 November 2007 |date=14 June 2001 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1387656.stm |archive-date=22 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522034751/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1387656.stm |url-status=live  }}</ref> The appointment was opposed by some supporters, who had expected a bigger name to replace Redknapp.<ref>{{cite news|title=West Ham fans stage protest |publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport |access-date=18 November 2007 |date=14 June 2001 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1388647.stm |archive-date=23 April 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030423181733/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1388647.stm |url-status=live  }}</ref> Roeder received a £15 million transfer kitty, and guided West Ham to seventh in his first season in charge.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/feb/28/former-west-ham-manager-and-england-coach-glenn-roeder-dies-aged-65|title=Former West Ham manager and England coach Glenn Roeder dies aged 65|date=28 February 2021|website=The Guardian|access-date=1 March 2021|archive-date=28 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210228201804/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/feb/28/former-west-ham-manager-and-england-coach-glenn-roeder-dies-aged-65|url-status=live}}</ref> He signed David James from Aston Villa,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/aug/17/newsstory.sport3|title=David James may be out for six months|first=Jon|last=Brodkin|newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 August 2001|via=www.theguardian.com|access-date=1 March 2021|archive-date=5 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305121903/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/aug/17/newsstory.sport3|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Tomáš Řepka]] from [[ACF Fiorentina]] for £5.5 million,<ref name=repka>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/brooking-steps-in-again-after-west-ham-sack-roeder-101698.html|title=Brooking steps in again after West Ham sack Roeder|date=12 September 2013|website=The Independent|access-date=1 March 2021|archive-date=1 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210301104252/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/brooking-steps-in-again-after-west-ham-sack-roeder-101698.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Don Hutchison]] from [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] for £5 million, a club record fee at the time, and made permanent the transfer of Sebastien Schemmel who had impressed on loan the prior season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1514594.stm|title=Roeder signs Hutchison|date=30 August 2001|via=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=1 March 2021|archive-date=6 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306125132/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1514594.stm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="WHUFC1">{{cite web | title=Sébastien Schemmel returns to West Ham United | website=West Ham United F.C. | date=2024-05-30 | url=https://www.whufc.com/news/sebastien-schemmel-returns-west-ham-united | access-date=2024-05-30 | archive-date=30 May 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240530153603/https://www.whufc.com/news/sebastien-schemmel-returns-west-ham-united | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="WHUFC2">{{cite web | title=The flying French full-back who became an unlikely Hammer of the Year | website=West Ham United F.C. | date=2024-05-30 | url=https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2020/june/02-june/sebastien-schemmel-flying-french-full-back-who-became-unlikely | access-date=2024-05-30 | archive-date=30 May 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240530153605/https://www.whufc.com/news/articles/2020/june/02-june/sebastien-schemmel-flying-french-full-back-who-became-unlikely | url-status=live }}</ref> The club started the season poorly, James was injured on international duty before he could make an appearance for the club, and several other regulars continued to miss large portions of the season while Repka was sent off twice in the first 5 games of the season. However the club recovered to finish in 7th position in Roeders first season in charge, with young player Jermain Defoe making an immediate impact up front with [[Frederic Kanoute]] and Schemmel going on to win the Hammer of the Year award.

The [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03]] season started off similarly poorly as West Ham struggled with injuries to their forwards and midfielders leaving them with Defoe as their main, and often the only fully fit, forward. West Ham had spent no money over the summer, their only significant permanent signing being free agent [[Gary Breen]] who had impressed at the [[2002 World Cup]] for Ireland. West Ham were bottom at Christmas with only 3 wins and a half dozen draws to their name. At that time no team had ever avoided relegation from that position. The board made limited funds available after Christmas, and the January signings of [[Rufus Brevett]], [[Les Ferdinand]] and loan of [[Lee Bowyer]] on a short-term deal helped to improve the club's form, winning 4 and drawing 3 of their next 10 games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/on-this-day/feature/otd-ferdinand-joins-west-ham_200303.html?t=123987456&s=zero|title=On this day: Les Ferdinand joins West Ham United - Sports Mole|website=amp.sportsmole.co.uk|access-date=1 March 2021|archive-date=14 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220414014457/https://amp.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/on-this-day/feature/otd-ferdinand-joins-west-ham_200303.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=repka/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/brevett-moves-across-london-to-west-ham-1.459360|title=Brevett moves across London to West Ham|newspaper=The Irish Times}}</ref> Roeder had a dispute with striker [[Paolo Di Canio]] after he substituted Di Canio in a match against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] due to injury.

In October 2007, Roeder joined [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], signing a contract until 2010, with Norwich bottom of the division and four points adrift of safety.<ref>{{cite news|title=Norwich name Roeder as new boss |publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport |access-date=18 November 2007 |date=30 October 2007 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/7068855.stm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101072434/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/7068855.stm |archive-date=1 November 2007 |url-status=live  }}</ref> His first game in charge was on 4 November in the [[East Anglian derby]] against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], a match that ended 2–2. His first win came in the home game against Coventry City (24 November), which he followed up with a first away win of the season for Norwich in the 3–1 defeat of Blackpool (27 November), who previously had not lost at home that season. He then guided the team out of the relegation zone with a series of wins.  Roeder began an overhaul of the squad in the January transfer window, releasing players such as [[Julien Brellier]] and [[David Střihavka]]. He made the loan signing of [[Matty Pattison]] permanent and also renewed the loan deals for [[Ched Evans]] and [[Mo Camara]].  Roeder also made four further loan signings including Matthew Bates, Keiran Gibbs, Alex Pearce and James Henry. Despite a poor run of form through February and March, Roeder kept Norwich in the Championship for another season, though survival was not confirmed until a 3–0 home win against QPR in the penultimate fixture of the season.<ref name=pink/>

On 25 July 2008, Roeder was fined £1,000 and given a suspended two-match touchline ban at a FA disciplinary hearing after criticising referee [[Andy D'Urso]] following a 2–1 defeat to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] at [[Ashton Gate Stadium]] on 29 March.<ref>{{cite news

In May 2008 a few days after the last game of the season Roeder decided not to renew [[Darren Huckerby]]'s contract which angered many supporters as they were unable to give him a proper sendoff. Roeder brought in a number of loan players in the summer.  Norwich made a difficult start to the 2008–09 season although there were some good results including a 5–2 win against top of the table Wolves in October. After that result, however, Norwich entered a poor run of form. A 2–0 win against local rivals Ipswich in the East Anglian Derby at the start of December helped to briefly relieve the pressure on Roeder, however after this Norwich won one further league game under his management against bottom of the league Charlton at Carrow Road in December.<ref name=pink/> January began with a draw away at Charlton in the FA cup and a loss to Sheffield United. When the team lost the FA Cup third round replay 1–0 at Carrow Road against Charlton, who had not won in 18 games, Roeder was sacked the following day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canaries.co.uk/page/NewsDetails/0,,10355~1519768,00.html |title=OFFICIAL CLUB STATEMENT &#124; Norwich City &#124; News &#124; First News &#124; First News &#124; OFFICIAL CLUB STATEMENT |access-date=16 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116114048/http://www.canaries.co.uk/page/NewsDetails/0%2C%2C10355~1519768%2C00.html |archive-date=16 January 2009  }}</ref>
