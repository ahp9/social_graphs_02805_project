Koeman scored over 250 goals whilst playing in defence for the majority of his career. Koeman was capable of playing both as a [[defender (association football)|defender]] and as a [[midfielder]]; he frequently played as a [[sweeper (association football)|sweeper]], although he was equally known for his [[List of world association football records|goalscoring]], long-range shooting, and accuracy from free kicks and penalties. Because of his goalscoring, he is considered one of the best attacking center backs of all time.<ref>{{Cite web |date=18 January 2017 |title=Ask ESPN FC - Goalscoring Defenders - ESPN FC |url=http://www.espnfc.us/story/1563004/ask-espn-fc-goalscoring-defenders |access-date=15 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118032637/http://www.espnfc.us/story/1563004/ask-espn-fc-goalscoring-defenders |archive-date=18 January 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Stevenson |first=William

Born in [[Zaandam]], Koeman began his career at [[FC Groningen|Groningen]] before transferring to the Netherlands' most successful club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in 1983, where they won the national [[List of Dutch football champions|Eredivisie title]] in [[1984–85 Eredivisie|1984–85]]. He then joined Ajax's [[AFC Ajax–PSV Eindhoven rivalry|rivals]] [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] in 1986, winning three consecutive Eredivisie titles ([[1986–87 Eredivisie|1986–87]], [[1987–88 Eredivisie|1987–88]] and [[1988–89 Eredivisie|1988–89]]) and the [[European Cup]] in [[1987–88 European Cup|1988]]. Ronald Koeman is one of five European players to ever win a [[Treble (association football)|treble]] with their club and a cup with their national team in the same year. The other four players are his teammates [[Hans van Breukelen]], [[Berry van Aerle]], [[Gerald Vanenburg]] and [[Wim Kieft]]. In 1989, Koeman moved to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and became part of [[Johan Cruyff]]'s "Dream Team", helping the club win [[La Liga]] four consecutive seasons (1991 to 1994), and the [[1991–92 European Cup]], where he scored the winning goal of [[1992 European Cup Final|the final]] against [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]].

At international level, Koeman was one of the stars of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]], alongside [[Marco van Basten]], [[Ruud Gullit]], [[Frank Rijkaard]] and [[Dennis Bergkamp]]. During his career with the Netherlands, Koeman won [[UEFA Euro 1988]] and played at [[UEFA Euro 1992]], as well as the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s, [[Captain (association football)|captaining]] the team at the latter.

In his managerial career, Koeman has won three Eredivisie titles: twice with Ajax ([[2001–02 Eredivisie|2001–02]] and [[2003–04 Eredivisie|2003–04]]) and once with PSV ([[2006–07 Eredivisie|2006–07]]). He is the only individual to have both played for and managed the "[[Big Three (Netherlands)|Big Three]]" of Dutch football: Ajax, PSV and [[Feyenoord]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.com.au/manager/255/ronald-koeman|title=Ronald Koeman|access-date=23 January 2016|work=ESPN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129001920/http://www.espnfc.com.au/manager/255/ronald-koeman|archive-date=29 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Abroad, he had spells in Portugal with [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and Spain with [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], coaching ''Los Ché'' to victory in the [[2007–08 Copa del Rey]], and managed [[Premier League]] clubs [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the 2010s. He was the manager of the Netherlands national team between 2018 and 2020, finishing runners-up in the 2019 [[UEFA Nations League]]. In August 2020, he was appointed manager of Barcelona, with whom he won the [[2020–21 Copa del Rey]], but was sacked in October 2021, following a poor start to the [[2021–22 FC Barcelona season|new season]]. In 2023, he was reappointed as the manager of the Netherlands national team.

==Club career==
===Netherlands===
Koeman started his professional career at [[FC Groningen|Groningen]], making his debut at the age of 17 years and 183 days in a 2–0 win over [[N.E.C. (football club)|NEC]] in the [[Eredivisie]]. This made him the third-youngest player in the club's history, after [[Piet Wildschut]] and Bert de Voogt.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fcgroningen.nl/home/nieuws/nieuwsbericht/artikel/zivkovic-jongste-debutant-in-clubgeschiedenis/?no_cache=1/|title=Zivkovic jongste debutant in clubgeschiedenis|date=3 December 2012|work=FC Groningen|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129003559/http://www.fcgroningen.nl/home/nieuws/nieuwsbericht/artikel/zivkovic-jongste-debutant-in-clubgeschiedenis/?no_cache=1%2F|archive-date=29 January 2016}}</ref> Thirty-three goals from ninety appearances in his three seasons at the club saw the young defender called up by the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]] and earn a transfer to [[List of Dutch football champions|Eredivisie champions]] [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]. After failing to defend their title in Koeman's first season at the club, the [[Amsterdam]] team regained the championship in [[1984–85 Eredivisie|1984–85]]. The following season saw [[Johan Cruyff]] take over as Ajax head coach and, despite scoring 120 goals in 34 Eredivisie matches and winning the [[1985–86 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]], ''de Godenzonen'' could only finish second in the league behind [[AFC Ajax–PSV Eindhoven rivalry|rivals]] [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]].

In the summer of 1986, Koeman controversially transferred to PSV to play for [[Hans Kraay Sr.|Hans Kraay]]'s champions. Towards the end of the [[1986–87 Eredivisie|1986–87 season]], Kraay resigned and was replaced by [[Guus Hiddink]], under the management of whom PSV overtook league leaders Ajax in the final weeks of the season to defend their league title. Koeman enjoyed further success with Hiddink and PSV in the following seasons, as the team also won the [[1987–88 Eredivisie|1987–88]] and [[1988–89 Eredivisie]] titles and the club's first, and to date only, [[1988 European Cup Final|European Cup]] against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in [[Stuttgart]] on 25 May 1988. PSV had also won the KNVB Cup in both [[1987–88 KNVB Cup|1988]] and [[1988–89 KNVB Cup|1989]], making their successes in the two years [[Treble (association football)|trebles]] and [[Double (association football)|doubles]] respectively. In his three seasons at PSV, Koeman scored 51 goals in 98 league appearances, averaging more than one goal every two matches. During 1987–88 season, he recorded the highest scoring season of his club career, with 21 goals scored in the league.<ref>{{cite news |date=28 July 2011 |title=Een zeldzaam stukje clubliefde van 'clubhoer' Koeman |url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/5619/Feyenoord/article/detail/2821544/2011/07/28/Een-zeldzaam-stukje-clubliefde-van-clubhoer-Koeman.dhtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202032121/http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/5619/Feyenoord/article/detail/2821544/2011/07/28/Een-zeldzaam-stukje-clubliefde-van-clubhoer-Koeman.dhtml |archive-date=2 February 2016 |access-date=23 January 2016 |work=Algemeen Dagblad}}</ref>

===Barcelona===
In 1989, Koeman re-joined his former Ajax coach Johan Cruyff at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], where he became a member of the famous "[[FC Barcelona#Dream Team|Dream Team]]". During his first season at the club, Barcelona won the [[1989–90 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]], beating [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] 2–0 in [[1990 Copa del Rey Final|the final]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.football-oranje.com/hall-of-fame-ronald-koeman/|title=Hall of Fame: Ronald Koeman|date=17 September 2013|work=Football Oranje|access-date=23 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128042257/http://www.football-oranje.com/hall-of-fame-ronald-koeman/|archive-date=28 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Along with players such as [[Hristo Stoichkov]], [[Romário]], [[Pep Guardiola]] and [[Michael Laudrup]], Koeman helped the club win [[List of Spanish football champions|La Liga]] four consecutive seasons years (1991 to 1994). He scored the only goal of the [[1992 European Cup Final]] with a free-kick from the edge of the [[penalty area|18-yard box]] against [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] to make Barça European champions for the first time in their history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/bosh-10-best-goals-defenders|title=Bosh!

Koeman was known for his powerful right-footed free kicks and deadball ability where he scored many vital goals for the team.<ref>{{Cite news |date=27 March 2006 |title=Benfica-coach Koeman hoopt op stunt tegen Barcelona |url=http://www.nu.nl/sport/701183/benfica-coach-koeman-hoopt-op-stunt-tegen-barcelona.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629192302/http://www.nu.nl/sport/701183/benfica-coach-koeman-hoopt-op-stunt-tegen-barcelona.html |archive-date=29 June 2011 |access-date=16 August 2010 |work=[[NU.nl]] |language=nl}}</ref> One of his best strikes in La Liga came in the memorable 5–0 win over Real Madrid in 1994, with his [[curl (football)|bending]] free kick making the scoreline 2–0.<ref>{{Cite web |date=10 January 2012 |title=Strikers' trademark goals: the Thierry Henry control-and-place, the Romario toe-poke and more |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9004492/Strikers-trademark-goals-the-Thierry-Henry-control-and-place-the-Romario-toe-poke-and-more.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007040341/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/9004492/Strikers-trademark-goals-the-Thierry-Henry-control-and-place-the-Romario-toe-poke-and-more.html |archive-date=7 October 2018 |access-date=5 December 2013 |website=The Telegraph}}</ref> Koeman was joint-top scorer with eight goals in the [[1993–94 UEFA Champions League]], in which Barcelona were beaten 0–4 in the [[1994 UEFA Champions League Final|final]] by [[A.C.

===Return to the Netherlands and retirement===
After six years and over 200 appearances at Barcelona, Koeman left Spain to return to the Netherlands in 1995. In joining [[Feyenoord]], he became one of the few players to represent all of Dutch football's "[[Big Three (Netherlands)|Big Three]]". Koeman spent two seasons in Rotterdam, captaining Feyenoord to third- and second-place finishes in the Eredivisie respectively.

Koeman ended his career with 192 league goals from 533 matches (ahead of [[Daniel Passarella]], who netted 182 goals in 556 matches) during his career, more than any other defender in the history of football.<ref name="iffhd"/>

==Managerial career==
===Early years===
Having retired as a player after his stint with Feyenoord, Koeman became a member of the Netherlands international coaching staff of [[Guus Hiddink]] during the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] along with [[Johan Neeskens]] and Frank Rijkaard. After the tournament, he was appointed the assistant coach of Barcelona, and in 2000, he was handed his first managerial job as the head coach of [[SBV Vitesse|Vitesse]], where he led the team to a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] spot in his only season.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ronald Koeman: Chelsea influence makes Vitesse difficult to manage |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/9929056/ronald-koeman-chelsea-influence-makes-vitesse-difficult-to-manage |access-date=4 November 2021 |publisher=Sky Sports |date=30 July 2015}}</ref>

===Ajax===
Koeman was appointed the manager of Ajax in 2001. He won a domestic double in [[2001–02 Eredivisie|2001–02]]. Despite regaining the title in [[2003–04 Eredivisie|2003–04]], Ajax had fallen eight points behind rivals PSV in the Eredivisie. This situation, coupled with Ajax being knocked out of the [[2004–05 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] by [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]], 3–2 on aggregate, led Koeman to resign the following day on 25 February 2005.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/feb/25/newsstory.ajax|title = Koeman quits Ajax|work = [[The Guardian]]|date = 25 February 2005|access-date = 22 December 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140917185742/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/feb/25/newsstory.ajax|archive-date = 17 September 2014|url-status = live}}</ref> During Koeman's spell at Ajax, a young [[Zlatan Ibrahimovic]] started his rise to international fame, and [[Wesley Sneijder]] and [[Rafael van der Vaart]] made their debut.

===Benfica===
In June 2005, Koeman took up the vacant position at Portuguese champions Benfica, following the departure of [[Giovanni Trapattoni]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Benfica name Koeman |url=https://www.eurosport.com/football/european-leagues/2004-2005/benfica-name-koeman_sto728170/story.shtml |access-date=4 November 2021 |publisher=Eurosport |date=6 June 2005}}</ref> On 13 August, he won the [[2005 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira|2005]] [[Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira]] against [[Vitória F.C.|Vitória de Setúbal]] with a single goal by [[Nuno Gomes]].<ref>{{cite news |title=BENFICA - V.

This, along with an offer from PSV, sufficed for the manager to leave one year before the end of his contract. Under Koeman, Benfica did reach the quarter-finals of the [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League]]; eliminating [[Manchester United]] in the final game of the group stage and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the first knockout stage,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4494936.stm|title=Benfica 2-1 Man Utd|publisher=BBC|date=7 December 2005|access-date=5 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624205534/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4494936.stm|archive-date=24 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news

===PSV===
In the [[2006–07 Eredivisie|2006–07]] season, Koeman served as head coach of PSV, as successor to Guus Hiddink. PSV dominated the first season half, keeping competitors [[AZ Alkmaar|AZ]] and Ajax at a reasonable distance, and PSV seemed almost destined to become champions again. PSV, however, suffered in the second half of the season, also because of injuries of players [[Jefferson Farfán]], [[Alex (footballer, born June 1982)|Alex]] and [[Ibrahim Afellay]], obtaining only 19 out 39 possible points.<ref>[http://www.volkskrant.nl/sport/article418345.ece/PSV_roept_rampspoed_over_zich_af "PSV roept rampspoed over zich af"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428061224/http://www.volkskrant.nl/sport/article418345.ece/PSV_roept_rampspoed_over_zich_af |date=28 April 2007 }}.

Alkmaar played struggling [[Excelsior Rotterdam|Excelsior]] in their final match, but did not manage to win. Ajax played at [[Willem II (football club)|Willem II]], but did not score enough goals; it was PSV eventually who triumphed, winning at home 5–1 against Vitesse, and thereby becoming Eredivisie champions, one goal ahead of Ajax.

For the second consecutive season, he guided a team to the quarter-finals of the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], this time defeating another English club in the shape of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the first knockout stage by an aggregate score of 2–1,<ref>{{cite news

As with his penalties, when he would charge towards the ball like a man with murder in mind only to tap it gently into the net, part of the skill was in the deception. With Koeman, there was more than one way to skin a defensive wall; as all Englishmen know well, he could flippin' flip one as well."<ref name="free-kick specialists"/>

==Style of management==
Koeman most commonly organises his teams to have a defensive approach led by their method of attack, whether that be a 4–3–3, a 4–2–3–1 or an alternative, and to defend with minimal space between the lines. Describing his coaching style when appointed as manager of Barcelona, he said: "I’m a coach who likes his teams to be disciplined and well-organised team. I like to dominate games. The Dutch like attacking football. I like to be direct and have good communication with my players. We hold short meetings but that make the message clear."<ref name=coach>{{cite news|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/news/1763250/koeman-seeking-style-success-and-smiles |title=Koeman seeking style, success and smiles }}</ref>
