==Club career==
===West Ham United===
Trevor David Brooking was born on 2 October 1948 in [[Barking, London|Barking]], Essex,<ref>{{Hugman|2334|access-date=21 September 2024}}</ref> to mother Margaret and father Henry Charles (known as Harry), who was a police officer in the [[Metropolitan Police]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brooking|Hart|2014|p=12}}</ref> Brooking attended Ripple Infants School and left [[Ilford County High School]] with 11 [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-level]]s and 2 [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A-levels]].<ref name="brooking">{{cite book |last=Brooking |first=Trevor |title=Trevor Brooking |publisher=Pelham Books |year=1981 |isbn=0-7207-1374-9}}</ref> His father took him to see his first [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] game at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]], a 1–1 draw against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 19 April 1958, when he was nine years old.<ref name=brooking/><ref>{{cite web |title=Game played on 19 Apr 1958 |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&ham=2094&united=19_Apr_1958 |publisher=westhamstats.info |access-date=17 September 2012}}</ref> Aged fifteen he trained at both [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref name="page 17">{{harvnb|Brooking|Hart|2014|p=17}}</ref> However, West Ham manager [[Ron Greenwood]] watched him with scout [[Wally St Pier]], and Brooking was offered apprenticeships by all three clubs, with only West Ham allowing him to stay on at school to finish his studies.<ref name="page 17"/> Despite his parents being offered £500 and a car by manager [[Tommy Docherty]] to gain his signature for Chelsea he remained at school signing an apprenticeship deal with West Ham on 24 July 1965, his parents receiving no fee.<ref name=brooking/>

In June 1967, Brooking made his senior debut in a friendly for West Ham against [[Grasshopper Club Zürich|Grasshopper Zürich]] in Switzerland.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Man on the back page |journal=Hammer: West Ham United F.C. Official Programme|page=1|date=2 January 1982}}</ref> His league debut came in place of wide-right [[Brian Dear]] on 29 August 1967 in a 3–3 draw with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] at [[Turf Moor]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brooking|Hart|2014|p=31}}</ref> His first goal came on 26 December 1967 in a 4–2 away win at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].<ref name=whustats>{{cite web |title=Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Trevor Brooking |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&ham=85&united=Trevor_Brooking |publisher=westhamstats.info |access-date=17 September 2012}}</ref> His first season saw him play 28 games, scoring nine goals. His second season saw 37 appearances and eight goals. His only [[hat-trick]] came on 6 April 1968 in a 5–0 home defeat of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]].<ref name=whustats/> 

In December 1969, during his third season, Brooking chipped a bone in his ankle in a game against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].<ref name="page 39">{{harvnb|Brooking|Hart|2014|p=39}}</ref> The club signed [[Peter Eustace]] for £90,000 to take his place; his recovery took longer than expected, and he considered giving up the game.<ref name="page 39"/> However, he returned to playing and with the departure of [[Martin Peters]] to Tottenham in March 1970, Brooking became a regular in midfield. His place in the side came under threat in the 1971–72 season with the purchase of midfielder [[Tommy Taylor (footballer born 1951)|Tommy Taylor]], and Brooking was transfer-listed at his request.<ref>{{harvnb|Brooking|Hart|2014|p=45}}</ref> However, the failure of the defensive partnership between [[Bobby Moore]] and [[Alan Stephenson]] saw Stephenson dropped and Taylor being moved into defence; Brooking remained an ever-present for the rest of the season and was voted [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|Hammer of the Year]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brooking|Hart|2014|p=46}}</ref> 

During the 1972–73 season he came to the attention of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] manager [[Brian Clough]], who offered West Ham £400,000 for Brooking and Moore. However, Greenwood refused to let the pair leave.<ref>{{harvnb|Brooking|Hart|2014|p=47}}</ref> Again, in 1974 Tottenham manager [[Bill Nicholson (footballer)|Bill Nicholson]] offered £425,000 for the signature of Brooking. According to Brooking in his autobiography, this move was not pursued as he felt Nicholson, a manager he admired, was coming to the end of his Tottenham career and was unsure which manager would follow him.<ref name=brooking/>

He won the [[FA Cup]] twice, in [[1975 FA Cup Final|1975]]<ref name=1975fa>{{cite web |title=1975 West Ham v Fulham |url=http://www.thefa.com/Competitions/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/historyofthefacup/1975westhamfulham |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120428152821/http://www.thefa.com/Competitions/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/HistoryOfTheFACup/1975WestHamFulham |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 April 2012 |publisher=thefa.com |access-date=17 September 2012 }}</ref> with Brooking scoring a vital goal in a 2–1 win in a fourth round replay away at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]]<ref name=stfc>{{cite web |title=Game played on 28 Jan 1975 |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&ham=2911&united=28_Jan_1975 |publisher=westhamstats.info |access-date=17 September 2012}}</ref> and [[1980 FA Cup Final|1980]]; in the latter, he scored another vital goal in a 2–1 win in a third round replay against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]<ref name=wbfc>{{cite web |title=Game played on 08 Jan 1980 |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&ham=3158&united=08_Jan_1980 |publisher=westhamstats.info |access-date=17 September 2012}}</ref> and the only goal in a 1–0 win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the final with a header.<ref>{{cite web|title=FA Cup Final hero: Sir Trevor Brooking |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20060513/fa-cup-final-hero-sir-trevor-brooking_2236884_1141136 |publisher=whufc.com |access-date=23 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217203349/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20060513/fa-cup-final-hero-sir-trevor-brooking_2236884_1141136 |archive-date=17 February 2015 }}</ref> Brooking scored what was considered goal of the year in the Golden Goals Competition on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], according to the panel ([[Dave Sexton]], [[Pat Jennings]], Vic Railton and [[Bernard Joy]]) for the [[1976 British League season]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Golden Goals 1976 | date=15 June 2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk82PGXxmEY |access-date=5 April 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

His last game for West Ham came on 18 May 1984 in 1–0 home defeat by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].<ref name=whustats/> In total he made 647 appearances and scoring 102 times, wearing the number 10 jersey, his total appearances for West Ham beaten only by [[Billy Bonds]], [[Bobby Moore]] and [[Frank Lampard, Sr.|Frank Lampard]] Sr. He had a [[testimonial match]] against an England XI in October 1977.<ref>{{harvnb|Brooking|Hart|2014|p=53}}</ref>

==International career==
Brooking made his [[England national football team|England]] debut on 3 April 1974 in a 0–0 draw against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]].<ref name=England>{{cite web |title=Trevor Brooking&nbsp;— England |url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/trevor-brooking-10956/english-caps-part-1-1974-78_a11103/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130222125910/http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/trevor-brooking-10956/english-caps-part-1-1974-78_a11103/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 February 2013 |publisher=sporting-heroes.net |access-date=23 June 2012}}</ref> He played 47 times, scoring five goals but only appeared twice in major tournaments.

Playing for only the last half-hour of the game, Brooking forced one excellent save from the Spanish goalkeeper, [[Luis Arconada]], but with England needing to win to qualify for the semi-final a 0–0 draw saw them eliminated. This was to be his final international appearance.<ref name=Lastintgame>{{cite web |title=Trevor Brooking |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Players/B/Trevor-Brooking |publisher=thefa.com |access-date=18 May 2013 |archive-date=16 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516174007/http://thefa.com/England/All-Teams/Players/B/Trevor-Brooking |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Style of play==
Brooking was primarily right-footed, but was comfortable on his left foot, due to repeated practice. He played as an attacking midfield player, known for his controlled passing and midfield authority.<ref>{{cite web |title=Diamonds Aren't Forever |url=http://www.thesportcollective.com/diamonds-arent-forever-joe-cole-england-liverpool-chelsea-west-ham/2011/06/ |publisher=thesportcollective.com |access-date=24 September 2012}}</ref> Early in his career he was vulnerable to being out-muscled by opposition players (leading his teammates to nickname him 'Cyril' after [[Cyril Lord]] the carpet salesman, as [[Ron Greenwood]] told him "you're always on the floor").<ref>{{harvnb|Brooking|Hart|2014|p=40}}</ref> He lacked pace, leading to another nickname, Boog, after a slow [[baseball]] player called [[Boog Powell]] the team had witnessed during a tour of the US.<ref>{{harvnb|Brooking|Hart|2014|p=41}}</ref> He was rarely booked or sent off during his West Ham career and due to his gentlemanly approach to the game where he rarely contested a referee's decision he picked up another nickname, [[Hadleigh (TV series)|Hadleigh]], after a television [[upper class]] and urbane detective played by [[Gerald Harper]].<ref name=whustats/><ref name=Hadleigh>{{cite news |last=Coe |first=Sebastian |title=Government programme for sport delivered by Lottery |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/3035967/Government-programme-for-sport-delivered-by-Lottery.html# |access-date=17 September 2012 |newspaper=dailytelegraph.co.uk |date=12 October 2002}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
In April 2003, after West Ham manager [[Glenn Roeder]] collapsed due to a [[Brain tumor|brain tumour]], Brooking, having long been on the board at West Ham, briefly took over as caretaker manager. The club were fighting relegation from the [[Premier League]]. Brooking took charge of three games. His first game resulted in a 1–0 win at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] with a goal from [[Frédéric Kanouté]].<ref name=mcfc2003>{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Daniel |title=Kanoute injects fresh hope into West Ham |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/apr/28/match.manchestercity |access-date=18 September 2012 |newspaper=guardian.co.uk |date=28 April 2003}}</ref> His second saw West Ham beat [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 1–0, with a goal from [[Paolo Di Canio]].<ref name=whufccfc2003>{{cite news |title=Di Canio grabs West Ham lifeline |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2968013.stm |access-date=18 September 2012 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> The final game of the season saw West Ham draw 2–2 at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] resulting in relegation,<ref name=bcfcwhu2003>{{cite news |title=West Ham relegated |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2978071.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=18 September 2012}}</ref> albeit with 42 points, a record number for a relegated team in a 38-game season.<ref name=fortytwo>{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Jeremy |title='Survival Sunday' looms in what promises to be one of the tightest Premier League relegation battles ever |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/8362912/Survival-Sunday-looms-in-what-promises-to-be-one-of-the-tightest-Premier-League-relegation-battles-ever.html |access-date=12 August 2011 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=4 March 2011}}</ref> 

After the first three games of the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04 season]] with West Ham now in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], Roeder was sacked after West Ham suffered an away defeat to [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]]<ref name=Roedersacked>{{cite news |title=Roeder sacking inevitable |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/3178205.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=17 September 2012}}</ref> and Brooking was again installed as caretaker manager.

==Media career==
In 1984, Brooking joined the [[BBC]] as a pundit, and has featured on radio and television commentary since, including the BBC's ''[[Match of the Day]]'' and coverage of [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s and [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championships]]. He was also the co-commentator in the ''[[Pro Evolution Soccer]]'' video game series, alongside [[Peter Brackley]] until ''[[Pro Evolution Soccer 6]]''.

==Football administration==
Brooking was chair of the Eastern Region Council for Sport and Recreation from 1987 until 1997, and between 1999 and 2002 he was chairman of [[Sport England]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brooking|Hart|2014|p=1}}</ref> In January 2004, he joined [[the Football Association]] as Director of Football Development, a role which gave him control of coaching and development in English football, as well as a role in appointing future [[England national football team|England]] managers.<ref>{{harvnb|Brooking|Hart|2014|p=3}}</ref>

He was a key part of the selection process for the successor of [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]], revealed in May 2006 to be [[Steve McClaren]]. In 2004, he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] for his services to sport.<ref name="LG">{{London Gazette|issue=57315 |supp=y|page=1|date=12 June 2004}}</ref>

In 2009 West Ham United announced that from 8 August, the start of the [[2009–10 West Ham United F.C. season|2009–10 season]], 'The Centenary Stand' at [[Boleyn Ground]] would be named 'The Sir Trevor Brooking Stand' in his honour.<ref name=stand>{{cite web|title=Srand for Sir Trevor |url=http://www.whufc.com/page/News/0,,12562~1727112,00.html |publisher=West Ham United F.C.|work=WHUFC.com |access-date=23 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724154238/http://www.whufc.com/page/News/0,,12562~1727112,00.html |archive-date=24 July 2009 }}</ref> The stand was used by away supporters and had been the scene for crowd disturbances.

|quote=It is obviously a terrific honour (to have the stand named after me), which I am very grateful for because this is my club. It will be my club forever. The great thing was being able to spend my whole career with West Ham, having a stint as caretaker manager and as a director.
I still try and get to most of the home games. On my travels, if I am in a cab or something then everyone talks to me about West Ham because they know I am associated with the club. It is something I am only too pleased about whenever it happens. We have a very passionate and loyal support
