As a coach, Irvine worked in various roles at Blackburn Rovers, [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and Everton before becoming a manager, firstly with Preston and then [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. After three years in charge of the [[Everton F.C. Reserves and Academy|Everton Academy]], he became head coach of [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]. He rejoined Blackburn as assistant manager in November 2015, and was later caretaker manager of [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and assistant manager at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. In 2025, he returned to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] as assistant manager.

The match ended in a 2–2 draw, relegating Wednesday to [[EFL League One|League One]].<ref>{{Cite news

Wednesday then had severe financial issues, with the club appearing in court twice over winding up orders. Following the successful takeover by [[Milan Mandarić]] at the end of 2010, Irvine was allowed transfer funds to revamp his squad.
