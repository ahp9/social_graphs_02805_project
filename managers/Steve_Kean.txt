'''Stephen Kean''' (born 30 September 1967) is a Scottish [[Association football|football]] coach and former player who is the manager of Georgian club [[FC Torpedo Kutaisi|Torpedo Kutaisi]]. Kean played as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for clubs in the lower divisions of Scottish, English and Portuguese leagues in the 1980s and 1990s, before moving into coaching. After a 21-month spell in charge of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], he resigned on 28 September 2012.

==Playing career==
Kean grew up in [[Cumbernauld]], a new town on the outskirts of [[Glasgow]], attending St. Maurice's High School. Upon leaving school, he joined [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] as a professional, but was unable to break into a first team then dominated by Celtic legends [[Tommy Burns (footballer)|Tommy Burns]], [[Murdo MacLeod]] and [[Paul McStay]].

He joined [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] on loan in 1987,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/swansea/swansea.html|access-date=9 October 2010|publisher=Post War English & Scottish Football League A–Z Player's Database|title=Swansea City: 1946/47 – 2009/10|archive-date=6 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406080816/http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/swansea/swansea.html|url-status=live}}</ref> at the same time as [[Chris Coleman (footballer)|Chris Coleman]]. They formed a lasting professional relationship, which carried on after both of their playing days had ended.

Kean then played for [[Associação Académica de Coimbra – O.A.F.|Académica Coimbra]] in Portugal, making nine appearances, and scoring one goal in all competitions.<ref name="Statistics">{{cite web |url=http://www.veteranosaac.com/index.php?menu=31&listar_tipo=jog_nomealc&ordenar=ASC&letra=S |title=Statistics |publisher=Veteranosaac.com |access-date=8 May 2012 |language=pt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103111713/http://www.veteranosaac.com/index.php?menu=31&listar_tipo=jog_nomealc&ordenar=ASC&letra=S |archive-date=3 November 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Kean linked to Chelsea coach role"/><ref>{{ForaDeJogo|196709300003}}</ref> During his time in Portugal, Kean also played for [[Associação Naval 1º de Maio|Naval]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcoachesabroad.com/new-steve-kean-interview/|access-date=12 May 2019|publisher=The British Coaches Abroad Association|title=New: Steve Kean interview!|archive-date=11 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190511234653/http://www.britishcoachesabroad.com/new-steve-kean-interview/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Coaching and management career==
[[File:Steve Kean (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Kean with Coventry City in 2008]]

===Coaching career===
Since retiring from playing Kean has worked as a coach for [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], [[Real Sociedad]] and [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], working as an assistant to [[Chris Coleman (footballer)|Chris Coleman]] at Fulham, Real Sociedad and Coventry.<ref name="Kean linked to Chelsea coach role">{{cite news|title=Kean linked to Chelsea coach role|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/7462555.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 June 2008|access-date=19 June 2008|archive-date=15 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915112435/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/7462555.stm|url-status=live}}</ref>

In June 2008, it was reported that Kean was in talks with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] to become assistant manager to [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]].<ref name="Kean linked to Chelsea coach role"/> Kean's fluency in Portuguese from his playing days was believed to be a key reason for Chelsea's interest.<ref name="Kean linked to Chelsea coach role"/>

===Blackburn Rovers===
On 4 August 2009, [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] manager [[Sam Allardyce]] appointed Kean as his new first team coach. Kean replaced [[Karl Robinson]] who returned to [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]]. Allardyce commented that he had received numerous applications for the first team coaching position and Kean "stood out above the rest through his personality, experience and knowledge of football at the highest level".<ref name="stoodout">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/blackburn-rovers/8201129/Who-is-Blackburns-interim-manager-Steve-Kean.html | title=Who is Blackburn's interim manager Steve Kean? | work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London | date=14 December 2010 | access-date=16 January 2012}}</ref>

After the sacking of Allardyce on 13 December 2010 by new Blackburn owners [[Venky's]], Kean was initially installed as [[caretaker manager]] but on 22 December 2010, he was appointed manager on a contract until the end of the season to prove his abilities in that position.<ref name="Blackburn Rovers sack manager Sam Allardyce">{{cite news|title=Blackburn Rovers sack manager Sam Allardyce|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/blackburn_rovers/9283395.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 December 2010|access-date=18 December 2010|archive-date=12 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112211747/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/blackburn_rovers/9283395.stm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Steve Kean put in charge by Blackburn">{{cite news|title=Steve Kean put in charge by Blackburn|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/blackburn_rovers/9313502.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 December 2010|access-date=22 December 2010|archive-date=27 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220727175214/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/blackburn_rovers/9313502.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> On 4 January 2011, it was revealed by Anuradha Desai, chairperson of Venky's, that Kean would be offered a new two-to-three-year long-term contract to manage the club and on 20 January 2011, it was confirmed by Blackburn that Kean had signed a contract until June 2013.<ref name="Kean to land long-term deal">{{Cite news|title=Kean to land long-term deal|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11676_6634005,00.html|publisher=Sky Sports|date=4 January 2011|access-date=5 January 2011|archive-date=21 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021184021/http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11676_6634005,00.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Kean signs contract to June 2013">{{Cite news |title=Kean signs contract to June 2013 |url=http://www.rovers.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10303~2271940,00.html |publisher=Blackburn Rovers F.C. |date=20 January 2011 |access-date=20 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915041340/http://www.rovers.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10303~2271940,00.html |archive-date=15 September 2012 }}</ref> Kean's appointment was shrouded in a great deal of controversy since his agent [[Jerome Anderson (football agent)|Jerome Anderson]] had earlier played a major role in advising Venky's during the takeover of the club in the preceding months.<ref name= "How an agent came to hold so much power at Blackburn Rovers">Conn, David.

Kean started brightly as manager, but [[2010–11 Blackburn Rovers F.C. season#February|ten games without a win]] saw Rovers dragged into relegation trouble. A 15th-place finish was secured with a 3–2 win over [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on the final day of the [[2010–11 Premier League]] season.

In November 2011, Blackburn confirmed that Kean had signed a new contract with improved terms, despite the club being in the bottom place of the league. This came despite Kean's comments less than a week earlier stating: "Yes, there have been discussions about a new contract, but I have told the owners that this is an inappropriate time to conclude any new contract discussions".<ref name="Steve Kean contradicts earlier statement he made to ESPN">{{Cite news|title=Rovers confirm Kean contract revision|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/987457/blackburn-rovers-confirm-steve-kean-contract-revision?cc=5739|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127075124/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/987457/blackburn-rovers-confirm-steve-kean-contract-revision?cc=5739|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 November 2011|publisher=ESPNsoccernet|date=23 November 2011 |access-date=23 November 2011}}</ref> The new deal came after months of protests at the club in which fans campaigned to have Kean removed as Rovers manager as he had recorded just one league win all season.<ref name="Anti-Steve Kean banner flown by Blackburn Rovers fans ">{{cite news|title=Anti-Steve Kean banner flown by Blackburn Rovers fans |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/15609898|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 November 2011 |access-date=23 November 2011}}</ref> At the time, Steve Kean was Blackburn Rovers' second worst manager since 1992, with only [[Paul Ince]] scoring a lower win percentage.<ref name="Kean out?

Further controversy was created when Kean admitted 'forfeiting' a [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] quarter-final at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] for the sake of their league form, with fans subsequently demanding a refund for the ticket price, travel expenses and money lost due to not working on the day.<ref name="Blackburn boss Steve Kean admits Carling Cup 'forfeit' at Cardiff">{{Cite news|title=Blackburn boss Steve Kean admits Carling Cup 'forfeit' at Cardiff|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/15957699|publisher=BBC|date=30 November 2011 |access-date=11 September 2016}}</ref><ref name="Rovers fans demand refund after Kean admits to 'forfeiting' Cup game">{{Cite news|title=Rovers fans demand refund after Kean admits to 'forfeiting' Cup game|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/blackburn-fans-demand-refund-after-3314433|work=The Mirror|date=30 November 2011 |access-date=11 September 2016}}</ref> In December 2011, the [[Lancashire Telegraph|local newspaper]] and MP [[Jack Straw]] joined the fans in calling for Kean's resignation ahead of a crucial home match with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].<ref name="Time to go Steve Kean">{{cite news|title=Lancashire Telegraph comment: Time to go Steve Kean|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/9427073.Lancashire_Telegraph_comment__Time_to_go_Steve|newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph|date=19 December 2011|access-date=11 September 2016|archive-date=30 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030225712/http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/9427073.Lancashire_Telegraph_comment__Time_to_go_Steve/|url-status=live}}</ref> Another defeat concluded Kean's first 38 league games as Blackburn manager in which he had amassed just 32 points and left Rovers [[Premier League–Football League gulf#Curse of Christmas|bottom of the table at Christmas]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Blackburn Rovers 1-2 Bolton Wanderers, 20th December 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16154249|publisher=BBC|date=20 December 2011|access-date=11 September 2016|archive-date=5 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005232705/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16154249|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite all of this, Kean remained defiant by insisting that he would stay in his job long enough to fashion a revival and that he would be "100% shocked" if he was sacked.<ref name="Under-fire Kean banking on season of goodwill">{{Cite news|title=Under-fire Kean banking on season of goodwill|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philmcnulty/2011/12/under-fire_kean_banking_on_sea.html|publisher=BBC|date=21 December 2011|access-date=11 September 2016|archive-date=10 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010052608/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philmcnulty/2011/12/under-fire_kean_banking_on_sea.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Blackburn Rovers boss Steve Kean '100% shocked' if he was sacked">{{Cite news|title=Blackburn Rovers boss Steve Kean '100% shocked' if he was sacked|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16279663|publisher=BBC|date=20 December 2011|access-date=11 September 2016|archive-date=24 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210524160101/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16279663|url-status=live}}</ref>

Results were somewhat improved in the second half of the season but [[2011–12 Blackburn Rovers F.C. season#Matches|five successive defeats]] in April dragged Rovers deep into relegation trouble again with Kean having recorded just 12 wins from his 55 league games since he took over.

Kean left his position as Rovers' manager on 28 September 2012 with the club third in the Championship table.
