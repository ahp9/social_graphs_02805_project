===VfR Aalen===
[[File:Ralph Hasenhüttl.jpg|thumb|upright|Hasenhüttl with VfR Aalen in May 2012, celebrating the club's promotion to the [[2. Bundesliga]]]]
In January 2011, Hasenhüttl succeeded [[Rainer Scharinger]] as the coach of third division [[VfR Aalen]],<ref name="Aalen record">{{cite web|title=VfR Aalen|url=https://www.kicker.de/vfr-aalen/team-trainer/3-liga/2016-17|publisher=kicker|access-date=22 September 2016|language=de}}</ref> then in 16th place, one point above the relegation zone.

Liga earned him a year's contract extension. In the 2011–12 season, he completely rebuilt the team, bringing in eight new players and releasing 14, with the aim of a mid-table finish.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} After a slow start to the season, the team found itself in sixth place at the winter break, only a point behind the play-off position. The team's run continued into the second half of the season, which included an eight-game winning streak, earning Hasenhüttl a further two-year contract extension in November 2011. At the end of the season, Aalen finished in second place, earning automatic promotion to the [[2. Bundesliga]].

During pre-season training in the summer of 2012, Hasenhüttl contracted a [[Hantavirus]] infection, but returned to work three weeks into the 2012–13 season. Hasenhüttl had switched from a 4–4–2 to a 4–5–1 formation, to facilitate a fast, counter-attacking game, with success. By the winter break, Aalen were in fifth place. The team finished the season in ninth place, the highest of the newly promoted teams. After two-and-a-half successful years at Aalen, Hasenhüttl resigned in June 2013,<ref name="Ralph Hasenhüttl verlässt VfR Aalen">{{cite web |title=Ralph Hasenhüttl verlässt VfR Aalen |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/fussball-ralph-hasenhuettl-verlaesst-vfr-aalen/8287298.html |work=Der Tagesspiegel |date=2 June 2013 |access-date=19 August 2013 |language=de}}</ref> when Aalen lost its main sponsor and sporting director [[Markus Schupp]] imposed an austerity programme for the following season, with several departing players not being replaced.

===Ingolstadt 04===
In October 2013, Hasenhüttl was appointed as coach of [[FC Ingolstadt 04|Ingolstadt 04]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Ingolstadt verpflichtet Hasenhüttel |url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/zweite-bundesliga-fc-ingolstadt-verpflichtet-hasenhuettel-a-926181.html |work=Spiegel Online |date=4 October 2013 |access-date=10 October 2013 |language=de}}</ref> replacing [[Marco Kurz]].

==Coaching style==
Like [[Jürgen Klopp]], Hasenhüttl is a notable proponent of ''Gegenpressing'', a tactic in which the team, after losing possession of the ball, immediately attempts to win back possession, rather than falling back to regroup. This has seen him nicknamed "The Alpine Klopp".<ref name="Alpine Klopp">{{cite web |last1=Aarons |first1=Ed |title=Ralph Hasenhüttl: the 'Alpine Klopp' who admits he is a little bit crazy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/06/ralph-hasenhuttl-alpine-klopp-southampton-manager-crazy |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 December 2018 |access-date=28 January 2021 |ref=Alpine Klopp}}</ref>

In his first season at Southampton, he initially used a 3-5-2, switching to his preferred 4-2-2-2 mid-way into his second season, as he had previously implemented at RB Leipzig.<ref name="RB Leipzig tactics">{{cite web |last1=Askew |first1=Joshua |title=Given Red Bull's wings: RB Leipzig 2016/17 |url=https://www.holdingmidfield.com/given-red-bulls-wings-rb-leipzig-201617/ |website=holdingmidfield.com |date=8 September 2017 |publisher=Holding Midfield |access-date=27 January 2021 |ref=RB Leipzig tactics}}</ref> However, in the 2021–22 season he began sometimes using 3-5-2 and 3-4-3 formations in order to gain more tactical flexibility against different opponents. {{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

He outlined what he wants to see from his team as "Pressing. Hunting. Be hungry. When you have the ball, find a quick decision, quick transition to the front. It's about being emotional, being full of passion. Also, keep the tempo on a high level and don't slow down the game. That's what I think the people want to see."<ref name="Southampton tactics">{{cite web |last1=Askew |first1=Joshua |title=Ralph Hasenhuttl's Southampton |url=https://www.holdingmidfield.com/ralph-hasenhuttl-southampton-tactics-tactical-analysis/ |website=holdingmidfield.com |date=7 February 2020 |publisher=Holding Midfield |access-date=28 January 2021 |ref=Southampton tactics}}</ref>

==Personal life==
His son [[Patrick Hasenhüttl|Patrick]] was born in [[Mechelen]] in 1997, while Ralph was playing for [[K.V. Mechelen]], playing as a forward before his retirement for health reasons in March 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |date=17 February 2016 |title=Hasenhüttl in Hasenhüttls Fußstapfen |url=https://www.kicker.de/hasenhuettl-in-hasenhuettls-fussstapfen-645425/artikel |access-date=25 September 2020 |website=kicker |language=de-DE}}</ref>
