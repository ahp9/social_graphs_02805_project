'''Enzo Maresca''' (born 10 February 1980) is an Italian professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Football player|player]]. He is the head coach of [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

After starting out at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in 1998, he went on to play for several clubs in his country, including [[Juventus FC|Juventus]], who loaned him twice for the duration of his contract and with whom he won the league title in 2002. After being released in 2004, he went to play one season with [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]]. He then resumed his career in [[La Liga]] with [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] (where he remained for four years) and [[Málaga CF|Málaga]], appearing in 134 games and scoring 17 goals in the competition after winning five major titles with Sevilla. In between his two spells in Spain, he also spent one year in Greece with [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]]. In 2012, he returned to Italy, where he played until his retirement in 2017, totalling 140 appearances and 17 goals in [[Serie A]].

Maresca represented Italy at youth level, including the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy under-21 team]], but was never capped at senior level.

Upon his retirement, Maresca served as an assistant manager at [[Ascoli Picchio F.C. 1898|Ascoli]] under Fulvio Fiorin for the [[2017–18 Serie B]] season, and subsequently served as manager of the [[Manchester City F.C. EDS and Academy|Manchester City U23 side]], leading the team to the 2020–21 [[Professional Development League|Premier League 2]] title. He began his professional managerial career with Italian [[Serie B]] side [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] in 2021, but was sacked later that year. He then returned to English side [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 2022, serving as an assistant manager under manager [[Pep Guardiola]]. He later managed [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] during [[2023–24 EFL Championship|2023–24 season]], leading the club to the [[EFL Championship]], and earning promotion to the Premier League. The following season, he joined Chelsea, leading them to the [[2024–25 UEFA Conference League]] title, his second trophy as a manager, also finishing fourth in the league and qualifying for the Champions League. His third trophy as a manager came when he led Chelsea to the [[2025 FIFA Club World Cup]] title.

==Club career==
===Early years===
Born in [[Pontecagnano Faiano]], Province of Salerno, Maresca started playing football at the age of 11 with [[A.C. Milan]] and joined [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] after three years.{{citation needed|date=December 2024}}

Maresca began his professional career with English club [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], despite having "no grasp of the English language".<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/66868576|title=Maresca 'not scared' of fresh start with Leicester|publisher=BBC Sport|first1=Andrew|last1=Aloia|first2=Charlie|last2=Slater|date=22 September 2023|access-date=13 July 2025}}</ref> He made his debut in a 2–0 home defeat against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] on 20 September 1998, and played two incomplete seasons with the English club in the [[Football League First Division]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/sporting-digest-football-1200109.html|title=Sporting Digest: Football|work=[[The Independent]]|date=22 September 1998|access-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>

===Juventus===
In January 2000, Maresca moved back to Italy and joined [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] in a [[Transfer (association football)|transfer]] worth [[Pound sterling|£]]4.3 million, a club-record sale for Albion at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/625894.stm|title=Carbone future on the line|publisher=BBC Sport|date=31 January 2000|access-date=13 July 2025}}</ref> He played in one [[Serie A]] game before the end of [[1999–2000 Serie A|the season]].

For two of the following three seasons, Maresca was loaned to fellow league teams [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] and [[Piacenza Calcio|Piacenza]]—a [[Co-ownership (football)|co-ownership]] deal in the latter case—scoring nine goals in the [[2002–03 Serie A|2002–03 season]] but suffering team relegation. During [[2001–02 Serie A|the previous campaign]], he notably netted an important equaliser in the [[Derby della Mole]] return leg, against neighbouring [[Torino F.C.|Torino]]; he attracted controversy, however, when he celebrated the goal by mimicking Torino's [[Marco Ferrante]]'s earlier "bull-horn" [[goal celebration]] (the bull being a club symbol as it is [[Turin]]'s coat of arms, and the side also being known in its contracted form as "Toro", bull in Italian).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/calcio_partite/torinojuventus/torinojuventus/torinojuventus.html|title=Gol, nervi tesi ed emozioni il derby ferma la Juve|trans-title=Goals, bundle of nerves and excitement Juve closes derby|publisher=[[La Repubblica]]|language=it|date=24 February 2002|access-date=23 April 2015}}</ref> Juventus subsequently bought the remaining 50% of his rights for [[Euro|€]]2.6 million.<ref>[http://www.juventus.com/site/filesite/finance/bilanci_relazioni/28_ott_2003_eng.pdf Reports and financial statements at 30 June 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207050005/http://www.juventus.com/site/filesite/finance/bilanci_relazioni/28_ott_2003_eng.pdf |date=7 December 2008 }}; Juventus FC, 2003</ref>

He made his official debut on 12 September, playing 60 minutes in a 0–1 away defeat to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]].

At the end of [[2004–05 Serie A|the season]], with the ''Viola'' narrowly avoiding top level relegation, Juventus bought back all three for around €6.7&nbsp;million in a blind auction between the clubs.<ref>[http://www.juventus.com/site/filesite/finance/bilanci_relazioni/25_ott_2005_eng.pdf Reports and financial statements at 30 June 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207051212/http://www.juventus.com/site/filesite/finance/bilanci_relazioni/25_ott_2005_eng.pdf |date=7 December 2008 }}; Juventus FC, 2005</ref> Maresca's cost was of only about €7,000,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/wps/wcm/connect/ffc1b37b-2161-4268-b321-cf9587f167e9/24_mar_2006_eng.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=ffc1b37b-2161-4268-b321-cf9587f167e9 |title=Six-monthly report at 31 December 2005 |publisher=Juventus FC |date=24 March 2006 |access-date=6 August 2013 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> but an additional €420,000 agent fee in order to keep the player was also involved.
