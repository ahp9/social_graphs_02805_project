In June 2005, Appleton announced that he was going to [[Lawsuit|sue]] the [[surgeon]] who he believed had ended his career early. The surgeon's name was not announced, and the case was set to start in early 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_bromwich_albion/4117138.stm |title=Ex-West Brom star to sue surgeon |access-date=23 March 2007 |date=21 June 2005 |website=BBC Sport}}</ref> In June, West Bromwich Albion began a £1&nbsp;million compensation claim against knee specialist Medhet Mohammed El-Safty, whom the club described as "negligent".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/5104444.stm |title=West Brom sue 'negligent' surgeon |access-date=23 March 2007 |date=21 June 2006 |website=BBC News}}</ref> If West Bromwich Albion had won the case, it could result in many similar cases, the appeal court was told.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/5107406.stm |title=Warning over football club claim |access-date=23 March 2007 |date=22 June 2006 |website=BBC News}}</ref>

Appleton's case against Mr El-Safty was heard by [[John Royce|Mr Justice Royce]], a [[Judge|High Court judge]], in Manchester, with evidence provided by Appleton's former manager [[Alex Ferguson]] and former teammates [[Ryan Giggs]] and [[Gary Neville]]. Appleton won his case,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6296203.stm |title=Player must wait on surgery claim |access-date=23 March 2007 |date=24 January 2007 |website=BBC News}}</ref> and on 23 March 2007 he was awarded £1.5&nbsp;million in damages – thought to be one of the biggest pay-outs to an English footballer<ref>{{cite web|first=Neil |last=Barker |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/s/1595096_michael-appleton-i-learned-so-much-from-sir-alex-ferguson?rss=yes |title=Michael Appleton: I learned so much from Sir Alex Ferguson|newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=3 December 2012 |access-date=9 January 2013}}</ref> – as El-Safty had admitted he wrongly operated on him.
