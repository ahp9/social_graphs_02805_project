==Playing career==
===Club career===
Born in [[Montevideo]],<ref name=BDFutbol/> a goalscoring midfielder, he began his career with spells at [[Grenoble Foot 38|Grenoble]] and [[Club Atlético River Plate (Uruguay)|River Plate]]. Poyet moved to [[Real Zaragoza]] in 1990; winning the [[Copa del Rey]] in 1994 and the [[1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|Cup Winners' Cup]] a [[1994–95 Real Zaragoza season|year later]], beating [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the final.<ref>{{cite news |title=Extraordinary Nayim strike denies Arsenal |first=Glenn |last=Moore |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/extraordinary-nayim-strike-denies-arsenal-1619106.html |work=Independent.co.uk |date=11 May 1995 |access-date=27 April 2012 |location=London}}</ref> He became Zaragoza's longest-serving foreign player, and scored 60 goals in 240 games for the club.

Poyet joined Chelsea on a free transfer in June 1997. Not long into his first season at the London club, he suffered [[cruciate ligament]] damage, this meant he missed the victorious [[1998 Football League Cup Final]] but recovered to play in the team's successful Cup Winners' Cup Final against [[VfB Stuttgart]]. The following year, he contributed 14 goals – making him the club's second highest scorer – to help Chelsea finish third in the [[FA Premier League|Premiership]], including a crucial headed goal in 1–0 win against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Chelsea book Champions League spot |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/336382.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=5 May 1999 |access-date=28 April 2012}}</ref> He also scored the winner for Chelsea in the [[1998 UEFA Super Cup]] against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Poyet secures Super Cup |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/160584.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 August 1998 |access-date=28 April 2012}}</ref> In [[1999–2000 in English football|1999–2000]], he scored 18 goals (which again made him Chelsea's second highest scorer), with a scissors-kick volley against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Chelsea open season in style |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/414261.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=7 August 1999 |access-date=28 April 2012}}</ref> a long range strike against [[S.S.
