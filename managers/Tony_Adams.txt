'''Tony Alexander Adams''' (born 10 October 1966) is an English former [[Association football|football]] manager and player. Adams played for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[England national football team|England]], captaining both teams. Known as '''"Mr. Arsenal"''', he spent his [[List of one-club men in association football|entire playing career]] of 19 years as a [[centre-back]] there, making 672 total appearances and winning four English league titles. He is considered one of Arsenal's greatest ever players,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gunners Greatest 50 Players |url=https://www.arsenal.com/history/gunners-greatest-50-players |access-date=10 April 2023 |website=Arsenal.com}}</ref> and is also included in the [[Football League 100 Legends]].

With Arsenal, he won four top flight division titles, uniquely captaining a title-winning team in three different decades, three [[FA Cup]]s, two [[Football League Cup]]s, a [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] and two [[FA Community Shield]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/48327172|title = Where does Kompany rank among Premier League leaders?|work = BBC Sport}}</ref> Adams is one of six people honoured with a statue outside the [[Emirates Stadium]], Arsenal's home ground. He won 66 caps for [[England national football team|England]] between 1987 and 2000, and played at four major tournaments.

When his playing career finished, Adams went into football management, spending periods in charge of [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Azerbaijan]]i side [[Gabala FK|Gabala]] and Spanish side [[Granada CF|Granada]].

From early in his career Adams was an alcoholic off the field, and after crashing his car was sentenced to four months in prison for driving while four times over the limit for blood alcohol. From 1996 he recovered completely, and became involved in helping sportspeople with drink, drug or gambling addictions, founding the [[Sporting Chance Clinic]].<ref name=interview24>{{cite interview| last=Adams| first=Tony| title='Prison didn't touch the sides': Tony Adams on addiction, losing the man who saved him and helping others|interviewer=Michael Butler|newspaper=The Observer| date=1 December 2024 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/01/prison-didnt-touch-the-sides-tony-adams-on-addiction-losing-the-man-who-saved-him-and-helping-others}}</ref>

==Early life==
Born in [[Romford]], Adams grew up in [[Dagenham]] and was a pupil at Hunters Hall Primary School from 1971 to 1978 and then [[Eastbrook Comprehensive School]] from 1978 to 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/MuseumsAndHeritage/LocalHistoryResources/Documents/Infosheet52FootballpersonalitiesofBD.pdf|title=Football personalities of Barking and Dagenham|publisher=London Borough of Barking & Dagengham|access-date=22 February 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605124917/http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/MuseumsAndHeritage/LocalHistoryResources/Documents/Infosheet52FootballpersonalitiesofBD.pdf|archive-date=5 June 2012}}</ref> His cousin is fellow professional footballer [[Steve MacKenzie]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nacoa.org.uk/news-and-events/news/2015/10/19/personal-experiences/ |title=Tony Adams, Lauren Booth, Geraldine James and Elle Macpherson share experience, strength and hopes |publisher=nacoa.org.uk |date=19 October 2015 |access-date=12 July 2019 |archive-date=12 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190712115328/http://nacoa.org.uk/news-and-events/news/2015/10/19/personal-experiences/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Club career==

=== 1983–1989: Early career and Anfield title ===
Adams signed for Arsenal as a schoolboy in 1980,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-02-15 |title=Tony Adams |url=https://www.arsenal.com/historic/players/tony-adams |access-date=2025-02-09 |website=www.arsenal.com |language=en}}</ref> and made his first-team debut on 5 November 1983 against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], aged 17.<ref name=":1">Maidment (2008), p. 54.</ref><ref name="highs" /> He accidentally put his shorts on back-to-front before the match. Then, with virtually his first touch of the ball during the game, he gave it away, leading to Sunderland's opening goal. He put the ball into the opponents' net, but the goal was disallowed.<ref name=":1" /> Adams became a regular player in the [[1986–87 in English football|1986–87 season]], winning his first major trophy that season when playing in the [[Football League Cup]] Final win over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].<ref name="highs" />

On 1 January 1988, he became Arsenal captain at the age of 21,<ref name="greatest">{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-greatest-players-no-3.-tony-adams|title=Gunners' Greatest Players – 3. Tony Adams|author=Arsenal.com|work=Official Arsenal Website|date=5–19 May 2008|access-date=24 November 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212013429/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-greatest-players-no-3.-tony-adams|archive-date=12 December 2008}}</ref> remaining as club captain for the next 14 years until his retirement.

Adams's strong discipline of the defence was considered a factor in Arsenal winning the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[1986–87 in English football|1986–87]] and then the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] championship twice; the first in [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]] after a [[Liverpool 0–2 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|win]] over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the final game of the season; the second in [[1990–91 in English football|1990–91]], losing once all season.

=== 1989–1996: Arsenal's famous back four ===
Together with [[Lee Dixon]], [[Nigel Winterburn]] and [[Steve Bould]], Adams was part of the "famous back four" that lined up in Arsenal's defence, which under [[George Graham (footballer, born 1944)|George Graham]] was renowned for its well-disciplined use of the [[offside trap]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Smyth |first=Rob |date=2009-05-08 |title=The Joy of Six: Great defences |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/may/08/joy-of-six-great-defences |access-date=2024-05-09 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The backline achieved legendary status with its unyielding resilience, remaining formidable for over a decade. Arsenal notably conceded just 18 goals during their title-winning [[1990–91 Arsenal F.C. season|1990–91 league season]], and the four players amassed over 2,000 appearances for the club.<ref>Maidment (2008), p. 75.</ref>

In [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93]] Adams was the captain of the first English side to win the League Cup and [[FA Cup]] double.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joe Lovejoy |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--european-cupwinners-cup-smiths-strike-brings-arsenal-european-glory-battling-londoners-make-light-of-the-loss-of-wright-and-jensen-1433888.html |title=European Cup-Winners Cup: Smith's strike brings Arsenal European glory: Battling Londoners make light of the loss of Wright and Jensen |work=The Independent|date=5 May 1994 |access-date=6 December 2020}}</ref> In 1994, Adams led Arsenal to their first European trophy in 24 years by defeating favourites [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] 1–0 in the [[1994 European Cup Winners' Cup final]] in Copenhagen.<ref>Maidment (2008), p. 67.</ref>

Despite this success, [[alcoholism]] increasingly blighted his life from the mid-1980s. He was reportedly often involved in fights in [[nightclub]]s, and on 6 May 1990 crashed his car into a wall in [[Rayleigh, Essex|Rayleigh]]; his blood alcohol level was found to be more than four times the legal [[Drunk driving law by country#United Kingdom|drink-drive limit]]. On 19 December that year, at [[Southend Crown Court]],<ref name="greatest" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.askmen.com/top_10/sports/top-10-stupid-criminal-acts-by-footballers_4.html|title=Tony Adams|publisher=Ask Men|access-date=22 February 2014|archive-date=16 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181216031322/https://uk.askmen.com/top_10/sports/top-10-stupid-criminal-acts-by-footballers_4.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=519627|title=Stick Your Two Points Up Your Arsenal|first=Tim|last=Stillman|publisher=Vital Football|date=25 July 2010|archive-date=25 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925230420/http://www.arsenal.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=519627|url-status=dead}}</ref> he was sentenced to four months in prison, and freed after half of his sentence on 15 February 1991,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Watts |first1=Charles |title=27 years on: The inside story of Tony Adams' return from prison as told by those who were there |url=https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/news/arsenal-news-tony-adams-highbury-14297249 |access-date=12 October 2022 |publisher=Football London |date=16 February 2018}}</ref> but continued drinking for another six years. Adams in a 2024 interview said that in early 1996, aged 29, he was in a very dark period, not wanting to live when not playing football, unable to "do life". He was injured that February, removing football. One Sunday evening he drank seven bottles of [[Chablis wine|chablis]], so his (first) mother-in-law took the children.<ref name=interview24/>

From mid-1996, with help from a man he named only as "James W",<ref name=interview24/> he became one of the most high-profile [[recovering alcoholic]]s in the UK;<ref name="ias">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ias.org.uk/What-we-do/Publication-archive/Alcohol-Alert/Issue-3-1998/Adams-turns-his-back-on-alcohol.aspx|title=Adams turns his back on alcohol - review of Adams's ''Addicted''|author=Paul Whittaker|journal=Alcohol Alert|issue=1998–3|publisher=Institute of Alcohol Studies|date=March 1998}}</ref> his battle with alcohol is detailed in his [[autobiography]], ''Addicted'', which was released in May 1998 to critical acclaim.<ref name="ias" /> ''BBC News'' reported in 2001 that he had become [[teetotalism|tee-total]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Battling the booze|work=[[BBC News]]|date=4 October 2001|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1578718.stm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728050312/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1578718.stm|archive-date=28 July 2017}}</ref>

}}Six weeks into Adams's sobriety, [[Arsène Wenger]] arrived as Arsenal manager in October 1996. Adams reflected in 2020 that Wenger understood his psychology, and knew of the dangers of alcohol, as his parents ran a pub.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wrack |first1=Susy |title=Tony Adams: 'Alcohol gave me a good hiding – I needed a lot of pain' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/31/tony-adams-alcohol-gave-me-good-hiding-i-needed-pain-sporting-chance-arsenal |access-date=12 October 2022 |work=The Guardian |date=31 January 2020}}</ref> Adams rewarded his manager's understanding handsomely, captaining the club to two [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] and FA Cup [[Double (association football)|Doubles]], in [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]] and [[2001–02 in English football|2001–02]].<ref name="highs">{{cite news |title=Tony Adams' career highs and lows |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/feb/09/tony-adams-career-profile-portsmouth |access-date=12 October 2022 |work=The Guardian |date=9 February 2009}}</ref>

In August 2002, just before the start of the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03]] season, Adams retired from professional football after a career spanning almost 20 years, his last match being the [[2002 FA Cup Final]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ridley |first1=Ian |title=Adams: the next chapter |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/aug/11/newsstory.sport12 |access-date=12 October 2022 |work=The Guardian |date=11 August 2002}}</ref> He played 674 matches for Arsenal (only [[David O'Leary]] has played more) and was the most successful captain in the club's history. The number 6 shirt that Adams wore when playing was not used again until the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07 season]], when it was assigned to [[Philippe Senderos]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mannion |first1=Damian |title=From Ronaldo to Owen, Dalglish to Clough, Adams to Senderos: famous numbers worn by crap players |url=https://talksport.com/uncategorized/143783/ronaldo-owen-dalglish-clough-adams-senderos-famous-numbers-worn-crap-pla-175835/ |access-date=12 October 2022 |publisher=Talksport |date=4 July 2012}}</ref>

Just before his retirement as a player, Adams had applied to become manager of [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] (who had just missed out on promotion to Division One) after the resignation of [[Steve Coppell]], but his application was rejected.<ref>{{cite news

Nicknamed "Mr Arsenal", he was honoured by Arsenal with a testimonial game against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in May 2002 with many Arsenal legends playing, including [[Ian Wright]], [[John Lukic]] and Adams's fellow back four stalwarts, Dixon, Winterburn and Bould. The game finished 1–1 with Lee Dixon, in his final appearance for the Gunners, getting their goal.<ref name="testimonial">{{cite news |last=Brodkin |first=Jon |date=14 May 2002 |title=A night out for the Adams family |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/may/14/newsstory.sport1 |access-date=28 October 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London}}</ref> In March 2003, just seven months after his retirement and with Arsenal [[BBC Sport]] named Adams as the former Arsenal player that the club would most benefit from returning.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2872203.stm | work=BBC News | title=Blast from the past: Part one | date=24 March 2003 | first=Tom | last=Fordyce}}</ref>

In 2004, Adams was inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his impact on the English game, and in 2008 he was placed third in the 50 Greatest Gunners poll on the club's website.

==International career==

Adams made his debut for [[England national football team|England]] against [[Spain men's national football team|Spain]] in 1987,<ref name="highs" /> and played in [[UEFA Euro 1988]]. England lost all three games, but Adams scored one of England's two goals in the tournament in a 3–1 defeat to the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]]. He was the first player to represent England who had been born after the 1966 World Cup win.

After a highly promising start to his international career, Adams suffered a series of setbacks during the early 1990s. He was surprisingly left out of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] squad by manager [[Bobby Robson]],<ref name="highs" /> missed [[UEFA Euro 1992]] due to injury, whilst England failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. England reached the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1996]], before losing on [[penalty shootout (football)|penalties]] to [[Germany national football team|Germany]].

Adams appeared at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. Later that year, he made headlines for several statements in his autobiography ''Addicted'', criticising manager [[Glenn Hoddle]] for his management of [[David Beckham]] and [[Paul Gascoigne]], and for making [[Alan Shearer]] captain instead of Adams; he also called Gascoigne an alcoholic, which was denied by the player's representatives. Hoddle told the press that he had no problems with Adams's opinions from the book.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hoddle and Adams 'closer than ever' |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/163111.stm |access-date=12 October 2022 |publisher=BBC News |date=9 September 1998}}</ref>

His international swansong was England's unsuccessful [[UEFA Euro 2000]] campaign. With Shearer retiring from international football after the tournament, Adams regained the captaincy. However, within months, England lost a World Cup qualifier to Germany in October 2000, the match being the last to be staged at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], before the stadium was torn down for rebuilding. That match was Adams's 60th Wembley appearance, a record. With [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] eventually taking the helm and under increasing pressure for his place from the emerging and improving [[Rio Ferdinand]], Adams retired from international football, having made 66 appearances,<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.rsssf.org/miscellaneous/adams-intl.html| title = Tony Alexander Adams – International Appearances| access-date = 24 October 2008}}</ref> before Eriksson picked his first squad. He was the last England player to score at the old Wembley Stadium when he scored England's second goal in a 2–0 friendly win over [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] on 31 May 2000. This was also his first goal since he scored in a friendly against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in November 1988, thus making the record for the longest gap between goals for England.

==Style of play==
Described as a "stopper" (or man–marking defender) by Tom Sheen of ''The Guardian'' in 2014, Adams played as a centre-back. A tall, brave, rugged, physical, and committed defender, his main traits were his leadership, aerial prowess, and his ability to read the game and time his tackles. While initially he was not known to be the most gifted player on the ball from a technical standpoint, he developed this aspect of his game under Wenger, and he later excelled as a ball-playing centre-back, in which he became known for his ability to carry the ball out from the back, as well as his penchant for undertaking individual runs.<ref name="testimonial" /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/john-terry-captained-chelsea-for-the-500th-time-on-saturday-but-is-he-the-best-centre-back-of-the-9806372.html |title=John Terry captained Chelsea for the 500th time on Saturday - is he the best centre-back in the Premier League era? |work=The Independent |last1=Sheen |first1=Tom |date=20 October 2014 |access-date=27 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name="blindspot">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/jan/19/nemanja-vidic-footballer-of-year|title=Judges have a blindspot when destroyers like Vidic play a blinder|work=The Guardian|author1=Rob Bagchi|date=19 January 2011|access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arsenal.com/history/gunners-greatest-players-no-3.-tony-adams |title=Greatest 50 Players - 3.

==Managerial and coaching career==
[[File:Arif Isayev komanda.jpg|thumb|Adams (centre) with the Gabala senior team in 2010]]After starting a [[sports science]] degree at [[Brunel University]], Adams became the manager of [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] on 5 November 2003. He took over the team that were in last place in the [[Football League Second Division]] (third tier).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ingle |first1=Sean |title=Excited Adams takes over at Wycombe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/nov/05/newsstory.sport5 |access-date=12 October 2022 |work=The Guardian |date=5 November 2003}}</ref> On his debut three days later, he won 4–1 at home to [[Swindon Town]] in the first round of the FA Cup.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wycombe 4, Swindon 1 |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wycombe-4-swindon-1-1668367 |access-date=12 October 2022 |work=Chronicle Live |date=9 November 2009}}</ref> After a 2–1 loss at [[Tranmere Rovers]] on 12 April 2004 left the Chairboys 12 points inside the relegation zone with four games remaining, Adams said that his team would carry on fighting; unbeknown to the club, they were already relegated as two teams above them still had to play each other.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Harrison |first1=Lindsay |title=Relegation belatedly sinks in at Wycombe |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/relegation-belatedly-sinks-in-at-wycombe-56061.html |access-date=12 October 2022 |work=The Independent |date=15 April 2004}}</ref>

Wycombe began 2004–05 in the fourth tier, renamed [[Football League Two|League Two]]. Although the club were top of the table in August 2004, a loss of form saw them fall down the table.

Adams joined [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] as assistant manager to [[Harry Redknapp]] in June 2006, a position left vacant by the departure of [[Kevin Bond (English footballer)|Kevin Bond]].
