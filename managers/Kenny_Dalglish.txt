Dalglish won the [[Ballon d'Or]] Silver Award in 1983, the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] in 1983, and the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] in 1979 and 1983. In 2009, ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' magazine named Dalglish the greatest [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] in post-war British football, and he has been inducted into both the [[Scotland Football Hall of Fame|Scottish]] and [[English Football Hall of Fame|English Football Halls of Fame]]. He is highly regarded by Liverpool fans, who still affectionately refer to him as "'''King Kenny'''", and in 2006 voted him top of the fans' poll "[[100 Players Who Shook the Kop]]".

Dalglish began his career with Celtic in 1971, going on to win four [[list of Scottish football champions|Scottish league championships]], four [[Scottish Cup]]s and one [[Scottish League Cup]] with the club. In 1977, Liverpool manager [[Bob Paisley]] paid a British transfer record of £440,000 to take Dalglish to Liverpool. His years at Liverpool were among the club's most successful periods, as he won six [[list of English football champions|English league championships]], the [[FA Cup]], four [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]s, five [[FA Charity Shield]]s, three [[European Cup]]s and one [[European Super Cup]]. In international football, Dalglish made 102 appearances and scored 30 goals for Scotland between 1971 and 1986, becoming their most [[Cap (sport)|capped]] player and joint-leading goal scorer (with [[Denis Law]]). He was chosen for Scotland's [[FIFA World Cup]] squads in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]], [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]], [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], playing in all of those tournaments except the last, due to injury.

Dalglish became [[player-manager]] of Liverpool in 1985 after the resignation of [[Joe Fagan]], winning a further three First Divisions, two FA Cups and four FA Charity Shields, before resigning in 1991. Eight months later, Dalglish made a return to football management with [[Blackburn Rovers F.C|Blackburn Rovers]], whom he led from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] to win the [[Premier League]] in 1995. Soon afterwards, he stepped down as manager to become [[director of football]] at the club, before leaving altogether in 1996. In January 1997, Dalglish took over as manager at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. Newcastle finished as runners-up in the Premier League during his first season, but they only finished 13th in [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]], which led to his dismissal the following season. Dalglish went on to be appointed director of football at Celtic in 1999, and later briefly manager. He won the Scottish League Cup in 2000 before his departure from the club that year.

Between 2000 and 2010, Dalglish focused on charitable concerns, founding The Marina Dalglish Appeal with his wife to raise money for cancer care. In January 2011, Dalglish returned to Liverpool for a spell as [[caretaker manager]] after the dismissal of [[Roy Hodgson]], becoming the permanent manager in May 2011. Despite winning the [[2012 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]], which was the club's first trophy since 2006, earning them a place in the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]], and reaching the [[2012 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]], Liverpool only finished 8th in the Premier League, and Dalglish was dismissed in May 2012. In October 2013, Dalglish returned to Liverpool as a non-executive director, and [[Anfield]]'s Centenary Stand was renamed after him in October 2018.

==Managerial career==
===Liverpool===
After the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] in 1985 and [[Joe Fagan]]'s subsequent resignation as manager, Dalglish became [[Player-coach#Player-manager|player-manager]] of Liverpool. In his first season in charge in [[1985–86 in English football|1985–86]], he guided the club to its first "[[Double (association football)|double]]". Liverpool achieved this by winning the League Championship by two points over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] (Dalglish himself scored the winner in a 1–0 victory over [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] to secure the title on the final day of the season),<ref name="Mirror_86"/> and the FA Cup by beating Everton [[1986 FA Cup Final|in the final]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bevan |first1=Chris |last2=Barder |first2=Russell |date=23 January 2009 |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/7827167.stm |title=When Dalglish did the Double |work=BBC Sport |access-date=18 June 2009 |archive-date=26 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126030818/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7827167.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[1986–87 in English football|1986–87 season]] was trophyless for Liverpool. They lost 2–1 to Arsenal in the [[1987 Football League Cup final|League Cup final]] at Wembley. Before the [[1987–88 in English football|1987–88 season]], Dalglish signed two new players: striker [[Peter Beardsley]] from Newcastle and winger [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]] from [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. He had already purchased goalscorer [[John Aldridge]] from [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] (a replacement for Ian Rush, who was moving to Italy) in the spring of 1987 and early into the new campaign, bought [[Oxford United]] midfielder [[Ray Houghton]]. The new-look Liverpool side shaped by Dalglish topped the league for almost the entire season, and had a run of 37 matches unbeaten in all competitions (including 29 in the league; 22 wins and 7 draws) from the beginning of the season to 21 February 1988, when they lost to Everton in the league. Liverpool were crowned champions with four games left to play, having suffered just two defeats from 40 games. However, Dalglish's side lost the [[1988 FA Cup Final]] to underdogs [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]].<ref>[http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1988.htm FA Cup Final 1988] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209030528/http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1988.htm |date= 9 December 2011 }} FA-Cup Finals. Retrieved 18 June 2009</ref>

In the summer of 1988, Dalglish re-signed Ian Rush. Liverpool beat Everton 3–2 after extra time in the second all-Merseyside FA Cup final in [[1989 FA Cup Final|1989]], but was deprived of a second double in the [[Liverpool 0–2 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|final game of the season]], when Arsenal secured a [[last-minute goal]] to take the title from Liverpool. 

In the [[1989–90 in English football|1989–90]] season Liverpool won their third league title under Dalglish. They missed out on the double and a third successive FA Cup final appearance when they lost 4–3 in extra-time to Crystal Palace in an [[1989–90 FA Cup|FA Cup semi-final]] at [[Villa Park]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/fa-cup/5172107/Top-10-classic-FA-Cup-semi-finals.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/fa-cup/5172107/Top-10-classic-FA-Cup-semi-finals.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Top 10 classic FA Cup semi-finals |first=Rory |last=Smith |date=17 April 2009 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}{{cbignore}}</ref> At the end of the season Dalglish received his third Manager of the Year award. 

Midway in the [[1990–91 in English football|1990–91]] season, Dalglish resigned as manager of Liverpool on 22 February 1991, two days after a 4–4 draw with rivals Everton in an [[1990–91 FA Cup|FA Cup fifth round]] tie at [[Goodison Park]],<ref name="Echo_4-4">{{cite news |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-fc/liverpool-fc-news/2011/01/14/remembering-4-4-draw-between-everton-fc-and-liverpool-fc-100252-27984150/ |date=14 January 2011 |title=Remembering 4–4 draw between Everton FC and Liverpool FC |author=Birchall, Jon |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |access-date=14 October 2011}}</ref> in which Liverpool surrendered the lead four times. Daglish's resignation shocked the football community. Explaining his choice in a press conference, he said "I've been in the front line for 20 years, and it's just really a result of 20 years' active involvement in football at a very high and successful level, and Kenny Dalglish is a person that has pushed himself to the limit. It's a decision that many people will find difficult to understand, a decision that only I could have made. And it would have been wrong to mislead people that everything was fine with me." [[Johan Cruyff]], echoing Dalglish, has noted "There is a time when you have been under pressure for 15 years when the stress begins to tell." Dalglish had been under immense stress, brought upon by the Heysel and Hillsborough disasters. At the time of Dalglish's departure, the club were three points ahead in the league and still in contention for the FA Cup. Seeing out the remainder of the season under [[Graeme Souness]], Liverpool would be knocked out 1-0 by Everton in a FA Cup second replay and finish second in the league to Arsenal.<ref>{{cite web |title=The day from which Liverpool have never recovered |url=http://en.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/67343.html |publisher=ESPN |access-date=9 February 2018 |archive-date=10 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210180247/http://en.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/67343.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/14/kenny-dalglish-liverpool-everton-4-4 |title=The game that forced Kenny Dalglish to resign as Liverpool manager |date=14 January 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=14 January 2011 |first=Louise |last=Taylor |archive-date=1 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180901044431/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/14/kenny-dalglish-liverpool-everton-4-4 |url-status=live }}</ref>
