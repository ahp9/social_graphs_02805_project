'''Martin Hugh Michael O'Neill''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (born 1 March 1952) is a Northern Irish professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Association football|player]] who played as a [[midfielder]]. He is currently interim manager of [[Scottish Premiership]] side [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. 

After a brief early career in the [[Northern Ireland Football League|Irish League]], O'Neill moved to England where he spent most of his playing career with [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. He won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title in [[1977–78 Football League|1977–78]] and the [[European Cup]] twice, in [[1979 European Cup final|1979]] and [[1980 European Cup final|1980]]. He was [[cap (sport)|cap]]ped 64 times for the [[Northern Ireland national football team]], also [[Captain (association football)|captain]]ing the side at the [[1982 World Cup]].

At club level, O'Neill has managed [[Grantham Town F.C.|Grantham Town]], [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. He guided Leicester City to the [[Football League Cup]] final three times, winning twice. As Celtic manager between 2000 and 2005, he led the club to seven trophies including three [[Scottish Premier League]] titles, and reached the [[2003 UEFA Cup Final]]. After joining [[Aston Villa]] he achieved three consecutive sixth-place finishes in the English [[Premier League]] and guided them to the [[2010 Football League Cup Final]].

He became [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] manager in 2013 and led them to qualification for the [[2016 UEFA European Championship]]. He left the role by mutual agreement in November 2018. He was appointed as Nottingham Forest manager in January 2019 but was sacked in June of the same year. In October 2025, he returned to Celtic as interim manager following [[Brendan Rodgers|Brendan Rodgers']] resignation.

==Early life and Gaelic football career==
O'Neill was born in [[Kilrea]],<ref name="rté interview">Said by O'Neill during lecture on theme of "[http://www.thescore.ie/martin-oneill-irish-identity-1089500-Nov2013/ What it means to be Irish] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114244/http://www.thescore.ie/martin-oneill-irish-identity-1089500-Nov2013/ |date=26 August 2014 }}", part of the [http://www.rte.ie/radio1/presidential/ Ireland Of Tomorrow – A Presidential Lecture Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118030838/http://www.rte.ie/radio1/presidential/ |date=18 January 2009 }} (first broadcast on RTÉ Radio on 31 December 2008)</ref> [[County Londonderry]], Northern Ireland, in 1952. He was the sixth child of nine siblings, and has four brothers and four sisters.<ref name="rté interview" /> O'Neill's father was a founding member of local [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] club [[Kilrea GAC|Pádraig Pearse's Kilrea]]. His brothers Gerry and Leo played for the club as well as being on the [[Derry county football team|Derry senior team]] which won the 1958 [[Ulster Senior Football Championship|Ulster Championship]] and reached [[1958 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final|that year's final]] of the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland SFC]]. He played for both Kilrea and Derry at underage level as well. He also played Gaelic football while boarding at [[St Columb's College]], Derry,<ref name="rté interview"/> and later at [[St Malachy's College]], [[Belfast]].<ref name="rté interview"/>

While at St Malachy's, he first came to public attention as a football player with local side [[Rosario Youth Club F.C.|Rosario]] and then eventually with [[Lisburn Distillery F.C.|Distillery]]. This breached the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] prohibition on Gaelic footballers playing "foreign sports". When St Malachy's reached the 1970 [[MacRory Cup]] final, the [[Antrim GAA|Antrim GAA County Board]] refused to allow the game to go ahead at Belfast's [[Casement Park]].<ref name="rté interview"/> The colleges involved switched the venue to [[County Tyrone]] to enable him to play. St Malachy's won the game.<ref name="rté interview"/>

==Club career==
===Early career===
Before playing for [[Lisburn Distillery F.C.|Distillery]] in the [[IFA Premiership|Irish League]], O'Neill played for the South Belfast side [[Rosario Youth Club F.C.|Rosario]]. (Now he also has a conference room dedicated to him in Rosario Football Club's local Youth Club.) While at Distillery, he won the [[Irish Cup]] in 1971, scoring twice in a 3–0 win over [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] in the final.<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Ireland – Cup Finals|url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablesn/nilcuphist.html|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|work=RSSSF.com|access-date=6 September 2014}}</ref> His second goal was particularly impressive, a mazy run in which he dribbled past three opponents before scoring with a powerful shot.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Montgomery|first1=Alex|via=Google Books|title=Martin O'Neill – The Biography|date=2007|publisher=Virgin Books|isbn=978-0-7535-1241-8|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7R5zEA1JLYC&q=martin+o%27neill+law+university+of+belfast&pg=PA99|access-date=6 September 2014}}</ref> As a result of winning the cup, Distillery qualified for Europe the following season.

===Nottingham Forest===
{{Expand section|date=September 2018}}
O'Neill went on to play an integral role in Forest's golden era. He scored on his league debut for the club, a 4–1 win over [[West Bromwich Albion]] on 13 November 1971.<ref name="shnf">{{cite web|title=Martin O'Neill – Nottingham Forest|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/martin-o-neill-8740/league-appearances-for-forest_a17181/|work=Sporting Heroes|access-date=7 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907143323/http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/martin-o-neill-8740/league-appearances-for-forest_a17181/|archive-date=7 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He went on to make a total of 17 league appearances that season, scoring twice, but could not prevent his side's relegation from the First Division in 1972.<ref name="shnf" /> However, the appointment of [[Brian Clough]] as manager in January 1975 was the beginning of a revolution for Nottingham Forest.<ref>{{cite web|title=Martin O'Neill hopes glory days can return at Nottingham Forest|url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/Martin-O-Neill-hopes-glory-days-return-Nottingham/story-20024875-detail/story.html|publisher=Local World|work=Nottingham Post|access-date=6 September 2014|date=2 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906223950/http://www.nottinghampost.com/Martin-O-Neill-hopes-glory-days-return-Nottingham/story-20024875-detail/story.html|archive-date=6 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Under Clough's management, O'Neill helped Forest gain promotion to the top flight in 1977 and win the [[Football League First Division|league title]] and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] a year later,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spencer|first1=Pete|title=Reliving The Classics: When Nottingham Forest Won The League In 1977–78|url=http://www.soccersouls.com/2014/07/06/reliving-the-classics-when-nottingham-forest-won-the-league-in-1977-78/|publisher=FFO Sports Publishing|work=Soccer Souls|access-date=6 September 2014|date=6 July 2014}}</ref> which was followed by further League Cup success in 1979.<ref name="mont">{{cite web|title=Martin O'Neill timeline|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/aug/09/martin-oneill-timeline-aston-villa|publisher=Guardian News and Media|work=The Guardian|access-date=6 September 2014|date=9 August 2010}}</ref> That same year, he was dropped to the substitutes' bench for Forest's first [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] victory over [[Malmö FF|Malmö]] after failing to fully recover from an injury,<ref>{{cite web|title=Season 1978–79|url=http://www.europeancuphistory.com/euro79.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926230641/http://www.europeancuphistory.com/euro79.html|url-status=usurped|archive-date=26 September 2007|publisher=European Cup History|access-date=6 September 2014}}</ref><ref name="ec79">{{cite web|title=Malmo FF v Nottingham Forest, 30 May 1979|url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/malmo-ff-v-nottingham-forest-30-may-1979-307662/|publisher=AFS Enterprises|work=11v11.com|access-date=6 September 2014}}</ref> but he played in their 1980 win over [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg]].<ref name="ec80">{{cite web|title=European Cup 1980|url=https://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/club/history-landing-page/european-cup-1980/|publisher=Nottingham Forest|access-date=28 June 2019}}</ref>

===Later career===
O'Neill signed for Norwich City in February 1981 for £250,000. However, Norwich were relegated on the last day of the season and he activated a release clause which enabled him to sign for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].<ref name=wscmay22>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[When Saturday Comes]]|date=May 2022|page=25|title=Focus on Martin O'Neill}}</ref> Despite a good start, he soon became out of favour with manager [[John Bond (footballer)|John Bond]] and returned to Norwich in February 1982, where he scored six goals to help them finish third and secure promotion.<ref name=wscmay22/> After another season at Norwich, he returned to Nottingham to play for [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] where they had successive relegations.<ref name=wscmay22/> Hoping to get fit for Northern Ireland's 1986 World Cup squad, O'Neill attempted to make a comeback in 1984 with [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]], but only played part of a reserve game before being forced off with a knee injury after 20 minutes. After leaving Chesterfield, [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] manager [[Ray Harford]] invited O'Neill to join the club in a bid to regain his fitness. O'Neill only managed to take part in two reserve games for Fulham (neither of which he completed), before retiring as a result of his [[cruciate ligament]] injury in February 1985.<ref name="shmc">{{cite web|title=Martin O'Neill – Manchester City|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/manchester-city-fc/martin-o-neill-8740/biography-of-his-football-career-at-man-city_a12031/|work=Sporting Heroes|access-date=7 September 2014}}</ref><ref name="spm">{{cite web|title=In Profile: Martin O'Neill|date=3 December 2011 |url=http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-city/news/in-profile-martin-oneill_9361.html|publisher=SportsMole|access-date=7 September 2014}}</ref>

==International career==
O'Neill first represented his country in an amateur international against Scotland at [[The Oval]] in February 1971.

==Managerial career==
After his playing career, O'Neill worked at an insurance company<ref name=wscmay22/> before beginning a career in football management, initially at [[Grantham Town F.C.|Grantham Town]] in 1987. This was followed by a brief spell at the helm of [[Shepshed Charterhouse]].<ref name="shmc" />

===Wycombe Wanderers===
He became manager of [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in February 1990. In May of that year, he played in the Martin O'Neill XI side, along with [[George Best]], in a friendly match that was to be the last ever match held at [[Loakes Park]]. In the 1990–91 season, he took Wycombe to fifth in the [[Football Conference]]. In the 1991–92 season, he led Wycombe to second place in the Conference, losing out to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] only on goal difference. The [[1992–93 in English football#Successful managers|following season]], he took Wycombe into the Football League for the very first time. In the [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94 season]], he guided Wycombe to a second successive promotion via the Division 3 play-offs as a 4–2 win over [[Preston North End]] took them up into Division 2.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fchd.info/WYCOMBEW.HTM |title=Wycombe Wanderers |publisher=Richard Rundle |work=Football Club History Database |access-date=9 August 2010}}</ref> In the 1994–95 season, Wycombe narrowly missed out on the Division 2 play-offs and he left the club on 13 June 1995 to become manager at Norwich City.

On 25 May 2005, Celtic announced that O'Neill would resign as manager to care for his wife, Geraldine, who had [[lymphoma]]. His last competitive game in charge of Celtic was the Scottish Cup final 1–0 victory over [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] on 28 May 2005, decided by an eleventh-minute goal by [[Alan Thompson (footballer, born 1973)|Alan Thompson]].<ref>{{cite news |title=O'Neill leaves Bhoys with Cup win |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_div_1/4589807.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 May 2005 |access-date=23 April 2012}}</ref>

Under O'Neill, Celtic won 213, drew 29 and lost 40 of 282 games played, making him the most successful Celtic manager since Jock Stein. In his five seasons at Celtic Park, O'Neill won three Scottish Premier League titles, three Scottish Cups, and a League Cup. The two league titles he lost were by margins of a goal and a point, respectively. He also oversaw a record seven consecutive victories in Old Firm derbies, and in the 2003–04 season Celtic created a British record of 25 consecutive league victories.<ref name=25inarow>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/mar/11/manchester-united-consecutive-league-wins-the-knowledge|title=Have Manchester United just set a record for consecutive league wins?|publisher=Guardian News and Media|work=The Guardian|date=11 March 2009|access-date=14 January 2011|first1=Rob|last1=Smyth|first2=John|last2=Ashdown}}</ref> His win rate of 75.5% is the highest of any manager in the club's history.<ref>{{cite news |title=Celtic Manager Records |url=https://www.fitbastats.com/celtic/manager_records.php |publisher=fitba stats |access-date=31 January 2021}}</ref>

===Aston Villa===
[[File:Martin O'Neill Aston Villa vs FH.jpg|thumb|O'Neill in charge of Aston Villa]]
O'Neill was introduced as the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] manager at a press conference on 4 August 2006. At this, he stated: "It's absolutely fantastic to be back and with a club such as this. This is a fantastic challenge. I am well aware of the history of this football club. Trying to restore it to its days of former glory seems a long way away – but why not try? It is nearly 25&nbsp;years since they won the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] but that is the dream."<ref name=Dream>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_preview/0,19764,11065_3242664,00.html|title=Carling Cup final preview|date=28 February 2010|access-date=15 January 2011|publisher=Sky Sports }}</ref>

Villa had the year's longest unbeaten start of any [[Premier League]] side in 2006–07, going 9 games without a league defeat until 28 October. Villa suffered a mid-season slump but recovered late in the season, winning their three away games in April to end the season how it began with a run of 9 unbeaten fixtures.

Aston Villa just missed out on a UEFA Cup spot on the final day of the 2007–08 season and qualified for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]] by finishing sixth. They scored 71 goals, (their second best ever tally in the Premier League and best tally since winning the title in 1981), gained 60 points which was Villa's highest points tally since 1996–97, and were the third highest goalscorers.<ref name=Goals>{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/tables/_/league/eng.1/season/2007/barclays-premier-league?cc=5739|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024042914/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/tables/_/league/eng.1/season/2007/barclays-premier-league?cc=5739|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 October 2012|title=2007–2008 English Premier League Table|access-date=15 January 2011|publisher=soccernet.espn.go.com.com}}</ref>

After 25 games of the [[2008–09 Aston Villa season|2008–09 season]], having qualified for the UEFA Cup as joint winners of the Intertoto Cup, the club were third in the table on 51 points, two points above Chelsea on level games and seven points above Arsenal in fifth place and on course for a place in the Champions League for the first time since 1983. O'Neill decided to prioritise Champions League qualification above all else, fielding a virtual reserve side for a UEFA Cup game against CSKA Moscow which was subsequently lost.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SPORT/football/02/26/uefacup.roundup/index.html|title=Villa 'reserves' crash out to CSKA Moscow|publisher=CNN|date=26 February 2009|access-date=14 December 2013}}</ref> Following this, Villa failed to win any of the next 8 league games and improving form for Arsenal & Chelsea meant that Villa failed to reach the top 4.

At the start of the 2009–10 season, Villa failed to qualify for the group stage of the newly named [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]], but continued their progress in the league with wins against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].<ref name=Arse/> Arsenal defeated Villa 3–0 at Emirates Stadium, and drew at home.<ref name=Arse>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8423583.stm|title=Arsenal 3 – 0 Aston Villa|date=27 December 2009|access-date=15 January 2011|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

Once again Villa finished sixth for the third season running, and once again improved their points tally finishing with 64 points; their poor home form (they drew eight times at home) denied them a chance to qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League]].

Aston Villa reached their first final under O'Neill, and their first final in ten years on 28 February 2010 against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], but lost 2–1.<ref name=Carling>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/7338947/Aston-Villa-1-Manchester-United-2-Carling-Cup-final-match-report.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/7338947/Aston-Villa-1-Manchester-United-2-Carling-Cup-final-match-report.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Aston Villa 1 Manchester United 2: Carling Cup final match report|date=1 March 2010|access-date=15 January 2011|publisher=www.telegraph.co.uk|location=London|first=Henry|last=Winter}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===Sunderland===
[[File:Martin O'Neill (cropped).jpg|120px|thumb|O'Neill with Sunderland in 2012]]
On 3 December 2011, O'Neill signed a three-year contract with the [[Premier League]] club [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], the team he had supported as a boy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.safc.com/news/20111203/sunderland-appoint-martin-oneill_2256213_2536081|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713001004/http://www.safc.com/news/20111203/sunderland-appoint-martin-oneill_2256213_2536081|archive-date=13 July 2012|title= Sunderland appoint Martin O'Neill|publisher=Sunderland A.F.C.|date=3 December 2011|access-date=3 December 2011}}</ref> In O'Neill's first game in charge, Sunderland came from 1–0 down to beat [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] 2–1 at the [[Stadium of Light]]. Under O'Neill, Sunderland began to improve dramatically with four wins from his first six games, including one over league leaders [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].<ref>{{cite news

Sunderland's form declined towards the end of the season and they finished in 13th place.

The following season, O'Neill had bought [[Steven Fletcher (footballer)|Steven Fletcher]] and [[Adam Johnson (footballer)|Adam Johnson]] in an attempt to build on his previous 13th place and push on for the top ten. He claimed a solid 0–0 draw at the [[Emirates Stadium|Emirates]] against [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] in the first game of the season. Sunderland went unbeaten for the first five games before a 3–0 defeat at [[Manchester City FC|Manchester City]]. They then claimed a 1–1 draw in O'Neill's first [[Tyne-Wear derby]] at the [[Stadium of Light]] after a late [[Demba Ba]] own goal. Sunderland then suffered a 0–1 home defeat to [[Aston Villa]] and a 1–0 defeat to [[Middlesbrough FC|Middlesbrough]] in the League Cup. Sunderland slipped into the relegation zone following a 1–3 home defeat to [[Chelsea FC|Chelsea]]. Sunderland's form started to improve over the winter as they climbed the table following an impressive run of results, including another 1–0 success over [[Manchester City FC|Manchester City]] and a 2–3 success over [[Wigan Athletic|Wigan]] as they reached a season high of eleventh. However, this proved to be O'Neill's last victory, as Sunderland endured a run of eight games without a win.

O'Neill was dismissed by Sunderland on 30 March 2013 following a 1–0 defeat by Manchester United, which left the team one point above the Premier League relegation zone with seven games left to play in the season. Sunderland had failed to secure victory in the eight matches leading up to O'Neill's departure, winning only three points out of a possible 24 during that spell.<ref>{{cite news

In March 2016, O'Neill made comments made about the physical appearance of players' female partners, which were criticised as sexist. Orla O'Connor of the National Women's Council of Ireland said: "There is no place for sexist comments of this nature in Irish football, particularly at this level".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/republic-of-ireland/martin-oneill-in-sexism-storm-after-quip-only-pretty-wags-welcome-at-euros-34571018.html|title=Martin O'Neill in sexism storm after quip only pretty WAGs welcome at Euros|work=Belfast Telegraph|access-date=13 June 2016}}</ref>
