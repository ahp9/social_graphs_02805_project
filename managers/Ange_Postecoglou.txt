Born in Greece, Postecoglou grew up in [[Melbourne]] from the age of five. As a player, he spent most of his club career as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne Hellas]] and played four games for the [[Australia men's national soccer team|Australia national team]] in the late 1980s. He began managing at South Melbourne Hellas in 1996, winning the [[National Soccer League]] twice and the [[OFC Men's Champions League|OFC Champions League]] in 1999. He then led the national [[Australia national under-17 soccer team|under-17]] and [[Australia national under-20 soccer team|under-20]] teams.

Known for his [[Association football tactics and skills#Attcking tactics|heavily attacking style of play]], dubbed "[[Angeball]]", Postecoglou managed [[Brisbane Roar]] and [[Melbourne Victory]] in the [[A-League]], winning the Premiership in 2011 and the Championship in 2011 and 2012 with Brisbane Roar. He was the men's senior national team manager from 2013 to 2017, winning the [[AFC Asian Cup]] in [[2015 AFC Asian Cup|2015]] and also going to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. He won the [[J1 League]] with [[Yokohama F. Marinos]] in [[2019 J1 League|2019]], and then won five trophies (including two [[list of Scottish football champions|league titles]]) in two seasons with Scottish side [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. He became head coach of Premier League club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C|Tottenham Hotspur]] in 2023, where he won the [[UEFA Europa League]] in [[2025 UEFA Europa League final|2025]], marking the club's first trophy since 2008 and its first European trophy since 1984, before being dismissed as the triumph came amid a historically poor domestic performance [[2024–25 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|that season]]. In September 2025, Postecoglou was appointed manager of [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], but was sacked after 39 days having failed to win any of his eight matches in charge.

As a player, he was involved in their [[1984 National Soccer League|1984]] and [[1990–91 National Soccer League|1990–91]] titles, the latter as captain in a penalty shootout win over rivals [[Melbourne Knights FC|Melbourne Croatia]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Schwab |first=Laurie |date=6 May 1991 |title=Hellas' last-gasp title |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-age-hellas-last-gasp-title/83723622/ |access-date=23 May 2025 |work=The Age |pages=30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ange Postecoglou |url=http://www.socceroos.com.au/player/ange-postecoglou/98e338kx41xb1k6olzsi19on4 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326005433/http://www.socceroos.com.au/player/ange-postecoglou/98e338kx41xb1k6olzsi19on4 |archive-date=26 March 2017 |access-date=25 March 2017 |website=Socceroos |publisher=Football Federation Australia}}</ref> He was coached by Hungarian [[Ferenc Puskás]], a renowned player whom his father had told him about as a child.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kilpatrick |first=Dan |date=5 April 2024 |title=How icon Ferenc Puskas shaped Ange Postecoglou's coaching philosophy |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-ange-postecoglou-ferenc-puskas-b1149588.html |access-date=2 June 2025 |website=The Standard |language=en}}</ref> According to Postecoglou, Puskás played a [[4-3-3 formation|4–3–3 formation]] rigid full-backs and attacking wingers.

He took charge of South Melbourne's final three matches of the [[1995–96 National Soccer League]] season before being made permanent coach in June 1996.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Schwab |first=Laurie |date=8 June 1996 |title=South appoints Postecoglou, lists Socceroos |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-age-south-appoints-postecoglou-list/172887614/ |access-date=22 May 2025 |work=The Age |pages=55}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Schwab |first=Laurie |date=28 April 1996 |title=Angie, is it time South said goodbye? |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-age-angie-is-it-time-south-said-goo/172887557/ |access-date=22 May 2025 |work=The Age |pages=54}}</ref>

Postecoglou led South to consecutive National Soccer League titles in 1997–98 (ending a seven-year drought) and 1998–99, as well as winning the [[1999 Oceania Club Championship]], which in turn led to South's participation in the [[2000 FIFA Club World Championship]].<ref name="smfc1">{{Cite web |title=Team of the Century Defender Nominees |url=http://www.smfc.com.au/history/team-of-the-century/hall-of-champions/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004235425/http://www.smfc.com.au/history/team-of-the-century/hall-of-champions/ |archive-date=4 October 2009 |access-date=16 October 2009 |publisher=South Melbourne Football Club}}</ref>
