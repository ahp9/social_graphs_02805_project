'''Graham Cyril Rix''' (born 23 October 1957) is an English former professional [[association football|football]] player who later became a coach and manager.

Rix played for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for thirteen years, then [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] (on loan), [[SM Caen|Caen]], [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]], [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. He also won 17 caps for [[England national football team|England]] between 1980 and 1984. Rix then managed [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] (as caretaker), [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.| Heart of Midlothian]], [[Central F.C.|Central]], [[A.F.C. Portchester|AFC Portchester]] and [[Fareham Town F.C.|Fareham Town]].

==Club career==

===Arsenal===
Originally from [[Doncaster]], Yorkshire, Rix joined [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] as an apprentice in 1974 and turned professional the year after. He made his debut for the club against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on 2 April 1977, and marked it by scoring the opening goal. Rix immediately became a regular on the [[Winger (sport)|left wing]], replacing [[George Armstrong (footballer)|George Armstrong]]. Together with [[Liam Brady]], he formed part of an impressive attacking midfield, which helped Arsenal to three successive [[FA Cup]] finals between 1978 and 1980. Arsenal only won one of these, in [[1979 FA Cup final|1979]] against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]; the final score was 3–2, with Rix crossing for [[Alan Sunderland]]'s last-minute winner, just one minute after United had equalised to level the score 2–2.<ref name=AFC>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/features/20160113/graham-rix|title=Graham Rix: Feature|website=Arsenal.com}}</ref><ref name=Arsenal>{{cite web|url=https://www.arsenal.com/historic/players/graham-rix|title=Graham Rix|website=Arsenal.com}}</ref>

Arsenal reached the [[1980 European Cup Winners' Cup final|European Cup Winners' Cup final the following season]], against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]; the match finished 0–0 after [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]] – a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] ensued, but Rix missed his penalty and Arsenal lost. He became captain of the club in 1983. Arsenal's form slumped in the early 1980s, though, meaning Rix was unable to claim any silverware as skipper. Arsenal won the [[1986–87 Football League Cup|1986–87 League Cup]]; Rix was not part of the squad for the [[1987 Football League Cup final|final]] against Liverpool but he contributed three appearances en route.<ref>{{cite news |title=Arsenal Stats |url=http://thearsenalhistory.com/stat/aftlu.htm |website=thearsenalhistory.com |access-date=13 October 2017 |archive-date=15 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715102949/http://thearsenalhistory.com/stat/aftlu.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=AFC /><ref name=Arsenal />

A series of injuries to his [[achilles tendon]] kept Rix out of the team in the mid-1980s, and he lost his starting place in the side to [[Martin Hayes (footballer)|Martin Hayes]]. Rix had a spell on loan at [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]], before being released in 1988. In all, he played 464 times for the Gunners, scoring 51 goals.<ref name=Caen /><ref name=AFC /><ref name=Arsenal />

===After Arsenal===
After leaving the London club, Rix was the subject of offers from [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] as well as [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], but he instead signed for French club [[SM Caen|Caen]], where he would spend three years before transferring to [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]], and then played in [[Football in Scotland|Scotland]] for [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] before announcing his retirement as a player in 1993.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/my-own-goal--graham-rix-1574913.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=My own goal – Graham Rix | date=26 February 1995}}</ref><ref name=Caen>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11801/8904829/brits-abroad-graham-rix|title=Brits abroad - Graham Rix|website=Sky Sports.com}}</ref>

==International career==
Between 1980 and 1984, Rix played for the [[England national football team|England national team]], including making five appearances at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]]. He was capped 17 times, but failed to score. His first appearance came on 10 September 1980 in a 4–0 win over [[Norway national football team|Norway]], his last in a 1–0 win over [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] on 4 April 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfc.com/Profiles/php/PlayerProfileByName.php?id=812|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819205643/http://www.englandfc.com/Profiles/php/PlayerProfileByName.php?id=812|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 August 2012|title=Graham Rix: England Profile|website=England FC.com}}</ref>

==Coaching career==
===Chelsea===
Rix joined [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] as youth team coach in mid-1993. During an injury crisis, he briefly enlisted as a player for the club, playing a solitary [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] match in May 1995 against his former club Arsenal. Rix became assistant manager in 1996 under new Blues boss [[Ruud Gullit]], and continued in the same role under Gullit's successor [[Gianluca Vialli]], winning the FA Cup in 1997, and the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and Cup Winners' Cup in 1998. He won the FA Cup again in 2000, before leaving the club, after a brief spell as caretaker manager following Vialli's sacking by [[Ken Bates]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://talksport.com/radio/richard-keys-and-andy-gray/blog/2012-01-31/graham-rix-his-career-chelsea-arsenal-and-england|title=Graham Rix on his career with Chelsea, Arsenal and England|website=Talksport.com|date=31 January 2012 }}</ref>

===Portsmouth and Oxford===
Rix managed [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] between 2001 and 2002, where his enthusiastic style of management started well, but tapered off in the middle of the [[2001–02 Portsmouth F.C. season|2001–02 season]]. A string of poor results, including a 4–1 home loss in the [[FA Cup]] to bottom of the Football League [[Leyton Orient]],<ref>{{cite news

|title=Orient crush Pompey
|work=BBC News
|date=5 January 2002 |access-date=1 May 2020}}</ref> meant that [[Director of Football]] [[Harry Redknapp]] was given more responsibilities until he eventually replaced Rix as team manager toward the end of the season. Rix then managed [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] for seven months in 2004. Their form declined sharply during the last three months of the [[2003-04 in English football|2003–04]] Division Three campaign: they fell from the automatic promotion places to ninth in the final table, failing to achieve a playoff place. He was dismissed after their poor form continued into the [[2004-05 in English football|2004–05]] season.{{cn|date=March 2025}}

===Hearts===
In November 2005, after speculation linking him with the manager's job at [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]], it was confirmed that Rix would take over at Tynecastle. He officially took the position of head coach on 8 November 2005.<ref>{{cite web | title = Mercer slams 'hypocrites' over Rix appointment | work = Scotsman | url = http://sport.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=24&id=2217222005 | date = 9 November 2005 | access-date = 5 October 2007 }}</ref> Events reported in February 2006, by Scottish newspapers, suggested that Rix was unhappy with [[Vladimir Romanov]]'s "hands on" approach and speculation increased that Romanov was involved in team selection. On 22 March 2006 Rix was sacked as manager after just four months in charge, with the club citing poor results as the reason.<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/4832716.stm "Rix sacked as Hearts head coach"] , ''BBC News'', 23 March 2006</ref>

{{Further|Racism in association football#United Kingdom}}
In 2018, Rix, along with assistant manager [[Gwyn Williams (football manager)|Gwyn Williams]], was accused of racism and physical assault by several Chelsea trainees who were of school age at the time. It was alleged that Rix had thrown a cup of hot coffee in the face of one player. Both denied the allegations. After a seven-month investigation, the police decided there was insufficient evidence to take any action.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/12/graham-rix-gwyn-williams-accused-racism-bullying-chelsea|title=Graham Rix and Gwyn Williams accused of racism and bullying while at Chelsea|first=Daniel|last=Taylor|date=12 January 2018|work=The Guardian}}</ref> In February 2022, Chelsea agreed to make payments to several former players who had sued the club.{{cn|date=March 2025}}
