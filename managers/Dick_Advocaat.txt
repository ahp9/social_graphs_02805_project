==Coaching career==

===1981–92: Early coaching in the Netherlands===
In addition to playing football, Advocaat was a [[physical education]] teacher and became involved in coaching in 1981 when his older brother Jaap was offered a job running amateur Saturday football side Door Samenwerking Verkregen Pijnacker (DSVP). Jaap did not take the role but recommended Dick for the job.<ref name="Herald"/><ref name="Factfile">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jan/24/newsstory.sport10 |title=Dick Advocaat factfile |date=24 January 2002 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=28 November 2009 |location=London}}</ref> Advocaat coached this side during the final four years of his playing career with Sparta Rotterdam and Utrecht.<ref name="ABC">{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/soccer/euro/2004/profiles/advocaat.htm |title=Advocaat answers his critics with play-off success |publisher=[[ABC Online]] |access-date=29 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110133210/http://www.abc.net.au/soccer/euro/2004/profiles/advocaat.htm |archive-date=10 November 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1984, Advocaat was unexpectedly appointed as assistant to [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]] head coach [[Rinus Michels]]. Advocaat became a protégé of Michels, whose sobriquet was "The General". In reference to this, Advocaat acquired the nickname "The Little General".<ref name="Herald"/><ref name="Factfile"/> In 1987, Advocaat became manager of his first professional club, [[HFC Haarlem]], which he led for two years.

===1992–98: Dutch national team and PSV Eindhoven===
In 1990, Advocaat once more became an assistant to Michels, who was having his fourth spell as coach of the Dutch national team and looking to [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 6|qualify]] for [[UEFA Euro 1992]].<ref name="Independent"/> At Euro 1992, it became apparent it would be Michels' last job, and following the tournament, Advocaat took over as national coach.<ref name="Herald"/><ref name="ABC"/> Advocaat lost his first two matches in charge, a friendly against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and a [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 2|1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier]] against [[Norway national football team|Norway]].<ref name="ned 1992">{{cite web |title=Netherlands » Fixtures & Results 1992 |url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/niederlande-team/1992/3/ |publisher=World Football |access-date=10 July 2016}}</ref> During the qualifying campaign, Advocaat and [[Ruud Gullit]] fell out; Gullit was unhappy with Advocaat's tactics in the World Cup qualifier against [[England national football team|England]] and was eventually substituted.

Despite the result, Advocaat was scheduled to lose his job to [[Johan Cruyff]] for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]]. However, talks between Cruyff and the [[Royal Dutch Football Association]] (KNVB) broke down at the last minute and Advocaat retained his position, causing Gullit to remain in retirement although he initially joined the Dutch squad for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-05-31-sp-64033-story.html |title=Star Gullit Quits Dutch World Cup Team |last=Jones |first=Grahame |date=31 May 1994 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-872404.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102151430/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-872404.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 November 2012 |title=Some Dutch Unhappy Cruyff Out of Picture |last=Goff |first=Steven |date=24 January 1994 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=29 November 2009}}</ref> In 1993, the Dutch national team had a record of five wins and two draws.<ref name="ned 1993">{{cite web |title=Netherlands » Fixtures & Results 1993 |url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/niederlande-team/1993/3/ |publisher=World Football |access-date=10 July 2016}}</ref>
