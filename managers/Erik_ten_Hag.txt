Ajax began their [[2019–20 AFC Ajax season|2019–20 season]] with a 2–0 victory over [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] in the [[2019 Johan Cruyff Shield]]. During the 2019–20 [[2019-20 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] season, Ajax won 14 and drew two of their first 16 matches. This was followed by successive defeats to [[Willem II (football club)|Willem II]] and to AZ. Ajax's form following these defeats fluctuated, with the club going on to lose three further games in their next eight, as well as a second league defeat of the season to AZ. However, due to the emergence of the global [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the Eredivisie season was null and voided, which meant that despite Ajax being top on goal difference to AZ, there wouldn't be an official winner of the 2019–20 [[2019-20 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] season. Ajax's European campaign was relatively less successful compared to the previous season, having finished third in their group in the 2019–20 [[2019-20 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and being subsequently relegated to the UEFA Europa League. Ajax was resultantly knocked out by [[Getafe CF|Getafe]] after a 3–2 aggregate loss in the Round of 32 of the [[2019-20 UEFA Europa League|2019–20 Europa League]].

====2020–2022: Consecutive league titles====
Ajax began the 2020–21 season by winning their first three games, before a 1–0 defeat at [[FC Groningen|Groningen]], which proved to be one of the two league defeats that Ten Hag's team sustained over the course of the season. On 24 October 2020, Ten Hag led Ajax to a historic [[VVV-Venlo 0-13 AFC Ajax|13–0]] victory over [[VVV-Venlo]], breaking the Eredivisie record of the biggest recorded victory in the history of the competition. In the [[2020-21 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]], the team lost 3–2 on aggregate to [[AS Roma|Roma]] in the quarter-finals. On 18 April 2021, Ten Hag guided Ajax to their record-extending 20th KNVB Cup with a 2–1 win over [[SBV Vitesse|Vitesse]] in the [[2021 KNVB Cup Final|final]].<ref name="KNVBt">{{cite web |url=http://www.football-oranje.com/ajax-strike-late-to-down-vitesse-and-lift-their-20th-knvb-cup/ |title=Ajax strike late to down Vitesse and lift their 20th KNVB Cup |website=Football Oranje |date=18 April 2021 |accessdate=30 April 2021}}</ref> Two weeks later, Ten Hag extended his contract with Ajax through to the end of the 2022–23 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/ajax-amsterdam/story/4374156/ajax-boss-ten-hag-extends-contract-ending-links-with-tottenham |title=Ajax boss Ten Hag extends contract ending links with Tottenham |publisher=ESPN |date=30 April 2021 |accessdate=30 April 2021}}</ref>

Ajax began their 2021–22 campaign with a 4–0 defeat in the [[2021 Johan Cruyff Shield|Johan Cruyff Shield]] to PSV, before going unbeaten for the first seven [[2021–22 Eredivisie|league]] games before a 1–0 home defeat to [[FC Utrecht|Utrecht]]. This proved to be one of Ajax' three league defeats over the season, as Ajax won the title, with results including 5–0 home win over PSV on 24 October 2021. Ajax won all six of their group matches in the [[2021–22 UEFA Champions League]]. On 16 January 2022, Ten Hag became the fastest manager in league history to reach 100 wins with Ajax, achieving the feat in 128 matches, when his side beat Utrecht 3–0 away on match day 19.<ref name=":3">{{cite web |url=https://sportnieuws.nl/voetbal/binnenland/geen-enkele-eredivisie-trainer-won-ooit-zo-snel-100-keer-met-1-club-als-ten-hag-met-ajax/ |title=Geen enkele Eredivisie-trainer won ooit zo snel 100 keer met 1 club als Ten Hag met Ajax |date=16 January 2022|access-date=16 January 2022 |language=nl |website=sportnieuws.nl |publisher=DPG Media}}</ref>

====2024: Dip in performances and dismissal====
{{main|2024–25 Manchester United F.C. season}}
On 4 July 2024, Manchester United triggered a one-year extension to Ten Hag's contract to keep him with the club until 2026.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cd17d871gj9o |title=Man Utd trigger one-year extension to Ten Hag deal |website=BBC Sport |date=4 July 2024 |access-date=4 July 2024}}</ref> Former Manchester United striker [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] and [[René Hake]] joined as assistant managers as a replacement for [[Mitchell van der Gaag]], who left his role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c047djzzeezo.amp|title= Van Nistelrooy returns to Man Utd in coaching reshuffle|date= 11 July 2024}}</ref> Coach [[Steve McClaren]] also resigned from his role at United to take on the manager position for [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12010/13188392/steve-mcclaren-leaves-man-utd-to-be-appointed-new-jamaica-head-coach-on-two-year-deal|title=Steve McClaren leaves Man Utd to be appointed new Jamaica head coach on two year deal|work=Sky Sports |publisher=[[Sky Sports]]}}</ref> 

Manchester United started the 2024–25 season by playing against Manchester City in the [[2024 FA Community Shield]]. The game ended in a 1–1 draw, and United lost 7–6 on penalties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/videos/c4gqll7eevwo |title=Man City beat Man Utd on penalties to win Community Shield |publisher=BBC |date=10 August 2024 |access-date=24 August 2024}}</ref> On 6 October 2024, after failing to beat [[FC Porto|Porto]] in the Europa League and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in the Premier League in the same week, and with United 14th in the league table with eight points from seven games – the club's worst start in the league since [[1989–90 Manchester United F.C. season|1989–90]] – the BBC asked if the team's poor performances warranted Ten Hag's dismissal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cd0zydxrpl8o|title= What now for Ten Hag? Five things for Man Utd bosses to consider|date= 6 October 2024}}</ref>

On 28 October 2024, Ten Hag was dismissed from his role as head coach at Manchester United. This came after a string of poor results, having drawn away against [[Fenerbahçe S.K.|Fenerbahçe]] in the Europa League and having lost 2–1 away in the league against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], through a controversial penalty which was converted by [[Jarrod Bowen]] in added time. These results left Manchester United in 14th place in the Premier League with 11 points from nine games, and with three points from three games in the Europa League. Assistant manager Ruud van Nistelrooy succeeded Ten Hag as interim manager.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Club statement |url=https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/man-utd-official-club-statement-on-erik-ten-hag-28-oct |access-date=28 October 2024 |website=www.manutd.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last1=Ornstein |first1=David |last2=Crafton |first2=Adam |title=Erik ten Hag sacked as Manchester United manager |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5854757/2024/10/28/erik-ten-hag-sacked-manchester-united/ |access-date=28 October 2024 |work=The New York Times |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cpvznn4v01yo |title=Man Utd sack manager Ten Hag |first1=Simon |last1=Stone |first2=Sean |last2=Kearns |website=BBC Sport |date=28 October 2024 |access-date=28 October 2024}}</ref> On 1 November, Manchester United announced the appointment of [[Ruben Amorim]] as a permanent replacement, and that he would begin his tenure at the club on 11 November.<ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd appoint Ruben Amorim as new head coach |url=https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/Man-Utd-appoint-Ruben-Amorim-as-new-head-coach |website=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=1 November 2024 |access-date=10 November 2024 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Jamie |last=Jackson |title=Manchester United announce Rúben Amorim's appointment as head coach |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/01/manchester-united-confirm-ruben-amorim-manager-sporting-november |work=The Guardian |issn=0261-3077 |date=1 November 2024 |access-date=10 November 2024 }}</ref>

===Bayer Leverkusen===
On 26 May 2025, Ten Hag was appointed head coach of [[Bundesliga]] club [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], signing a contract through 2027 and starting his job at the club from 1 July, succeeding [[Xabi Alonso]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=26 May 2025 |title=Erik ten Hag is new Bayer 04 head coach |url=https://www.bayer04.de/en-us/news/bayer04/erik-ten-hag-is-new-bayer-04-head-coach |access-date=26 May 2025 |publisher=[[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Brewin |first=John |date=26 May 2025 |title=Erik ten Hag returns to management as new Bayer Leverkusen head coach |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/26/erik-ten-hag-returns-to-football-as-new-bayer-leverkusen-head-coach |access-date=26 May 2025 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Ten Hag's short tenure at the club would quickly turn ugly. A report by German outlet [[Bild|BILD]] alleged that Ten Hag employed unusual tactics such as prioritizing push-ups over running and passing while repeatedly clashing with upper management over player transfers by only suggesting players from Ten Hag's own agency, SEG. He failed to connect with anyone at the club and his actions alienated virtually the entire club and "turned all departments, bodies, and players against him". This was further evident after Leverkusen lost its home opener 2-1 against [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|Hoffenheim]] in which Ten Hag did not give a pre-match speech, much to the surprise of his players. The next game would prove to be the boiling point in which Leverkusen drew 3-3 despite initially having a 3-1 lead against [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-09-05 |title=Erik ten Hag: How Ex-Man Utd Boss Spiralled Towards Humiliating Bayer Leverkusen Sacking |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/erik-ten-hag-how-ex-man-utd-boss-spiralled-humiliating-bayer-leverkusen-sacking |access-date=2025-09-10 |website=SI |language=en-US}}</ref>

This culminated into Leverkusen sacking Ten Hag's on 1 September 2025, after two Bundesliga games and three total competitive games in charge, setting a new record for the fewest league matches in charge before being dismissed in Germany.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-09-01 |title=Bayer Leverkusen dismiss Erik Ten Hag after only three games |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/bayer-leverkusen-sack-erik-ten-hag-33817 |access-date=2025-09-01 |website=www.bundesliga.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2025-09-01|access-date=2025-09-01|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cd7y19095rno|first=Neil|last=Johnston|work=BBC Sport|title=Ten Hag sacked by Leverkusen after two league games}}</ref> [[Kasper Hjulmand]] was brought in as his replacement on 8 September.

==Personal life==
Ten Hag and his wife, Bianca, have two daughters and a son.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-utd-ten-hag-networth-33476333 |title=Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag's huge net worth, wife Bianca, and house above supermarket |first=Chris |last=Burns |newspaper=Daily Mirror |location=London |date=16 August 2024 |access-date=20 October 2024}}</ref>
