He played as a [[midfielder]] for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] and [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]. He became manager of Charlton Athletic in 1991 and held the role until 2006, becoming the second-longest-serving manager of the club.

==Playing career==

===Club career===
He began his football playing career with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], joining them as an apprentice on leaving school in the summer of 1974.<ref name="Claret and Blue Blood">{{cite book | last = Blows | first = Kirk |author2= Ben Sharratt | title = Claret and Blue Blood.

West Ham United (3-1, 2-0)|West Ham youth team]], alongside [[Alvin Martin]], [[Geoff Pike]] and [[Paul Brush]] which was beaten by Ipswich Town 5–1 on aggregate in the final of the [[FA Youth Cup]].<ref name="Claret and Blue Blood" />

Curbishley's first win with the club and first goal came in a 2–1 scoreline at home against Newcastle in October 1975, in which he had replaced an injured [[Trevor Brooking]] in the starting line-up.<ref name="Claret and Blue Blood" /> His arrival in the first team was so impressive that he was given the nickname "Whizz" by teammate [[Pat Holland]].<ref name="Claret and Blue Blood" /> He appeared in both legs of the West Ham's [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] third-round tie against Den Haag in March 1976, aged 18, although he did not play in the semi-final games against [[Eintracht Frankfurt]], nor in the final against [[R.S.C.

He joined local rivals [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 1983 but a change of managers saw him transferred again to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] the following year.<ref name="England calling" /> 
He began his first period at Charlton Athletic in 1984, helping them to promotion to Division 1 in 1985–86. He then moved to [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] in 1987. He helped them win promotion to the Second Division as Third Division runners-up in his [[1987–88 in English football|first season]].

He returned to Charlton as player/coach under the management of [[Lennie Lawrence]] in 1990 and stayed there for 16 years.

===International career===
Curbishley was capped at [[English Schools' Football Association|schoolboy level for England]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/matchrsl/MatchRslTmSBpg4.html |title=Match results schoolboys (under 15) 1970–1979 |website=England Football Online |publisher=Chris Goodwin & Glen Isherwood |date=11 October 2024 |access-date=12 October 2024}}</ref> and was a regular in the [[England national under-18 football team|England youth team]].<ref name="England calling" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/matchrsl/MatchRslTmU18pg3.html |title=Match results under 18 1971–1980 |website=England Football Online |publisher=Chris Goodwin & Glen Isherwood |date=2 October 2024 |access-date=12 October 2024}}</ref> While at Birmingham City, he won his only [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] cap against Switzerland in 1980.<ref name="England calling" /> He was selected for the [[England national football B team|England B squad]] in 1981, but a fractured kneecap ended his involvement with England.<ref name="England calling" />

==Management career==

===Charlton Athletic===
When Lennie Lawrence left in July 1991, Curbishley became joint manager of the club with [[Steve Gritt]], taking sole command from June 1995 and masterminding the revival of the club's fortunes with two promotions and consolidation into the [[FA Premier League|Premier League]].<ref name="Curbs leaves">{{cite news | date=2006-04-29 | url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/4958402.stm | title=Curbishley to leave Charlton job | work=BBC Sport | access-date=2006-06-12| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060614215122/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/4958402.stm| archive-date= 14 June 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Under Alan Curbishley Charlton won promotion, via the play-offs in 1997–98 after a thrilling play-off final against Sunderland at [[Wembley]]. The match ended in a 4–4 draw with Charlton winning 7–6 on penalty kicks, to take their place in the Premiership for 1998–99. Charlton had a good first month of the season with a 5–0 home win over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and credible 0–0 draws away to [[Newcastle United]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] respectively, which saw Curbishley win Manager of the Month for August. However, after victory over [[Nottingham Forest]], in the first game of October, Charlton won just one more game (against West Ham 4–2), before a dreadful run that yielded only three points from 13 games, including eight consecutive defeats, by February 1999. Charlton then won three in a row against Wimbledon, Liverpool and Derby, and Curbishley was again Manager of the Month, but the damage was already done. Charlton won just two more games before the end of the season. The double was completed over the Hammers and [[Aston Villa]] were beaten 4–3, leaving the Addicks needing a last-day victory over [[Sheffield Wednesday]] while hoping that Southampton failed against [[Everton F.C|Everton]]. Charlton lost and Southampton won so the Addicks were relegated back to Division One.

The club resisted the knee-jerk reaction to relegation of replacing their manager, and keeping that continuity proved an investment that paid dividends. With the prolific [[Andy Hunt (footballer)|Andy Hunt]] netting 24 league goals, aided by [[Clive Mendonca]] on 9, [[John Robinson (footballer, born 1971)|John Robinson]] and [[Graham Stuart (footballer)|Graham Stuart]] on 7 and [[Richard Rufus]] on 6, Charlton stormed to the First Division championship winning 27 of their 46 league games to take the title with 91 points, two points ahead of [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Then, as if quashing any doubts about their title-winning form, Charlton thumped City 4–0 on the opening day of the Premiership.

Charlton didn't have a prolific scorer in 2000–01 and again the goals were more widespread among the team. [[Jonatan Johansson (footballer)|Jonatan Johansson]] finished top scorer with 11 league goals, and [[Shaun Bartlett]], [[Claus Jensen]], Graham Stuart and [[Mathias Svensson]] all hit five each. A couple of useful unbeaten runs kept Charlton around mid-table position, although they were fifth in September after beating Newcastle. The best sequence, nine games unbeaten, came between the last game of 2000, when the league double was completed over Manchester City, 4–1, and a goalless draw with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] that left the Addicks in eighth place. Eventually Charlton finished the campaign in a convincing ninth place – some highlights included a 3–3 draw at home to Manchester United and wins at home against Chelsea and Arsenal.

The following season started similarly in that the team reached as high as eighth at the turn of the year, but no wins in the final eight games brought them perilously close to the drop. In the end, though, three draws from the last four games ensured safety in 14th place. Ably assisted by [[Keith Peacock]] and [[Mervyn Day]], Alan Curbishley built a sound squad capable of holding its own in the elite league with a good balance of experience and youth, with [[Chris Bart-Williams]], [[Chris Powell]] and Graham Stuart alongside up and coming youngsters [[Scott Parker]] and [[Luke Young (footballer born 1979)|Luke Young]]. It looked as if the team might make a real impact and five successive wins in early 2003 elevated the side to sixth, although defeat by Arsenal started a run of eight defeats in the last 10 games for a 12th-place finish.

Charlton did so well in 2003–04 that they even threatened to claim a Champions League slot for a large part of the campaign; this eventually resulted in a 7th-place finish by the end of the season. Curbishley continued to mastermind their consolidation over the next two seasons with 11th- and 13th-place finishes. During the 2005–06 season, he also celebrated his 600th game in charge of the team with a 1–0 victory at one of his old clubs, Birmingham, in September 2005.<ref>{{cite news | date=2006-02-17 | url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4722748.stm | title=Birmingham 0–1 Charlton | work=[[BBC Sport]] | access-date=2007-06-12}}</ref> [[Darren Bent]] scored the goal.

Throughout his time at Charlton, Curbishley was frequently linked with higher-profile managerial positions. In 2004, he was one of the main candidates to become manager of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]];<ref>{{cite news | date=2004-05-31 | url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/3764431.stm | title=Liverpool close in on new boss | work=[[BBC Sport]] | access-date=2012-05-17}}</ref> reportedly being the favoured choice of club [[Captain (association football)|captain]] [[Steven Gerrard]], amongst others.<ref>{{cite news | date=2010-10-12 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/alan-curbishley-englishmen-getting-raw-deal-in-top-flight-jobs-2104010.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014200317/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/alan-curbishley-englishmen-getting-raw-deal-in-top-flight-jobs-2104010.html |archive-date=2010-10-14 |url-access=limited |url-status=live| title=Alan Curbishley: 'Englishmen getting raw deal in top flight jobs| newspaper=[[The Independent]] | access-date=2012-05-17}}</ref> Two years later, he was one of several candidates interviewed by [[the Football Association]] for the vacant position of [[England national football team manager|England manager]].<ref name="Curbs leaves" /> Former England manager [[Bobby Robson|Sir Bobby Robson]] described Curbishley as being "the best equipped [candidate] to deal with the pressures of running a top international side."<ref>{{cite news | date=2006-01-24 | url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentonline/newsarchive.aspx?articleid=24703 | title=Sir Bobby: Curbs is the man for England job| publisher=Kent Online| access-date=2012-05-17}}</ref> The post, however, eventually went to [[Steve McClaren]].<ref>{{cite news | date=2006-05-04 | url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/4969592.stm | title=McClaren named as England manager | work=[[BBC Sport]] | access-date=2006-08-18| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060823014313/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/4969592.stm| archive-date= 23 August 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>

After declining to extend his contract with Charlton, Curbishley agreed to leave the club at the end of the 2005–06 season.<ref name="Curbs leaves" /> He received a [[standing ovation]] from the Charlton supporters in his final home match in charge against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. Curbishley managed his final game as manager of Charlton away to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 7 May 2006, which Charlton lost 4–0. Overall, he managed 729 games for the Addicks, just one fewer than the record held by [[Jimmy Seed]].

Curbishley continues to be regarded as one of Charlton's greatest ever players and managers. On 9 April 2021, Charlton announced that, from the start of the 2021/22 season, the East Stand at the Valley would be renamed to the 'Alan Curbishley Stand' in celebration of the 30th anniversary of Curbishley taking charge of the club as manager.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cafc.co.uk/news/view/60703ffe39d3c/east-stand-to-be-renamed-the-alan-curbishley-stand|title=East Stand to be renamed the Alan Curbishley Stand}}</ref>

===West Ham United===
After a short spell away from management, during which he worked as a television [[pundit (expert)|pundit]], Curbishley was appointed as manager of West Ham United in December 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/6171205.stm |title=Curbishley named West Ham manager |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=13 December 2006 |access-date=18 August 2007}}</ref> After looking certain for relegation, Curbishley led West Ham to seven wins out of their last nine games, beating [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and a 1–0 win at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on the last day of the season, to keep West Ham in the Premier League.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/6652329.stm |title=Magnusson hails West Ham survival |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=14 May 2007 |access-date=18 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823144317/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/6652329.stm |archive-date=23 August 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[2007–08 Premier League]] season was relatively successful for Curbishley, as he led the club to a top-ten finish despite long-term injuries to many of the key signings he had made that summer, including [[Scott Parker (footballer)|Scott Parker]], [[Craig Bellamy]], [[Kieron Dyer]] and [[Julien Faubert]]. Before the start of the [[2008–09 Premier League]] season, there was ever increasing speculation about his future at the club.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/bilic-stands-by-as-curbishley-fights-for-future-at-upton-park-28445326.html |title=Bilic stands by as Curbishley fights for future at Upton Park |newspaper=Belfast Telegraph |date=29 August 2008 |access-date=12 August 2021}}</ref>

Despite the club taking six points from their first three games, he was unhappy with the club's transfer policy, after key players [[Anton Ferdinand]] and [[George McCartney (footballer)|George McCartney]] were sold without his permission,<ref name="guardian1">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/03/westhamunited.premierleague1 |title=Alan Curbishley resigns as West Ham manager |first=Paul |last=Doyle |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=3 September 2008 |access-date=12 March 2010}}</ref> a claim denied by the West Ham United board of directors,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/7597097.stm |title=Curbishley 'made transfer errors' |website=BBC Sport |date=8 September 2008 |access-date=24 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/04/mmcartney.westham |title=McCartney: West Ham owners undermined Curbishley |first=Taimour and agencies |last=Lay |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=4 September 2008 |access-date=24 August 2020}}</ref> and he resigned his post on 3 September 2008.<ref name="guardian1"/>

On 3 November 2009, Curbishley won his case for [[constructive dismissal]] against West Ham United. After the ruling, he said: "I am obviously delighted with this result. I very much enjoyed my time at West Ham and never wanted to leave, but on joining the club I insisted that my contract contained a clause confirming that I would have final say on the selection of players to be transferred to and from the club."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.com/article/alan-curbishley-verdict-leaves-west-ham-facing-increased-financial-pressure-cp2lm777l5d |title=Alan Curbishley verdict leaves West Ham facing increased financial pressure |first=Nick |last=Szczepanik |newspaper=[[The Times]] |location=London |date=4 November 2009 |access-date=26 September 2024 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20240926201108/https://www.thetimes.com/article/alan-curbishley-verdict-leaves-west-ham-facing-increased-financial-pressure-cp2lm777l5d |archive-date=26 September 2024}}</ref> West Ham paid him £2.2&nbsp;million in compensation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.com/article/west-ham-united-settle-2-2m-compensation-claim-with-alan-curbishley-dmzgpft5lgc |title=West Ham United settle £2.2m compensation claim with Alan Curbishley |first=Gary |last=Jacob |newspaper=[[The Times]] |location=London |date=18 February 2010 |access-date=26 September 2024 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240926201757/https://www.thetimes.com/article/west-ham-united-settle-2-2m-compensation-claim-with-alan-curbishley-dmzgpft5lgc |archive-date=26 September 2024}}</ref>
