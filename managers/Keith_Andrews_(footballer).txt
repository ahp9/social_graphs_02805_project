'''Keith Joseph Andrews''' (born 13 September 1980) is an Irish  [[association football|football]] coach and former player who played as a [[defensive midfielder]]. He is currently the head coach of {{English football updater|Brentfor}} club [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brentford appoint Keith Andrews as set-piece coach |url=https://www.brentfordfc.com/en/news/article/first-team-keith-andrews-appointed-brentford-set-piece-coach |access-date=1 July 2024 |website=www.brentfordfc.com}}</ref>

Andrews began his career at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], where he was their youngest [[Captain (association football)|captain]] in over a century. His club career also involved stints at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]], as well as loan spells at [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] while he was at Wolves. While at Milton Keynes Dons he was club captain, and helped secure promotion for his team with a vital goal, helped win his team the [[Football League Trophy]] by scoring in the final at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] and they were named in the [[PFA Team of the Year]].

He joined [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in September 2008 and spent three seasons at [[Ewood Park]] which included a loan spell at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. After a short stay with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] Andrews joined [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and after loans at [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and a return to Milton Keynes Dons he retired in the summer of 2015.

A full international from 2008 to 2012, Andrews gained 35 caps for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and was selected for [[UEFA Euro 2012]].

==Club career==

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
Andrews began his career as a trainee at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]], progressing from their academy to the second team. He made his senior debut on 18 March 2000 in a 2–1 win at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon]]. He continued his progress with the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club in the [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01 season]], becoming a regular player as [[Dave Jones (footballer, born 1956)|Dave Jones]] took over midway through. He went on a loan spell at Oxford United, scoring once against Swansea City.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_2/1016610.stm|title=Swansea 1–2 Oxford|publisher=BBC 
|date=11 November 2000 |access-date=12 January 2010}}</ref> Back at Wolves, the final match of that season saw him become their youngest captain for more than a hundred years, at 21 years old, in a game against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].

He signed a new four-year deal the following season but found himself out of the starting line-up after several new midfielders were acquired in the summer, resigning him to the substitutes bench and sporadic appearances over the next few seasons. To gain playing time, he spent half of the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]] season on loan at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and the latter half at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]], where he scored two league goals against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. He did however return to [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]] in between to make his only [[Premier League]] appearance for Wolves (against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]).

The midfielder returned to Wolves' team post-relegation in [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]] and gained his most appearances for the club during that season. However, he moved on at the end of his contract to join [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. In total, he made 72 appearances for the Midlanders, scoring once in a [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] tie at [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/league_cup/3585770.stm|title=Rochdale 2–4 Wolves|publisher=BBC |date=23 August 2004 |access-date=12 January 2010}}</ref>

===Hull City===
His new start with Hull saw him sidelined again though, as he picked up an injury in only his second appearance for the team – in a match against his previous team, Wolves. He returned to the team in December after nearly four months out and featured in all but one of their remaining fixtures in what proved to be his only season for the club.

===Milton Keynes Dons===
After a single year at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], he moved to [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] of [[EFL League Two|League Two]] for the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] campaign where he became club captain. He lost out on promotion in the [[Football League Two play-offs#2007|play-offs]], despite scoring in the semi-final tie with [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]].

However, the next year, now under the management of his former [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] teammate [[Paul Ince]], brought Andrews success. He scored the winning goal in a match at [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] on 19 April 2008 that saw the club promoted to [[EFL League One|League One]], and also scored the opening goal of their 2–0 victory over [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] with a penalty in the [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophy]] at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/7309420.stm | work=BBC News | title=Grimsby 0–2 MK Dons | date=30 March 2008 | access-date=7 May 2010 | first=Mark | last=Mitchener}}</ref> The season ended with him being voted into [[PFA Team of the Year]] and having already won the League Two Player of the Year Award at the Football League Awards. Andrews was then named at number 38 in a ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' poll of the top 50 football league players, as well as being named the best player in League 2.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/footballleagueawards/archive/2008/03/02/fourfourtwo-50-best-football-league-players.aspx|title=FourFourTwo 50 Best Football League Players|publisher=FourFourTwo|date=2 March 2008|access-date=2 March 2008}}</ref> [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|MK Dons]] then had a fight on their hands to keep hold of their inspirational skipper with interest from a number of [[Premier League|Premiership]] and [[EFL Championship|Championship]] clubs. He featured in MK Dons's first three games of the 2008–09 season but then was sold to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] managed by former manager [[Paul Ince]].

===Blackburn Rovers===
Andrews ended a summer of speculation over his future when he completed a transfer to [[Premier League]] club [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 3 September 2008 in a three-year deal worth and rising up to £1m depending on appearances made for the football club over the coming years.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/blackburn_rovers/7586080.stm | title = Blackburn snap up MK Dons skipper | publisher = BBC Sport | date=28 August 2008}}</ref> The move temporarily reunited him with his former [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|MK Dons]] manager [[Paul Ince]] before he was sacked as Rovers manager. He made his debut as a substitute on 6 September 2008 against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], a game in which Blackburn lost 4–1. Andrews made his home debut against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], on his 28th birthday, Arsenal went on to win the match 4–0. He scored his first goal for Blackburn in the 90th minute during a 2–2 draw with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]. Due to injuries sustained by first team regulars, Andrews featured frequently for the Rovers first team, occupying a defensive central midfield role. In July 2009, Andrews signed a new four-year deal, which saw him contracted to Blackburn until 2013. On 25 September 2010, Andrews came on for [[Steven Nzonzi]] on 66 minutes against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] at [[Bloomfield Road]] in a 2–1 win for his first game of the 2010–11 campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=292977&cc=5739|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715183603/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=292977&cc=5739|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 July 2012|title=Emerton breaks Tangerine hearts|date=25 September 2011|work=ESPN Soccernet |access-date=8 June 2011}}</ref>
The [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11]] season was a frustrating one for Andrews as he only made six appearances in all competitions for Rovers due to injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clicklancashire.com/sport/blackburn-rovers-fc/129202-blackburn-rovers-midfielder-keith-andrews-set-to-miss-rest-of-season.html |title=Blackburn Rovers midfielder Keith Andrews set to miss rest of season |access-date=12 August 2011 |date=24 March 2011 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008032906/http://www.clicklancashire.com/sport/blackburn-rovers-fc/129202-blackburn-rovers-midfielder-keith-andrews-set-to-miss-rest-of-season.html |archive-date= 8 October 2011 }}</ref>

====Ipswich Town (loan)====
Andrews agreed to a six-month loan move to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] on 12 August 2011.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/14493110 | title = Ipswich Town sign Keith Andrews from Blackburn Rovers| access-date = 12 August 2011 | date = 12 August 2011 | work=BBC News}}</ref> This loan includes an option to buy the player permanently.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.greenun24.co.uk/ipswich-town/andrews_blackburn_blast_as_he_joins_town_on_loan_1_992117 | title = Andrews' Blackburn blast as he joins Town on loan | access-date = 12 August 2011 | date = 12 August 2011 | archive-date = 17 August 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160817045752/http://www.greenun24.co.uk/ipswich-town/andrews_blackburn_blast_as_he_joins_town_on_loan_1_992117 | url-status = dead }}</ref> A day later he made his debut in a 1–0 loss to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and then 3 days later his first goal came against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. This was followed by goals against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. Steve Kean, the head coach of Blackburn Rovers, hinted that Andrews' may return to his parent club in January 2012, after a successful loan spell with Ipswich. This was contrary to Andrews' ambitions, who when responding to reports that [[Paul Jewell]], the Ipswich head coach, wanted to sign him on a permanent deal, stated in an interview with the [[BBC]] that, "I don't particularly like the way I was treated at the club [Blackburn]. Not just the manager, the club in general."<ref>{{cite news|title=Ipswich Town quiet on move talks – Keith Andrews|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16290202|access-date=24 December 2011|newspaper=21 December 2011|date=21 December 2011}}</ref>

===West Bromwich Albion===
Andrews completed a late deadline day (31 January 2012) free transfer to Albion, after handing in a transfer request at Blackburn. Andrews signed a six-month contract. On 12 February, Andrews scored his first goal for West Brom and their fourth against former club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] in a 5–1 win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wba.co.uk/page/News/0,,10366~2595788,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202141730/http://www.wba.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10366~2595788%2C00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 February 2012 |title=Andrews seals late Baggies switch |publisher=West Bromwich Albion |date=29 April 2012 |access-date=3 May 2012 }}</ref> Andrews then made it two goals in two appearances as he scored Albion's fourth in a 4–0 victory over [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] two weeks later. Andrews then made it three wins in three appearances as he produced another solid performance in the 1–0 win over [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

==International career==
[[File:IrelandAlgeria2010.JPG|thumb|right|Keith Andrews (number 20) in a 2010 friendly for Ireland against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]]]] 
Andrews made his full international debut for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] on 19 November 2008, coming on as a second-half substitute and scoring a goal as part of a 3–2 home defeat in a friendly match against [[Poland national football team|Poland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=284&catid=1&Itemid=8|title=Ireland suffer defeat against clinical Poland side|publisher=FAI|date=18 June 2009|access-date=18 June 2009}}</ref> He played his first competitive match for Ireland, being unlucky to have a goal disallowed in a 2–1 [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 8|World Cup qualification]] group match victory over [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Republic of Ireland 2–1 Georgia.

After being ever-present in Ireland's midfield during their 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, he missed the start of their [[UEFA Euro 2012]] campaign due to an injury-hit [[2010-2011 Premier League|Premier League]] season. He returned to the Irish squad for the [[Nations Cup (football)|Nations Cup]] games against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. He made an instant comeback to the Irish team with a good all round performance against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]].

On 7 June 2011, Andrews scored his second international goal in a 2–0 victory over four-time [[FIFA World Cup]] winners [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in a friendly game in [[Liège]], Belgium.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/13662923|title=Italy 0–2 Republic of Ireland|date=7 June 2011 |work=BBC Sport|access-date=8 June 2011}}</ref> His third international goal came in the shape of Ireland's first goal, a header, in the 4–0 victory in the first leg of the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] play-off against [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] in [[Tallinn]], the second leg of which secured qualification for UEFA Euro 2012 with a 1–1 draw in Dublin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2011/1111/estonia_ireland_report.html |last=Houston |first=Rory |title=Estonia 0–4 Republic of Ireland |date=11 November 2011 |publisher=RTÉ Sport |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113005410/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2011/1111/estonia_ireland_report.html |archive-date=13 November 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2011/1115/ireland_quotes_players.html |title=Duff – Euro qualification an 'amazing feeling' |date=15 November 2011 |publisher=RTÉ Sport |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116162307/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2011/1115/ireland_quotes_players.html |archive-date=16 November 2011 }}</ref>

Andrews played every moment of Ireland's UEFA Euro 2012, until the very end of the final game when he was sent off against Italy. On 10 June 2012, in Ireland's first game of [[UEFA Euro 2012 Group C|Group C]] against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], Andrews failed to score despite having a number of clear shots on goal and actually succeeding in hitting the woodwork; Ireland fell to Croatia by a score of 3–1.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/euro-2012/2012/0610/324424-republic-of-ireland-beaten-in-euro-opener/|title=Republic of Ireland 1–3 Croatia|date=10 June 2012|work=RTÉ Sport|access-date=10 June 2012}}</ref> Andrews's poor luck continued in the following game as Ireland crashed out of the tournament, falling to [[Spanish national football team|Spain]] by a score of 4–0 on 14 June 2012, before he was led off the field in a rage after receiving a red card in Ireland's final group game against Italy, a game the team lost 2–0.
