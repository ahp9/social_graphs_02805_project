In the round-of-16 match of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] against rivals [[Germany national football team|Germany]], Lampard had a first-half shot at goal that bounced off the crossbar and from TV replays was clearly seen to cross the goal line.

In the [[2020–21 Chelsea F.C. season|following season]], Chelsea made five major acquisitions in the summer transfer window in [[Hakim Ziyech]], [[Timo Werner]], [[Ben Chilwell]], [[Kai Havertz]] and [[Édouard Mendy]]. Chelsea initially started strongly, topping their Champions League group and the Premier League in early December. However, after a run of two wins in eight Premier League matches, Chelsea dropped to ninth and Lampard was dismissed as manager on 25 January 2021.

Following his transfer to Chelsea, Lampard turned against his former club and has since stated: "I remember when [[Joe Cole]] first came to Chelsea he would turn away in disappointment if West Ham lost. I would smile. That's how deeply I felt. I wanted West Ham to lose.
