'''Edward John Frank Howe''' (born 29 November 1977) is an English professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Association football|player]], who is the manager of [[Premier League]] club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].

A [[centre-back]] during his playing career, Howe spent most of his playing career with [[AFC Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], coming up through the youth system and spending eight years with the club, before returning for a second three-year spell to end his career, and retiring from the professional game in 2007. He entered management the following year, taking charge of a Bournemouth side facing relegation to the [[Conference National]] (now National League) in January 2009 as the youngest manager in the Football League.<ref>{{ cite news | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11750_4817560,00.html | title = Howe handed permanent role | date = 19 January 2009 | access-date = 19 January 2009 | publisher = Sky Sports }}</ref> Under his guidance, Bournemouth were able to avoid relegation during his first season in charge, having started the season on minus 17 points, and were promoted to [[EFL League One|League One]] the following campaign. 

After a brief spell as manager at [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], Howe returned to Bournemouth, and led them to two further promotions in three seasons, taking them to the top division of English football. He was subsequently named [[Football League Awards|Football League Manager of the Decade]] in 2015 following three promotions in a seven-year period.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fifield |first=Dominic |title=Eddie Howe writes new chapter for AFC Bournemouth – now for the legacy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/28/eddie-howe-bournemouth-chapter-legacy |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=28 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hassan |first=Nabil |title=Bournemouth achieving the impossible – chairman Jeff Mostyn |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32491830 |website=BBC Sport |date=28 April 2015}}</ref> Bournemouth survived in the [[Premier League]] for the next five seasons under Howe, before suffering relegation to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] in 2020.

In 2025, he delivered a first major domestic trophy for Newcastle in 70 years by winning the [[EFL Cup]].

==Playing career==
Howe was born in [[Amersham]], Buckinghamshire.<ref name="howereturn" /> When very young, he moved to [[Verwood]] in Dorset, and later began his footballing career with local youth teams Phoenix Sports YFC, later to be known as Verwood Town YFC<ref name="howereturn">{{cite web |url=http://www.afcb.co.uk/news/article/2012-10-15-the-return-of-eddie-howe-423795.aspx |title=The return of Eddie Howe |publisher=AFC Bournemouth |access-date=28 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222121438/http://www.afcb.co.uk/news/article/2012-10-15-the-return-of-eddie-howe-423795.aspx |archive-date=22 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and Dexter Sports<ref>{{cite news|title=What's Cherries manager Eddie Howe really like? |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/features/8791516.What_s_Cherries_manager_Eddie_Howe_really_like_/before/ |access-date=22 August 2015 |newspaper=Bournemouth Echo |date=14 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222083104/http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/features/8791516.What_s_Cherries_manager_Eddie_Howe_really_like_/before/ |archive-date=22 December 2015}}</ref> before starting his professional career at [[AFC Bournemouth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.afcb.co.uk/team/staff-profiles/ |title=Eddie Howe |publisher=AFC Bournemouth |access-date=28 April 2015}}</ref> He made his first-team debut in December 1995 against [[Hull City]].<ref name=howereturn/> Howe established himself as an important player in Bournemouth's defence, and in 1998, he was selected for the England Under-21 team in the [[Toulon Tournament]].<ref name=howereturn/>

In March 2002, [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] signed Howe for £400,000, making him new manager [[Harry Redknapp]]'s first signing. Shortly after signing, a knee injury on his debut against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/1898585.stm |title=Preston 2–0 Portsmouth |website=BBC Sport |date=30 March 2002 |access-date=23 March 2012}}</ref> ended his season.

He returned for the opening game of the [[2002-03 in English football|2002–03]] season against [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], but he injured his knee again after only nine minutes<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/2181122.stm |title=Portsmouth 2–0 N Forest |website=BBC Sport |date=10 August 2002 |access-date=23 March 2012}}</ref> and was ruled out for the entire campaign. He did not return to full fitness until January 2004 after 18 months out. He was loaned to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] on transfer deadline day in March, although he did not feature for the club.

Portsmouth loaned Howe back to Bournemouth for the first three months of the [[2004-05 in English football|2004–05]] season. He proved to be successful on his return to his first club after two injury-ravaged seasons with Portsmouth. With the club in a very poor financial state, supporters joined to create "Eddieshare" to fund a transfer fee. Days later, £21,000 was raised to fund the required permanent transfer fee.<ref name=howereturn/> After a further three seasons and over 270 appearances, injuries forced his retirement as a player in 2007 and he then moved into coaching with the reserve squad.<ref name=howereturn/>

==Managerial career==
===AFC Bournemouth===
In December 2006, at the age of 29, Howe was promoted to the position of player-coach by manager [[Kevin Bond (English footballer)|Kevin Bond]], and handed the task of coaching Bournemouth's reserve team, though he continued to play in the first team. He retired from football in summer 2007, after he was unable to recover from a knee injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/bournemouth/6233262.stm |title=Bournemouth defender Howe retires |website=BBC Sport |date=23 June 2007 |access-date=23 April 2009}}</ref> In September 2008, Howe lost his job when Bond was sacked as manager.<ref name=howereturn/>

Howe returned to Bournemouth as a youth coach under [[Jimmy Quinn (Northern Irish footballer)|Jimmy Quinn]] and took over as caretaker manager when Quinn was sacked on 31 December 2008.<ref name="Quinn parts company with Cherries">{{ cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/bournemouth/7806809.stm |title=Quinn parts company with Cherries |date=1 January 2009 |access-date=9 January 2016 |website=BBC Sport }}</ref> Even though his two games in charge as caretaker manager were away defeats, he was hired as the permanent manager of the club on 19 January 2009 and brought the club out of the relegation zone despite them having begun the season with a 17-point deduction.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2009-04-25 |title=Bournemouth 2-1 Grimsby |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_3/8002125.stm |access-date=2025-08-26 |work=BBC Sport |language=en-GB}}</ref>

In the start of the 2009–10 season, Howe won eight out of the nine games, a club record. In November 2009, [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] approached Howe to replace [[Darren Ferguson]] as their manager but Howe rejected their approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/bournemouth/8357037.stm |title= My heart is at Bournemouth&nbsp;— Howe |website=BBC Sport |date=12 November 2009}}</ref>

Despite the club's transfer embargo remaining in place for the rest of the season, Bournemouth secured promotion to [[EFL League One|League One]] after two years in the [[English football league system|fourth tier]] of English football thanks to a 2–0 away win at [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]] on 24 April 2010.<ref name="timesonline1">{{cite news |last1=Christie |first1=Sam |title=Brett Pitman keen to give Eddie Howe all the credit for Bournemouth promotion |url=https://www.thetimes.com/article/brett-pitman-keen-to-give-eddie-howe-all-the-credit-for-bournemouth-promotion-6lb5n6gwv0z |work=[[The Times]] |date=26 April 2010 |language=en}}</ref>

== Managerial style ==
Howe completed his coaching badges with the Irish FA in 2011, implementing a tactically flexible system with the teams that he manages.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Walker |first=Michael |title='Exceptional' Eddie Howe and the coaching course teaching set pieces and sleep patterns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4664804/2023/07/10/eddie-howe-newcastle-coaching-badges/ |access-date=2024-05-26 |work=The New York Times |date=10 July 2023 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Howe's coaching style has been influenced by such football managers as Jurgen Klopp, Johan Cruyff and Diego Simeone, having spent time observing the latter's training methods after leaving Bournemouth.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Taylor |first=Louise |date=2023-02-03 |title=Dark arts and intensity: why Howe's Newcastle are so hard to score against |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/03/why-newcastle-are-so-hard-to-score-against-eddie-howe |access-date=2024-05-26 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Many of Howe's man-management techniques have been influenced by [[John Wooden]], former American college basketball coach.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2021-11-08 |title=Eddie Howe: What can Newcastle expect from new manager? |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/56625105 |access-date=2024-05-26 |work=BBC Sport |language=en-GB}}</ref> 

Tactically, Howe prefers a 4–3–3 in possession, switching to a 4–5–1 out of possession, with an emphasis placed on pressing the oppositions defence, resulting in a higher amount of quick-turnovers.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Walker |first=Michael |title='Exceptional' Eddie Howe and the coaching course teaching set pieces and sleep patterns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4664804/2023/07/10/eddie-howe-newcastle-coaching-badges/ |access-date=2024-05-26 |work=The New York Times |date=10 July 2023 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> During the [[2023–24 Premier League]] season, Newcastle United had increased defensive injuries, forcing Howe to use 3–4–2–1 and 4–4–2, however this meant that the team produced their highest ever goal scoring campaign, netting 85 goals in 38 games.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Newcastle United Stats, Form & xG {{!}} FootyStats |url=https://footystats.org/clubs/newcastle-united-fc-157 |access-date=2024-05-26 |website=footystats.org |language=en}}</ref>
