'''Alexander McLeish''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|OBE}} (born 21 January 1959<ref name="manager profile - Alex McLeish">{{cite web |url=http://www.4thegame.com/club/glasgow-rangers-fc/manager-profile/29192/alex_mcleish.html |title=Manager Profile – Alex McLeish |work=4thegame |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306112803/http://www.4thegame.com/club/glasgow-rangers-fc/manager-profile/29192/alex_mcleish.html |archive-date=6 March 2008}}</ref>) is a Scottish professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Association football|player]]. He played as a [[defender (association football)|defender]] for [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] during their 1980s glory years, making nearly 500 League appearances for the club, and won 77 [[cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].

McLeish started his managerial career with spells at [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] and [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], before guiding [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] to two championships and five cup wins in five years. McLeish spent ten months as manager of the Scotland national team which narrowly failed to qualify for the finals of the [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008 UEFA European championship]]. He then resigned this post in November 2007 to become manager of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], who were in the [[Premier League]] at the time. Though Birmingham were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] at the end of the season, McLeish guided them back to the Premier League in 2009. Birmingham then won the [[2011 Football League Cup Final]], but were relegated again from the Premier League at the end of the 2010–11 season.

Following this relegation he resigned his post at Birmingham to become manager at their city rivals, [[Aston Villa]]. This made him the first manager to move directly from Birmingham City to Aston Villa, and only the second manager after [[Ron Saunders]] to manage both clubs. Having only narrowly avoided relegation in the 2011–12 Premier League season, his contract was terminated by Villa at the end of his first season. McLeish was appointed manager of Championship club [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in December 2012, but left after 40 days by mutual consent.<ref name = "forest exit">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21338533|title=Alex McLeish: Nottingham Forest manager exits City Ground|publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 February 2013 |access-date=5 February 2013}}</ref> He managed [[Belgian Pro League]] club [[K.R.C. Genk|Genk]] in the 2014–15 season, and [[Zamalek SC|Zamalek]] of the [[Egyptian Premier League]] in 2016. He then had a second stint as [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]] manager.

In recognition of his distinguished service to Scottish sport, in 2008 McLeish was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[University of Aberdeen]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/birmingham-city-fc/birmingham-city-fc-news/2008/07/03/alex-mcleish-honoured-by-university-of-aberdeen-97319-21220729/ |title=Alex McLeish honoured by University of Aberdeen |newspaper=[[Birmingham Mail]] |date=3 July 2008 |access-date=4 July 2008 |archive-date=11 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511060636/http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/birmingham-city-fc/birmingham-city-fc-news/2008/07/03/alex-mcleish-honoured-by-university-of-aberdeen-97319-21220729/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Early years==
McLeish was born in Duke Street Hospital, Glasgow to parents Alex, a shipyard worker, and Jean.<ref name="DonOfAnEra">{{cite book |last= McLeish |first= Alex |author2= Alastair Macdonald |title= The Don of an Era |publisher= John Donald Publishers |year= 1988 |isbn= 0-85976-242-4}}</ref> He has younger siblings Angela and Ian. After living in the [[Parkhead]] and [[Kinning Park]] districts of the city, the family moved to [[Barrhead]], [[Renfrewshire (historic)|Renfrewshire]] soon after McLeish had reached school age. He attended Springhill Primary, [[Barrhead High School]] – where he was one year below future Aberdeen and Scotland teammate [[Peter Weir (footballer)|Peter Weir]] – and [[John Neilson High School]] in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]].<ref name="DonOfAnEra"/>

As a juvenile he played for Barrhead Youth Club, alongside Weir, and Glasgow United as well as training for a short period with [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Accies]]. After a local cup final with Glasgow United in 1976 which was watched by a delegation from Aberdeen, including then manager [[Ally MacLeod]], McLeish signed for the Pittodrie club the following day.<ref name="DonOfAnEra"/>

==Playing career==
===Club===
McLeish spent the majority of his first two seasons at [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] in the reserves and also had a loan spell at local Junior side [[Lewis United F.C.|Lewis United]].<ref name=AFC>{{cite web|url=http://www.afcheritage.org/history/darkbluedons/index.cfm?player_id=22 |title=Dark Blue Dons: Alex McLeish |publisher=AFC Heritage Trust |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref> McLeish won the Scottish 2nd XI Cup with the ''Dons'' in 1978.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://afcheritage.org/matches/match-report?id=6812 | title = Rangers 0 - 0 Aberdeen: Scottish Second XI Cup Final Second Leg | website = AFC Heritage | access-date = 30 May 2023 }}</ref> He made his competitive debut under [[Billy McNeill]] in a New Year fixture against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] on 2 January 1978.<ref name="DonOfAnEra"/> His first major final appearance was under the management of [[Alex Ferguson]] as a substitute in a 2–1 defeat to Rangers in the [[1978 Scottish League Cup Final|1978–79 League Cup]] and most of his appearances during the 1970s were as a [[midfielder]], with [[Willie Garner]] and [[Doug Rougvie]] preferred in defence.<ref name=AFC/> However McLeish eventually made the centre-back position his own, and over the next seven seasons he enjoyed great success, winning eight domestic and two European trophies. Highlights included scoring in a 4–1 victory over Rangers in the [[1982 Scottish Cup Final]] on his 200th Dons appearance, and a vital goal against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] during the campaign leading to the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] win over [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in [[1983 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1983]].<ref name="Factfile">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/scotland/1704404.stm |title=Alex McLeish Factfile |date=11 December 2007 |access-date=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sir Alex's five dates with destiny |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=eng/news/newsid=1949516.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509162516/http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=eng/news/newsid=1949516.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 May 2013 |work=[[UEFA]] |publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) |date=8 May 2013 |access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref>

During this period, McLeish formed a formidable [[defender (football)|defensive]] triumvirate with [[Willie Miller]] and [[Jim Leighton]] for both club and country.<ref name=AFCWM>{{cite web|url=http://www.afcheritage.org/history/darkbluedons/index.cfm?player_id=707 |title=Dark Blue Dons: Willie Miller |publisher=AFC Heritage Trust |access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref> Even after he had won his first [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] cap, McLeish's father asked then Aberdeen boss Alex Ferguson to persuade him to continue training as an [[accountant]]. When Ferguson left in 1986 to go to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], he tried to get McLeish to sign, but it did not work out; he also had talks with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. A [[testimonial match]] was arranged for McLeish in December 1988, with the club's '[[Gothenburg]]' (Cup Winners' Cup) squad taking on an 'International legends' team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afcheritage.org/matches/fixtures/mreport.cfm?fixture_id=6192&season=1988-89&squad=Senior|title=Match Report|website=AFC Heritage Trust|date=13 December 1988|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/evening-express-city-final/20180625/282235191390413|title=In the news: 1988|work=[[Evening Express (Scotland)|Evening Express]]|via=[[PressReader]]|date=25 June 2018|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref> He won the [[Scottish Football Writers' Association|Scottish player of the year]] in 1990,<ref name="Factfile"/> after [[1989–90 in Scottish football|a season]] in which Aberdeen won both domestic cups.

He became captain of Aberdeen after the retirement of Willie Miller. His 692 competitive appearances for the club ranks as the [[List of Aberdeen F.C. records and statistics#Most appearances|second-most in its history]] (100 behind Miller, but almost 100 more than [[Bobby Clark (footballer, born 1945)|Bobby Clark]]).

===International===
McLeish is Scotland's sixth most capped player, having gained 77 international caps between 1980 and 1993.<ref name="Roll of Honour">{{cite news |url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=350 |title=International Roll of Honour |access-date=16 October 2007 |publisher=[[Scottish Football Association]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024132216/http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=350 |archive-date=24 October 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> He was first capped for the [[Scotland Under-21 national football team|Scotland under-21]] team while still a reserve player at Aberdeen by his former club manager Ally MacLeod, eventually gaining six caps at that level. His full international debut came on 26 March 1980 against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], manager [[Jock Stein]] playing him in midfield alongside [[Archie Gemmill]] and [[Graeme Souness]].<ref name="DonOfAnEra"/> He played in three [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] with [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]].<ref name="Factfile"/> He is a member of the [[Scottish Football Hall of Fame]], the [[Scotland national football team roll of honour]]<ref name="Roll of Honour"/> and [[Scottish Television]]'s fan poll ''Scotland's Greatest Team''.<ref name=greatest>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/tv-review-scotland-s-greatest-team-1-801209|title=TV review: Scotland's Greatest Team|work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=23 April 2010 |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref> On the occasion of his 50th cap, against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] in 1987, McLeish was appointed team captain for the game.<ref name="DonOfAnEra"/> His final cap came on 17 February 1993 in a 3–0 win over [[Malta national football team|Malta]] at [[Hampden Park]] during the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] qualifiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/scotland/alex-mcleish-4800/scottish-caps-part-2-1986-93_a11925/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910095152/http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/scotland/alex-mcleish-4800/scottish-caps-part-2-1986-93_a11925/|url-status=dead|title=Alex McLeish - Scottish Caps (Part 2) 1986-93 - Scotland|date=10 September 2012|archive-date=10 September 2012}}</ref>

==Management career==

===Motherwell===
After his successful playing career he quickly went into football [[Manager (association football)|management]] with [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] in 1994, one year before he retired as a player.<ref name="Factfile"/> His [[1994–95 in Scottish football|first season]] at Motherwell saw him take the Lanarkshire club to second in the Premier Division behind [[Walter Smith]]'s [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].<ref name="Factfile"/> However, he failed to build on this success and the next two seasons were spent in relegation battles. He resigned as manager to take over at [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in 1998.<ref name="Factfile"/>

===Hibernian===
McLeish took over a struggling Hibernian side, which was relegated from the [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Scottish Premier Division]] in [[1997–98 in Scottish football|1998]] despite a slight upturn in fortunes under McLeish. He then guided the [[Edinburgh]] team back to the [[Scottish Premier League]] at the first attempt by winning the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] championship.<ref name="Factfile"/>

Hibernian consolidated in their first season back in the top division, finishing mid-table and reaching the [[Scottish Cup]] semi-final.<ref name="Factfile"/> In the 2000–01 season, Hibs started very strongly. Eventually they had to settle for third place and a [[2001 Scottish Cup Final|Scottish Cup final]] appearance.<ref name="Factfile"/> This performance attracted the attention of bigger clubs, including [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and Rangers.

McLeish attracted players such as [[Russell Latapy]] and former [[France national football team|French]] international [[Franck Sauzée]] to Hibs. He also helped develop young striker [[Kenny Miller]], who would later go on to play 69 games for Scotland.

During this period McLeish worked towards and was awarded a [[UEFA Pro Licence]].<ref name="Andy caps his return to the big time">{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20001105/ai_n13953165/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513121725/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20001105/ai_n13953165/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 May 2011 |title=Andy caps his return to the big time |first=Michael |last=Grant |date=5 November 2000 |access-date=25 March 2010 |newspaper=[[Sunday Herald]] |format=reprint |publisher=[[FindArticles]]}}</ref><ref name="England could learn from Scottish system">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/scotland/2327013/England-could-learn-from-Scottish-system.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120918120703/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/scotland/2327013/England-could-learn-from-Scottish-system.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 September 2012 |title=England could learn from Scottish system |first=Henry |last=Winter |date=29 November 2007 |access-date=25 March 2010 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>

===Rangers===
His work at Hibs was noticed, and he was linked with several moves to England, before he was appointed as [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] manager in December 2001<ref name="Rangers appointment">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/1701609.stm |title=Rangers unveil McLeish |date=11 February 2001 |access-date=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> after outgoing Rangers manager [[Dick Advocaat]] recommended McLeish to chairman [[David Murray (Scottish businessman)|David Murray]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/advocaat-s-vested-interest-in-the-improbable-dream-1.866731 |title=Advocaat's vested interest in the improbable dream |date=9 October 2007 |access-date=25 March 2010 |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |first=Darryl |last=Broadfoot |author-link=Darryl Broadfoot}}</ref>

McLeish was an instant success at Rangers, winning both the [[Scottish Cup]]<ref name="Celtic 2-3 Rangers">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scottish_cup/1966673.stm |title=Rangers win Old Firm final |date=4 May 2002 |access-date=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> and [[Scottish League Cup]]<ref name="Ayr Utd 0-4 Rangers">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/cis_ins_cup/1875551.stm |title=Rangers lift CIS Cup |date=17 March 2002 |access-date=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> in his [[2001–02 in Scottish football|first season]], but the big prize of the league title was essentially lost before his arrival.

Rangers' worsening financial state saw many of his top players leave in the summer of 2003. [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] won the league comfortably in [[2003–04 in Scottish football|season 2003–04]], and Rangers failed to win any trophies.<ref name="Rangers Bio">{{cite web|url=https://rangers.co.uk/club/history/former-managers/alex-mcleish/|title=Past Managers – Alex McLeish|access-date=16 October 2007|publisher=Rangers FC }}</ref> McLeish was consequently put under pressure from fans after his poor signings and a record run of seven consecutive [[Old Firm derby]] losses to Celtic.<ref name="Bosses talk up Old Firm meeting">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_div_1/3997583.stm |title=Bosses talk up Old Firm meeting |date=9 November 2004 |access-date=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

The high-profile [[Bosman ruling|Bosman]] signings of [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] and [[Dado Pršo]] in the close season of [[2004–05 in Scottish football|2004–05]] gave Rangers renewed hope of regaining the title from Celtic's grasp.<ref name="Prso capture sees McLeish celebrate">{{cite news |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/top-stories/Prso-capture-sees-McLeish-celebrate.2527597.jp |title=Prso capture sees McLeish celebrate |date=10 May 2004 |access-date=25 March 2010 |work=[[The Scotsman]] |first=Angus |last=Wright}}</ref> McLeish's team won the [[2004–05 Scottish Premier League|2005 league title]] on a dramatic last day, an outcome that had looked highly unlikely after Rangers fell five points behind leaders Celtic with just four games remaining.<ref name="Rangers in dramatic title triumph">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/4570627.stm |title=Rangers in dramatic title triumph |date=22 May 2005 |access-date=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

After this unexpected success, McLeish and his Rangers team headed into the [[2005–06 in Scottish football|2005–06]] SPL campaign as favourites to retain the championship. McLeish made a number of signings, including [[Julien Rodriguez]] and [[Ian Murray (footballer)|Ian Murray]], despite having little money to spend. After a reasonable start to the season, including a win over Celtic,<ref name="Rangers 3-1 Celtic">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/4164472.stm |title=Rangers 3–1 Celtic |date=20 October 2005 |access-date=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> Rangers suffered a series of poor results between September and November. This period included a club record of 10 games without a win. However the tenth match of this run, a 1–1 draw with [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]] in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], took Rangers into the knockout stages of the tournament for the first time.<ref name="Rangers 1-1 Inter Milan">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4494912.stm |title=Rangers 1–1 Inter Milan |date=6 December 2005 |access-date=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

Despite the poor domestic form, McLeish guided Rangers to the [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League knockout stage|last 16]] of the Champions League, where they were defeated on the [[away goals rule]] by [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]].<ref name="Villarreal 1-1 Rangers">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4778246.stm |title=Villarreal 1–1 Rangers (agg 3–3) |date=7 March 2006 |access-date=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> They became the first Scottish team to progress this far in the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] since 1993, and the first Scottish team to progress through a European group stage.<ref name="Rangers 1-1 Inter Milan"/> In December, chairman [[David Murray (Scottish businessman)|David Murray]] publicly announced his support for McLeish.<ref name="McLeish receives Murray's backing">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/4503564.stm |title=McLeish receives Murray's backing |date=8 February 2005 |access-date=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> Rangers then went on a good run of results in December and January.

It was later announced that he would be succeeded by former [[Olympique Lyonnais]] manager [[Paul Le Guen]].

[[File:AlexMcLeish 2009 pre-season cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|McLeish as [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] manager in 2009]]
