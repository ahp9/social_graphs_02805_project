'''William Arthur Bonds''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MBE}} (born 17 September 1946) is a former professional [[Association football|footballer]] and [[coach (sport)|manager]], who is most often associated with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] with whom he spent 27 years as player and manager. He played 799 first-team games for West Ham in a career spanning 21 seasons.

==Background==
Born in [[Woolwich]], south-east London, Bonds grew up in nearby [[Eltham, London|Eltham]], where he played for a Sunday boys' team, Moatbridge, and Kent Schoolboys and joined the groundstaff at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] after leaving school at 15.<ref name=Bonzo>{{cite book| last =Bonds| first =Billy| title =Bonzo| publisher =Barker| year =1988| location =London| pages =4–14| isbn =978-0-213-16960-2}}</ref> He played in the youth and A team and occasionally in the reserves before joining the playing staff shortly before his 18th birthday in September 1964.<ref name=Bonzo /><ref name=Northcutt1993>{{cite book | last =Northcutt | first =J. |author2=R.

==Club career==
Bonds made his League debut for Charlton against [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] in February 1965 and became a regular in the first team, going on to make 95 League appearances, scoring one goal, before being signed by [[Ron Greenwood]] for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] for a fee of £50,000 in May 1967.<ref name=Northcutt1993 /><ref>{{cite book | last =Cameron| first =C.| title =Home and Away with Charlton Athletic 1920–2004| publisher =Voice of the Valley| year= 2003 | location =London| pages =211–225 | isbn =0-9518125-2-1 }}</ref> He made his first appearance for West Ham in a testimonial match for [[Kenneth Brown (footballer born 1934)|Ken Brown]] in the same month and made his League debut against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the opening game of the 1967–68 season.<ref name=Hogg>{{cite book | last =Hogg| first =T.| title =Who's Who of West Ham United | publisher =Profile Sports Media | year= 2005 | location =London| pages =30–31 | isbn =1-903135-50-8 }}</ref> He was ever-present in the 1968–69 and 1969–70 seasons and played 124 consecutive league games until injury ended his run of appearances in October 1970.<ref name=Northcutt1993 /><ref name=TonyM>{{cite book | last =McDonald| first =T.| title =West Ham In My Day | publisher =Football World | year= 2007 | location =Essex| pages =103–113  | isbn =978-0-9551176-8-8 }}

Bonds played his first three seasons as a right-back before Greenwood switched him to midfield in the 1970–71 season where he counterbalanced the skills of [[Trevor Brooking]].<ref name=TonyM /> Bonds was at his peak in the early 1970s, helping West Ham to the semi-final of the [[Football League Cup]] in the 1971–72 season, where they lost to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] after a second replay, and topping the scorers list at West Ham in the 1973–74 season with 13 goals, including a hat-trick against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref name=TonyM /><ref name=Hayes>{{cite book | last =Hayes| first =D.| title =The Upton Park Encyclopedia: an a-z of West Ham United| publisher =Mainstream | year= 1998 | location =Edinburgh| pages =24–25  | id = OCLC: 60220812 | isbn =1-84018-043-9 }}</ref> After the departure of [[Bobby Moore]] in March 1974, Bonds was appointed to the captaincy and led the club to an [[FA Cup]] final victory over [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 1975 and to the final of the [[1976 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|1976 European Cup Winners' Cup]] despite a groin injury that interrupted the latter half of the 1974–75 season and part of the 1975–76 season. Greenwood moved Bonds from midfield to the back four as centre-half alongside [[Tommy Taylor (footballer b. 1951)|Tommy Taylor]] shortly before the end of the 1976–77 season, where he was able to come out from defence with the ball.

He experienced relegation with West Ham at the end of the 1977–78 season but led West Ham to a second FA Cup victory over [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1980, becoming the only West Ham captain to lift the FA Cup on two occasions. In 1980–81, he led West Ham to the final of the League Cup, which was lost to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] after a replay, and to promotion back to the First Division.

Bonds passed Bobby Moore's club record of appearances in 1982–83 and 'officially' retired in May 1984, relinquishing the captaincy to [[Alvin Martin]]. A spate of injuries to first-team players saw him return to the squad and make 26 league and cup appearances in 1984–85. He missed the entire 1985–86 season due to a toe injury but, having passed his 40th birthday, he was able to re-establish himself in the first-team during the 1986–87 season. A knee injury that forced him out of the last two games of the 1987–88 season led to a decision to finally retire in the summer of 1988, having played his last game at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in April 1988 at the age of 41 years and 226 days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/archive/Billy-Bonds-previously-unseen-pictures-of-the-West-Ham-legend-plus-original-Daily-Mirror-features-and-stories-from-our-archive-article361.html |title=Billy Bonds 6'2", eyes of blue...

Bonds had remained at the club as a player for over 20 years, scoring 48 goals in a club record 663 [[the Football League|League]] appearances. He established himself as a local hero and was the supporters' choice for [[West Ham United#Hammer of the Year|'Hammer of the Year']] in 1971, 1974, 1975 and 1987. He was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in January 1988 and was presented with the [[Professional Footballers' Association|PFA]] Merit Award in April 1988 by his fellow professional players. In May 2013 Bonds was awarded West Ham United's first ever lifetime achievement award.<ref name=Lawhufc>{{cite web |title=Bonzo honoured at Awards Night |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130508/bonzo-honoured-at-awards-night_2236884_3171503 |publisher=Www.whufc.com |access-date=9 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511193859/http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130508/bonzo-honoured-at-awards-night_2236884_3171503 |archive-date=11 May 2013}}</ref>

On 6 February 2019, it was announced that the East Stand at [[London Stadium]] would be renamed the Billy Bonds Stand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47141319|title=West Ham: Billy Bonds gets London Stadium stand named after him|date=6 February 2019|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=6 February 2019}}</ref> The unveiling took place ahead of West Ham's home fixture against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 2 March.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47340494|title=West Ham 2-0 Newcastle United|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 March 2019}}</ref>

==International career==
Bonds was capped twice at England Under-23 international level and was on the bench as a non-playing substitute for the senior international team for a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifying match against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in November 1977. A collision with goalkeeper [[Phil Parkes (footballer born 1950)|Phil Parkes]] in the last game of the [[1980–81 in English football|1980-1981 season]] broke two of Bonds' ribs, and ruled him out of selection for England against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in May 1981. Bonds and [[Alvin Martin]] were in line to make their England debuts in that game.

==Managerial career==
After Bonds retired as a player in 1988, West Ham manager [[John Lyall]] appointed him as youth coach. He unsuccessfully applied for the manager's post when Lyall left the club in July 1989 after West Ham had been relegated. However, when new manager [[Lou Macari]] resigned seven months later, Bonds was appointed manager in February 1990. In his first full season in charge, he took the club to promotion, when they finished as runner-up to [[Oldham Athletic F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in [[1990–91 West Ham United F.C. season|1990-91 season]], also reaching the semi-finals of the [[FA Cup]] where they lost to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. He was awarded a second testimonial in the same season.

West Ham were relegated in the [[1991-92 West Ham United F.C. season|1991–92 season]] in bottom place, but the board kept faith in Bonds and he led them to promotion the [[1992-93 West Ham United F.C. season|following season]], when they finished as runner-up to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].<ref name="BelfastT">{{cite web | title=Billy Bonds honoured with stand named after him at West Ham | website=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk | date=6 February 2019 | url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/billy-bonds-honoured-with-stand-named-after-him-at-west-ham/37787801.html | access-date=11 November 2023}}</ref> Bonds guided West Ham to a 13th-place finish in the [[1993–94 Premier League]].<ref name="BelfastT"/> He resigned in August 1994, just before the new season began, when he was replaced by [[Harry Redknapp]].<ref name="BelfastT"/> He had spells in coaching at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] before making a return to management with [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in May 1997.
