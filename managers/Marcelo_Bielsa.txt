He led Uruguay to two record-breaking wins against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and Argentina before subsequently achieving qualification for the 2026 [[FIFA World Cup]].

==Managerial career==
In 1980, after retiring from playing in football, Bielsa decided to start a career as a football manager. His first job was coaching the youth divisions of [[Newell's Old Boys|Newell's]]. In 1990, he was given the task of managing their first team, where he would go on to win the [[1990–91 Argentine Primera División#Apertura Tournament|1990 Torneo Apertura]] and the 1990–91 Torneo Integración, defeating [[Boca Juniors]] on penalties. Bielsa managed the squad that competed in [[1992 Copa Libertadores Final|the final]] of the [[1992 Copa Libertadores]], losing to [[São Paulo Futebol Clube|São Paulo]] on penalties. Weeks after the Libertadores defeat, Bielsa and [[Newell's Old Boys|Newell's]] won the [[1991–92 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Clausura|1992 Torneo Clausura]].<ref name="nobfifa">{{cite web |date=26 July 2012 |title=Newell's Old Boys |url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=204/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614120207/https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=204/index.html |archive-date=14 June 2009 |access-date=26 July 2012 |url-status=dead |publisher=[[FIFA]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=11 November 2014 |title=Esquadrão Imortal – Newell's Old Boys 1987–1992 |trans-title=Immortal Squad – Newell's Old Boys 1987–1992 |url=https://www.imortaisdofutebol.com/2014/11/11/esquadrao-imortal-newells-old-boys-1987-1992/ |access-date=31 May 2018 |publisher=Imortais do Futebol |language=pt}}</ref> After a period in Mexico, he returned to Argentina and won another league title – the [[1997–98 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Clausura|1998 Clausura]] – while coaching [[Club Atlético Vélez Sarsfield|Vélez Sarsfield]].<ref name=velez/>

===Argentina national team===

In 1998, Bielsa was given the job of manager at Spanish [[La Liga]] side [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]], but he soon left after being offered the management of the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]] later that year, taking over after a four-year period by [[Daniel Passarella]] as manager. At the [[1999 Copa América]], Argentina were beaten 3–0 by [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] in a game where Argentina forward [[Martin Palermo]] missed three penalties and Bielsa was sent off. On Bielsa's post match reaction, [[Tim Vickery]] of the BBC wrote:<blockquote>In the press conference he sat staring into space, refusing to make eye contact with anyone – his usual stance. He was asked what he had made of the referee's performance. If the question was predictable, the answer was anything but. "One doesn't usually have the habit of commenting on referees, but…" he said, leaving everyone to believe he would continue with a rant about a joker running amok with a whistle. Instead he proceeded with, "but in respect of my expulsion, the referee was absolutely correct because I protested in an ill mannered form."<ref name="Vickery" /></blockquote>

Argentina won the qualification group for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], but did not progress through the first knockout round at the tournament.<ref>{{Cite news |date=12 June 2002 |title=Bielsa tactics to blame for our early exit |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2002/06/12/sfwarg13.xml}}{{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Despite this, Bielsa stayed on his position as Argentine manager.

===Chile national team===
[[File:Marcelo Bielsa 2009-03-03.jpg|thumb|Bielsa at a press conference in 2009, Santiago, Chile|left]]
Under Bielsa's guidance, the [[Chile national football team|Chile national team]] underwent many positive and negative historic firsts. For the first time in its history, Chile was able to earn a point playing [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] away in [[Montevideo]]. Chile also suffered their worst defeat ever when playing at home during qualifiers losing 3–0 against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]]. This historic low was repeated with a Chile loss of 3–0 against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], which also marked the first home loss against Brazil in a qualification game in nearly 50 years. On 15 October 2008, however, Bielsa masterminded a 1–0 win over his native Argentina, Chile's first win ever over Argentina in an official match; Argentina's loss prompted the resignation of its coach [[Alfio Basile]].<ref>{{cite news |date=17 October 2008 |title=BBC Football |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7675491.stm |access-date=27 July 2012 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

Chile soundly beat [[Peru national football team|Peru]] 3–1 in [[Lima]], a location where they last won in 1985. Bielsa then led Chile to a 2–0 win at the [[Estadio Defensores del Chaco|Defensores del Chaco Stadium]] against hosts Paraguay, obtaining an away triumph on this location for the first time in almost 30 years. The team continued the road to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] with a victory over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]], 4–0. After a 2–2 tie against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]] in [[Santiago]], and travelling to Brazil to lose 2–4, Chile finally achieved qualification to the World Cup after defeating [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] 4–2, a result that was also Chile's first ever away win against the Colombians.

By helping Chile qualify for a World Cup after two tournament absences, Bielsa attained great popularity there. His appointment brought about visible changes in the Chilean set-up, with the fast-tracking of young talents and a more attacking mindset away from home.<ref>{{cite web |date=21 February 2008 |title=Chile still waiting for a revolution |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=696112.html#chile+still+waiting+revolution |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226113505/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=696112.html#chile+still+waiting+revolution |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 February 2008 |website=FIFA.com}}</ref> Due to the rumors that Bielsa would not continue to lead Chile after finishing their campaign at the World Cup, Chilean fans campaigned for him to remain as coach, with the movement titled "Bielsa is NOT leaving!"<ref>[http://www.bielsanoseva.cl/ ¡Bielsa NO se va!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520061356/http://www.bielsanoseva.cl/ |date=20 May 2010 }}</ref> Chile reached the round of 16 of the World Cup, where they were eliminated by Brazil.<ref>{{Cite news |date=29 June 2010 |title=World Cup 2010: Kaká lifts Brazil out of the ordinary and past Chile |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/28/brazil-chile-world-cup-2010-match-report}}</ref> On 2 August 2010, [[Harold Mayne-Nicholls]], [[Chilean Football Federation|President of the Chilean Football Board]], announced that Bielsa would remain with the Chile team until 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terra.cl/deportes/index.cfm?accion=futbolnacional&id_reg=1470915|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805045818/http://www.terra.cl/deportes/index.cfm?accion=futbolnacional&id_reg=1470915|url-status=dead|title=Bielsa ratificado: "Su objetivo es preparar la próxima generación"|archivedate=5 August 2010|accessdate=14 February 2021}}</ref> Bielsa, however, stated that he would leave his position if Jorge Segovia was elected as the new President of the Chilean Football Board.<ref name="soundsandcolours.com">{{cite web |last=Slater |first=Russ |date=30 November 2010 |title=Chilean Football Loses Their Star Man as Argentine Coach Marcelo Bielso Steps Down as National Coach |url=http://www.soundsandcolours.com/news/chilean-football-loses-their-star-man-as-argentine-coach-marcelo-bielsa-steps-down-as-national-manager/ |access-date=27 July 2012 |publisher=Sounds and Colours}}</ref> He followed through on this threat, despite Segovia's election being annulled, and resigned in February 2011.<ref>{{Cite news |date=4 February 2011 |title=Bielsa resigns as Chile coach |agency=Associated Press |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/latinamerica/story/marcelo-bielsa-resigns-as-chile-coach |access-date=4 February 2011}}</ref>

With Leeds in second place with just four games to go, and thus in the [[Promotion and relegation|automatic promotion]] position ahead of rivals [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], on 19 April, Leeds lost in a shock 1–2 defeat against relegation-threatened [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], with Leeds playing 70 minutes against ten men after Wigan had [[Cédric Kipré]] sent off.

The goal – the first of the game – sparked pandemonium, with Villa's [[Conor Hourihane]], [[Ahmed Elmohamady]], [[Neil Taylor (footballer)|Neil Taylor]] and Leeds' [[Patrick Bamford]] caught up in a fracas with Klich at its centre, which involved additional players from both sides and was eventually broken up by referee [[Stuart Attwell]], Elland Road stewards and other players.

Give the goal!" from the touchline. From the restart, [[Albert Adomah]] essentially walked the ball into net unchallenged by 10 Leeds players, with only a frustrated and disbelieving [[Pontus Jansson]] giving chase and nearly dispossessing the forward. The game remained 1–1 and put the second automatic promotion spot mathematically out of reach for Leeds and saw them enter the play-offs.

For [[Squad number (association football)#Argentina|this formation]], the players are: three [[Defender (association football)|defender]]s, three [[midfielder]]s (one central midfielder with two wide players / wing backs), three attacking midfielders (one No.10 and two wingers) and one centre-forward. The 3–3–3–1 allows quick transitions from defending to attacking, as many of the players used in the formation can perform both defensive and attacking tasks. Moreover, it establishes superiority in numbers in every part of the field, since with this formation his teams could defend with seven players, attack with six or seven players, or protect a scoreline by overwhelming the midfield with six players. To use 3–3–3–1, all players have to quickly set to attacking positions when the ball is in the team's possession, and all players have to aggressively press and recover the ball when it is not in possession, so it requires great teamwork and understanding between teammates.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cox, Michael |title=Why Liverpool and Jürgen Klopp can be a surprisingly exciting combination |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/oct/09/liverpool-jurgen-klopp-tactics-exciting-combination |website=The Guardian|date=9 October 2015 }}</ref>

He adapted to an attacking [[4–3–3]] at Athletic Bilbao (as seen in the [[2012 UEFA Europa League Final]]), with full-backs pushing forward and a converted midfielder in the back line also involved in build-up play, with the pressing and coordination elements still in evidence.

In the [[2018–19 Leeds United F.C. season|2018–19 season]] at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], Bielsa introduced a 4–1–4–1 formation,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hay |first=Phil |date=18 July 2018 |title=Phil Hay's verdict - Forest Green Rovers 1 Leeds United 2: Roofe and Ayling earn Bielsa a debut win |publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post |url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/leeds-united-latest/phil-hay-s-verdict-forest-green-rovers-1-leeds-united-2-roofe-and-ayling-earn-bielsa-a-debut-win-1-9256139 |access-date=19 September 2019}}</ref> with [[Kalvin Phillips]] converted from a [[Midfielder#Box-to-box midfielder|box-to-box]] or attacking midfielder into the deep-lying midfielder.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hay |first=Phil |date=17 August 2018 |title=Leeds United: Midfielder Phillips is lynchpin of the Bielsa revolution |publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post |url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/leeds-united-latest/leeds-united-midfielder-phillips-is-lynchpin-of-the-bielsa-revolution-1-9306238 |access-date=19 September 2019}}</ref> When facing a team who played with two central strikers, Bielsa would switch to the 3–3–3–1,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hay |first=Phil |date=6 April 2019 |title=Marcelo Bielsa admits Mateusz Klich mistake following Leeds United's defeat at Birmingham |publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post |url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/leeds-united-latest/marcelo-bielsa-admits-mateusz-klich-mistake-following-leeds-united-s-defeat-at-birmingham-1-9696411 |access-date=19 September 2019}}</ref> with Phillips dropping further back into the defensive line as a [[centre-back]] or "[[Sweeper (soccer)|sweeper]]",<ref>{{cite web |last=Mewis |first=Joe |date=6 December 2018 |title=The evolution of Kalvin Phillips under Marcelo Bielsa - in their own words |url=https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/kalvin-phillips-marcelo-bielsa-leeds-15508583 |access-date=19 September 2019 |website=Leeds-Live.co.uk}}</ref> or [[Luke Ayling]] shifting from [[Defender (association football)#full-back|right back]].

This signature style of Bielsa's has had so much influence in the football scene that many present coaches – former players under Bielsa's command – are heavily influenced by the style, such as [[Gerardo Martino]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]], [[Diego Simeone]], [[Matías Almeyda]], [[Eduardo Berizzo]], [[Mauricio Pellegrino]], [[Santiago Solari]], [[Andrea Pisanu]]<ref>{{Cite news |last=Farinotti |first=Luca |date=4 November 2020 |title=La filosofia di mister Pisanu, il colto maltese |work=Avvenire |url=https://www.lucafarinotti.com/avvenire-ottobre-2020-luca-farinotti-la-filosofia-di-mister-pisanu-il-colto-maltese/ |access-date=7 March 2023}}</ref> and [[Marcelo Gallardo]]. Current Manchester City manager [[Pep Guardiola]] credited Bielsa as his tactical inspiration and called him the "best manager in the world" in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |title=Guardiola: "Bielsa es el mejor entrenador del planeta" |url=http://www.canalathletic.com/noticias/2012-03-17/guardiola-bielsa-mejor-entrenador-20120317.html |website=canalathletic.com}}</ref> [[Jorge Sampaoli]], former manager of Argentina, [[Sevilla FC]] and Chile, has been described as a "disciple" of Bielsa.

Former Argentina national team captain [[Roberto Ayala]], a defender under Bielsa, stated: "Sometimes we wouldn't see any of the strikers, because he'd have them training at a different time, and it was the same with the midfielders".<ref name="Bielsa still">{{cite web |date=15 August 2007 |title=Bielsa, still mad about the game |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/news/newsid=571108/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130123015538/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/news/newsid=571108/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 January 2013 |access-date=26 July 2012 |publisher=[[FIFA]]}}</ref>

Bielsa is known for watching and collecting numerous football videos to the point of obsession. He edits and analyses each video for each individual player. He also uses statistical software and other technological tools to prepare for games. John Carlin, an English journalist, has stated that Bielsa has "the most learned football library on the planet".<ref>{{cite web |title=La Prensa – Deportes – Un loco con método |url=http://archivo.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2002/junio/09/deportes/deportes-20020609-11.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411231656/http://archivo.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2002/junio/09/deportes/deportes-20020609-11.html |archive-date=11 April 2014 |website=laprensa.com.ni |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Bielsa likes to systematise the game. He says that there are 29 distinct formations in football and believes that every young player should be given the opportunity to experience each of them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKoNmQsgIEQ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/EKoNmQsgIEQ |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=The 29 Formations of Football according to Marcelo Bielsa|website=[[YouTube]]|date=9 April 2017 |accessdate=14 February 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=July 2020}}

Discovered by Bielsa, prolific former Argentina national team striker [[Gabriel Batistuta]] proclaimed Bielsa to be "the one who taught me how to train on rainy days, he taught me everything".<ref>{{cite web |title=Batistuta: "Today, I met Bielsa for the first time since the 2002 World Cup" |url=https://www.foxsports.com.ar/news/356530-batistuta-hoy-me-encontre-con-bielsa-por-primera-vez-desde-el-mundial- |website=Fox Sports}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Bielsa has it taped |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jun/02/worldcupfootball2002.sport8 |access-date=17 August 2018}}</ref> [[Fernando Llorente]], who played under Bielsa at Athletic Bilbao, said of his former coach, "At first he seems tough and he may even annoy you with his persistence and don't-take-no-for-an-answer resilience, but in the end he is a genius."<ref>{{cite web |last=Olé |title=Guardiola tiene razón |url=http://www.ole.com.ar/futbol-internacional/europa-league/titulo_0_665333482.html}}</ref> [[Chile national football team|Chile]] international [[Alexis Sánchez]] said of Bielsa: "I learned a lot from him and it is because of him that I am who I am."<ref>{{Cite news |title='Bielsa is best coach in the world' – potential new Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa and those who know him best |work=Sky Sports |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11715/11394662/bielsa-is-best-coach-in-the-world-potential-new-leeds-boss-marcelo-bielsa-and-those-who-know-him-best |access-date=25 August 2018}}</ref> [[Bayern Munich]] player [[Javi Martínez]] who worked with Bielsa at Bilbao, said that 'Bielsa taught me a lot, how to play as a centre-back and to learn a different style of football, everyone should work with him at least once in their life.'<ref>{{Cite news |title=Bielsa is best coach in the world – potential new Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa and those who know him best |work=Sky Sports |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11715/11394662/bielsa-is-best-coach-in-the-world-potential-new-leeds-boss-marcelo-bielsa-and-those-who-know-him-best |access-date=25 August 2018}}</ref>

Bielsa is credited with the rise of the [[Leeds United]] and [[England national football team|England]] international player [[Kalvin Phillips]], with former [[Leeds United]] manager [[Howard Wilkinson]] stating: "Bielsa can take huge credit for the player that Phillips has developed into".<ref>{{cite news |date=19 July 2021 |title=Howard Wilkinson compares Kalvin Phillips to title-winning Leeds United star |url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/howard-wilkinson-compares-kalvin-phillips-to-title-winning-leeds-united-star-3312825 |access-date=19 July 2021 |website=Yorkshire Evening Post}}</ref>

[[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[France national football team|France]] player [[Benjamin Mendy]] noted for his improvement under Bielsa at [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], said Bielsa had "given back to him the strength and aggressiveness lost last year."<ref>{{cite web |date=20 December 2014 |title=Benjamin Mendy en toute insouciance |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/sports/benjamin-mendy-en-toute-insouciance-20-12-2014-4388823.php |website=[[Le Parisien]] |language=fr}}</ref><ref name="Portail SFR">{{cite web |date=25 February 2018 |title=From Bielsa to Guardiola: Laporte tells his mentors |url=https://sport.sfr.fr/football/premier-league/de-bielsa-a-guardiola-laporte-raconte-ses-mentors.html |access-date=5 June 2018 |publisher=Portail SFR |archive-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142312/https://sport.sfr.fr/football/premier-league/de-bielsa-a-guardiola-laporte-raconte-ses-mentors.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> His club and international teammate [[Aymeric Laporte]] who was given his debut by Bielsa at [[Athletic Bilbao]], described him as a 'mentor' figure,<ref name="Portail SFR" /> while fellow [[France national football team|France]] international [[Dimitri Payet]] who worked with Bielsa at [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] said: "The season with Marcelo Bielsa made me grow, as a man and especially on the field, in the game, he gave me important bases that I still use today." Former [[Lille OSC|Lille]] player [[Nicolas Pépé]] who was signed by Bielsa for Lille described Bielsa as 'special' and a 'great coach'.<ref>{{Cite news |title=LOSC: The confidences of Nicolas Pepe on Marcelo Bielsa |work=10 Sport |url=https://le10sport.com/football/ligue1/losc/losc-les-confidences-de-nicolas-pepe-sur-marcelo-bielsa-413363 |access-date=4 November 2018}}</ref>

Bielsa's unique style continued at Leeds, where to receive a work permit from the UK government, he had to prove "exceptional talent": he did so by compiling a dossier of every formation used in every Championship match during the 2017–18 season, with notes on frequency and variations. Once at the Yorkshire club, he instituted all-day training sessions, gave the first team their own private space at [[Thorp Arch (training ground)|Thorp Arch]], and had sleeping quarters installed in his office so he could devote more time to match analysis. As a motivational tactic, Bielsa once made players pick up litter around the training ground for three hours, as he had been told that was how long an average Leeds fan worked to afford a ticket.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/04/leeds-united-marcelo-bielsa "Perfectionist Marcelo Bielsa brings radical approach to Leeds United"]. ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 6 August 2018</ref>

Some critics have argued that the taxing demands of Bielsa's management style have led to his teams starting a season brightly before a dip in performances as players begin to tire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11715/11663470/marcelo-bielsa8217s-history-of-burnout-is-it-a-myth-about-the-leeds-boss|title=Marcelo Bielsa's history of burnout: Is it a myth about the Leeds boss?|website=Sky Sports|accessdate=14 February 2021}}</ref>

In August 2019, Bielsa was one of the main stars of [[Leeds United]] documentary ''Take Us Home'' documenting the [[2018–19 Leeds United F.C. season|2018–19 season]] on [[Amazon Prime]], featuring in several episodes in voiceover, before doing an interview for the final episode "The End". The documentary was narrated by actor and Leeds United fan [[Russell Crowe]].<ref>{{cite web |date=16 August 2019 |title=Take Us Home: What we learned from Leeds documentary |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49367913 |access-date=21 September 2019 |website=BBC Sport}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=16 August 2019 |title=Amazon documentary reveals how Manchester United player Daniel James' Leeds United transfer collapsed |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/daniel-james-man-utd-leeds-16766666 |access-date=21 September 2019 |website=Manchester Evening News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=16 August 2019 |title=Take Us Home documentary reveals just how close Daniel James was to joining Leeds United |url=https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/take-us-home-amazon-documentary-16765351 |access-date=21 September 2019 |website=leedslive.co.uk |publisher=Leeds Live}}</ref> After Leeds' 4–0 defeat of then-chasing rivals [[West Bromwich Albion]] at home on 1 March 2019 in ''Take Us Home'', Bielsa (through a translator) mused on the nature of victory:
