'''Oliver Glasner''' (born 28 August 1974) is an Austrian professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[Football player|player]] who is the manager of [[Premier League]] club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].

A [[Defender (association football)|defender]] by trade, he spent almost all of his professional career with [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] club [[SV Ried]], winning the [[Austrian Cup]] in 1998 and 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-05-19 |title=Die unglaubliche Trainerkarriere des Oliver Glasner |url=https://volksblatt.at/sport/die-unglaubliche-trainerkarriere-des-oliver-glasner-691435/ |access-date=2023-06-03 |website=Oberösterreichisches Volksblatt |language=de-DE |archive-date=27 November 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241127022225/https://volksblatt.at/sport/die-unglaubliche-trainerkarriere-des-oliver-glasner-691435/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Following his retirement, Glasner worked as an assistant manager at [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] before returning to Ried as manager in 2014. He then spent four seasons as manager of former club [[LASK]], winning promotion to the Austrian top flight, and helping the club finish as runners-up in his final season.

From 2019 until 2023, Glasner worked in German [[Bundesliga]], at [[VfL Wolfsburg]] and [[Eintracht Frankfurt]]. With Frankfurt he won the [[UEFA Europa League]] and led them to the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] knockout stages and [[DFB-Pokal]] final. In 2024, he was named manager of Crystal Palace, where he won the [[FA Cup]], the club's first ever major trophy, in his first full season and qualified them for the [[UEFA Europa Conference League|Europa Conference League]] for the first time.

==Playing career==
Glasner started his career at SV Riedau, and joined the [[2. Liga (Austria)|Austrian second division]] team [[SV Ried]] in 1993.<ref name="GlasnerFra">{{cite news |url=https://profis.eintracht.de/news/oliver-glasner-wird-neuer-cheftrainer-133156 |title=Oliver Glasner wird neuer Cheftrainer |website=Eintracht.de |publisher=Eintracht Frankfurt |language=de|date=26 May 2021 |accessdate=26 May 2021}}</ref>  Ried got promoted to the [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] in 1995. During the [[1997–98 Austrian Cup|1997–98 season]] he won the [[Austrian Cup]] with the club. When Ried went down to second division again in [[2002–03 Austrian Football Bundesliga|2003]], Glasner joined First League team [[LASK]] for the next season, but returned to Ried a year later. Ried returned to the Bundesliga in [[2004–05 Austrian Football First League|2005]], and in the [[2010–11 Austrian Cup|2010–11 season]], Glasner won the Austrian Cup for the second time. On 31 July 2011, he suffered a cut above the eye and a slight concussion during a heading duel in a league match between Ried and [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]]. Nevertheless, he accompanied his team during the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase#Brøndby v Ried|third qualifying round second leg]] against [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]]. After the final heading training session, he developed a [[brain haemorrhage|brain hemorrhage]] on 4 August 2011. He was operated on the same day. Glasner survived the operation, but ended his career on the advice of the doctors on 23 August 2011. He made more than 500 league appearances in his 16-year career.<ref>{{cite news |title=Maierhofer joins Salzburg, Glasner retires |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/01f4-0e794c194615-dc2e26e41497-1000--maierhofer-joins-salzburg-glasner-retires/ |website=[[UEFA]] |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=23 August 2011 |access-date=21 August 2020 }}</ref>

==Managerial career==
===Early career===
In 2006, Glasner completed his [[Master of Business Administration#Germany|Diplomkaufmann]] qualification at the [[University of Hagen]]. He was offered an assistant coach role at Ried in 2012. But Peter Vogl, then honorary president of SV Ried and CEO of [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]], hired Glasner as management assistant, responsible for sports. [[Ralf Rangnick]] asked Glasner that they are looking for an assistant coach to [[Roger Schmidt (football manager)|Roger Schmidt]] in the first-team squad. Two weeks in his role for the 2012-13 season, Salzburg dropped out of European football against F91 Düdelingen from Luxemburg.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kastler |first=Bernhard |last2=Diendorfer |first2=Christian |last3=sport.ORF.at |first3=beide |date=2025-05-29 |title=Fußball: Glasner: „Happel war seiner Zeit voraus“ |url=https://sport.orf.at/stories/3141798/ |access-date=2025-05-30 |website=sport.ORF.at |language=de}}</ref> After their successful two-year spell at Salzburg, finishing as Austrian champions, Glasner did not follow Schmidt to [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Leverkusen]] in the [[Bundesliga|German Bundesliga]], but instead was appointed manager at his former club Ried for the [[2014–15 Austrian Football Bundesliga|2014–15 season]].<ref name="Oliver Glasner wird neuer Trainer der SV Ried">{{cite news|title=Oliver Glasner wird neuer Trainer der SV Ried|url=http://www.nachrichten.at/sport/sv_ried/Oliver-Glasner-wird-neuer-Trainer-der-SV-Ried;art102,1383000|access-date=24 October 2014|publisher=nachrichten.at|date=11 May 2014}}</ref> He started the campaign with two wins: 3–2 against [[SC-ESV Parndorf 1919|Parndorf]] in the [[2014–15 Austrian Cup#First round|first round of the Austrian Cup]] on 11 July 2014; and 3–1 against [[1.

===LASK===
[[File:FC Admira Wacker Mödling vs. LASK Linz 2018-08-12 (028).jpg|thumb|upright|Glasner in 2018]]

Glasner joined LASK in the [[2015–16 Austrian Football First League|2015–16 season]] as a director of sport, as well as manager. Over time, vice president [[Jürgen Werner (footballer, born 1967)|Jürgen Werner]] and Glasner constructed a team with an unmistakable style of play. LASK earned promotion to the first division in Glasner's [[2016–17 Austrian Football First League|second season]], then finished the [[2017–18 Austrian Football Bundesliga]] season in fourth position, earning a place in the [[2018–19 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round|Europa League third qualifying round]]. It was the club's first European campaign since [[1999–2000 UEFA Cup|2000]].<ref name=UEFALask>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0254-0e99d7585cd1-e4b19605d586-1000/|title=Club Brugge v LASK facts|website=[[UEFA]] |publisher=Union of European Football Associations|date=22 August 2019|access-date=2 June 2021}}</ref> In the [[2018–19 Austrian Football Bundesliga|2018–19 season]], LASK finished in second place, just behind perennial champions Red Bull Salzburg, which allowed them to participate in the [[2019–20 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round|UEFA Champions League third qualifying round]].<ref name=UEFALask /> Following his success with LASK, [[Jörg Schmadtke]] hired Glasner to manage [[VfL Wolfsburg]] in the [[Bundesliga]], and [[Valérien Ismaël]] joined LASK as his replacement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vfl-wolfsburg.de/en/news-detail/news-detail/detail/news/oliver-glasner-to-take-over/|title=Oliver Glasner to take over|date=23 April 2019|publisher=vfl-wolfsburg.de|access-date=23 April 2019}}</ref>

===VfL Wolfsburg===
In his [[2019–20 VfL Wolfsburg season|first season]] with Wolfsburg, the club managed to qualify for the [[2019–20 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]], finishing seventh in the [[2019–20 Bundesliga|league]]. Glasner also guided them to the [[2019–20 UEFA Europa League knockout phase#Round of 16|Europa League round of 16 phase]], where they lost 5–1 on aggregate against [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]. In the [[2020–21 Bundesliga]], Wolfsburg finished fourth, qualifying for the [[2021–22 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/article/vfl-wolfsburg-bundesliga-oliver-glasner-europe-frankfurt-cdd5b7262d4fbd22180b8e6d4e710dbd|title=Oliver Glasner leaves Wolfsburg to coach Frankfurt|website=AP News|date=26 May 2021|accessdate=2 June 2021}}</ref> Glasner left Wolfsburg after two seasons, despite qualifying for the Champions League, due to a poor relationship with sporting director [[Jörg Schmadtke]] and some players including club captain [[Josuha Guilavogui]], who said, "I'm happy he's gone."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Who is Crystal Palace's new manager Oliver Glasner? |url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/3903137 |access-date=2024-05-22 |website=www.premierleague.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-09-19 |title=Eiszeit zwischen Eintracht-Trainer Glasner und Wolfsburg-Sportchef Schmadtke |url=https://www.fr.de/eintracht-frankfurt/eiszeit-zwischen-oliver-glasner-und-joerg-schmadtke-90988017.html |access-date=2024-05-22 |website=www.fr.de |language=de}}</ref> [[Mark van Bommel]] joined to succeed Glasner.

In May 2021 Glasner signed a three-year deal until 30 June 2024 as head coach of [[Eintracht Frankfurt]].<ref name="GlasnerFra"/> The start at Frankfurt was challenging. Frankfurt appointed Axel Hellmann as the new chairman of the board, [[Markus Krösche]] succeeded [[Fredi Bobic]] as managing director for sport, [[Ben Manga]] replaced Bruno Hübner as sporting director and the team lost its top scorer, [[André Silva (footballer, born 1995)|André Silva]], to [[RB Leipzig]]. The team lost 2–0 in the [[2021–22 DFB-Pokal#Waldhof Mannheim v Eintracht Frankfurt|first round of DFB-Pokal]] against [[3. Liga|third tier]] [[Waldhof Mannheim]]. Frankfurt were close to the relegation zone in November, managing to win only one league game during the first months – against [[Bayern Munich]] at the [[Allianz Arena]]. It was the first time after 21 years, and after 16 matches they did so.<ref>[https://www.bundesliga.com/de/bundesliga/news/eintracht-frankfurt-fc-bayern-munchen-filip-kostic-matchwinner-auswartssieg-glasner-fjortoft-17514 Eintracht Frankfurt gewinnt beim FC Bayern München: Trapp und Kostic öffnen die Flasche], bundesliga.com, 2021-10-</ref>

Between November and December, Frankfurt won six out of seven, and were placed sixth at the end of the first round of matches. The second half of the season was inconsistent and Frankfurt [[2021–22 Eintracht Frankfurt season#League table|finished the league at 11th place]]. Their European campaign was successful, they advanced to the [[2021–22 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] [[2022 UEFA Europa League Final|final]], for the second time in the club's history (after [[1980 UEFA Cup Final|1980]]) – defeating [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] en route<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-04-14 |title=BREAKING: Frankfurt smash Barcelona 3-2 at Camp Nou to setup semi-final vs West Ham |url=https://www.givemesport.com/87995802-eintracht-frankfurt-beat-barcelona-3-2-to-setup-semi-final-vs-west-ham |access-date=2022-04-14 |website=GiveMeSport |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>[https://sport.orf.at/stories/3095131/ Hinteregger verpasst Saisonfinish und Finale], orf.at, 2022-05-06.</ref> – and won the match 5–4 on [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]] against Scottish club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Frankfurt stayed undefeated for 13 EL games, and qualified for the Champions League for the first time since [[1959–60 European Cup|1960]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web |last=Conroy |first=Alison |date=19 May 2022 |title=Eintracht Frankfurt 1-1 Rangers (AET): Aaron Ramsey misses spot-kick as Ibrox side lose Europa League final on penalties |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/eintracht-frankfurt-vs-rangers/report/463267 |access-date=20 April 2023 |website=Sky Sports}}</ref>

The following season, Glasner led Frankfurt to second place in the [[2022–23 UEFA Champions League group stage|Champions League group stage]] against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]], [[Sporting CP|Sporting]] and [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], but lost in the [[2022–23 UEFA Champions League#Round of 16|round of 16]] against the subsequent Italian champions [[SSC Napoli|Napoli]].<ref name=":1" /> Though they were fourth at the halfway point, Frankfurt only [[2022–23 Eintracht Frankfurt season#League table|finished seventh]], winning two of their last three matches to secure qualification for the [[2023–24 UEFA Europa Conference League|Europa Conference League]].<ref name=":1" /> They also reached the [[2023 DFB-Pokal final|DFB-Pokal final]] against RB Leipzig, but lost 2–0.<ref>{{Cite web |date=3 June 2023 |title=Christopher Nkunku-inspired RB Leipzig beat Eintracht Frankfurt to win DFB Cup |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/rb-leipzig-eintracht-frankfurt-dfb-cup-final-live-team-news-match-stats-kolo-muani-23656 |access-date=3 June 2023 |website=Bundesliga |language=}}</ref> Following a poor second half of the league season, Glasner left Frankfurt at the end of the 2022–23 season, one year earlier than his original contract.<ref name=":1">{{cite news |url=https://profis.eintracht.de/news/zusammenarbeit-mit-oliver-glasner-endet-nach-der-saison-150339|title=Zusammenarbeit mit Oliver Glasner endet nach der Saison|date=9 May 2023|publisher=eintracht.de|access-date=9 May 2023}}</ref> [[Dino Toppmöller]] was his successor.
