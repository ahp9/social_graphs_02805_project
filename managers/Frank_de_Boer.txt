'''Franciscus de Boer''' ({{IPA|nl|ˈfrɑŋɡ də ˈbuːr}};{{efn|''Frank'' in isolation is pronounced {{IPA|nl|frɑŋk|}}.}} born 15 May 1970) is a Dutch former professional [[Association football|footballer]] and current [[Manager (association football)|manager]]. A former [[Defender (association football)|defender]], De Boer spent most of his playing career with [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], winning five [[List of Dutch football champions|Eredivisie titles]], two [[KNVB Cup]]s, three [[Johan Cruyff Shield|Super Cups]], one [[UEFA Super Cup]], one [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], one [[UEFA Champions League]], and one [[Intercontinental Cup (1960–2004)|Intercontinental Cup]]. He later spent five years at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], where he won the [[1998–99 La Liga]] [[List of Spanish football champions|title]], followed by short spells at [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], [[Al-Rayyan SC|Al-Rayyan]] and [[Al-Shamal Sports Club|Al-Shamal]] before retiring.

De Boer is the third-most [[Cap (sport)|capped]] outfield player in the history of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]], with [[List of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps|112 caps]].<ref name=rdb>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27205254 |title=Frank de Boer: Tottenham make contact with Ajax over manager |date=29 April 2014 |access-date=30 April 2014 |work=BBC}}</ref> He [[Captain (association football)|captained]] ''Oranje'' to the semi-finals of both the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000]]. He is the twin brother of [[Ronald de Boer]], with whom he was a teammate at Ajax, Barcelona, Rangers, Al-Rayyan, Al-Shamal and the Netherlands national team.

After retiring from playing, De Boer went into management with the [[Ajax Youth Academy|Ajax youth team]] and as assistant to [[Bert van Marwijk]] with the Netherlands national team. In December 2010, he took over as [[Coach (sport)|manager]] of Ajax and went on to win the [[2010–11 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] title in his first season. In 2013, he received the [[Rinus Michels Award]] for manager of the year in the Netherlands after leading Ajax to their third successive Eredivisie title.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/505335-rinus-michels-award-voor-de-boer.html |title=Rinus Michels Award voor De Boer – NOS Sport |website=Nos.nl|date=10 May 2013 }}</ref> The following year, he became the first manager to win four consecutive Eredivisie titles.<ref name=rdb/> He then had brief spells managing in [[Serie A]] with [[Inter Milan]] in 2016, [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the [[Premier League]] in 2017, and [[Atlanta United FC|Atlanta United]] in [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] from 2018 to 2020. De Boer was appointed head coach of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]] in September 2020, but left less than a year later in June 2021 after the team's disappointing [[Euro 2020]] campaign.

==Club career==
===Ajax===
[[File:De kist wordt naar het graf gedragen, Bestanddeelnr 934-4731.jpg|thumb|Both de Boer brothers were [[pallbearer]]s for their Ajax teammate [[Lloyd Doesburg]], who died aboard [[Surinam Airways Flight 764]]. Frank was second from left.]]
De Boer began his career as a left-back at [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] before switching to centre-back, a position he made his own for many years in the national team. He won both the [[1991–92 UEFA Cup]] and [[1994–95 UEFA Champions League]] while at Ajax, in addition to five [[List of Dutch football champions|Eredivisie titles]] and two [[KNVB Cup]]s. However, after signing a six-year contract extension with Ajax for the [[1998–99 AFC Ajax season|1998–99 season]], he and his twin brother [[Ronald de Boer|Ronald]] took successful legal action to have it voided. Ajax had a verbal agreement that if a lucrative offer for one brother came by, he would be released provided the other stayed. Ajax, however, apparently backed down on that agreement after floating the club on the stock market and pledging to shareholders that it would hold both of the De Boers and build around them a team to recapture the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/29/sports/29iht-soccer.t_14.html The De Boers tackle contract law] New York Times, 29 July 1998.</ref>

===Barcelona===
In January 1999, Frank and Ronald de Boer signed for Spanish [[La Liga]] club [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] for [[Pound sterling|£]]22&nbsp;million, joining their former Ajax manager [[Louis van Gaal]] at the [[Camp Nou]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2474024/1999/01/16/Ultiem-akkoord-Ajax-en-Barcelona.dhtml |title=Ultiem akkoord Ajax en Barcelona |date=16 January 1999 |access-date=30 April 2014 |language=nl |work=Trouw}}</ref> After winning the [[1998–99 La Liga]] [[List of Spanish football champions|title]], they were unable to repeat their earlier triumphs. In 2000, Van Gaal was sacked by Barcelona and Frank suffered the ignominy of testing positive for the banned substance [[nandrolone]] a year later. He was suspended but he was reinstated after a successful appeal.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/1513407.stm |title=De Boer takes on Uefa |date=28 August 2001 |access-date=9 October 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

===Later career===
De Boer briefly moved to [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in the summer of 2003 before joining his brother at [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in January 2004. He made his Rangers debut in a 1–0 win away at Partick Thistle, but in his second appearance for the club he missed the decisive penalty in the shootout as Rangers lost to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in the [[Scottish League Cup]] semi-final.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/3443405.stm |title=Partick Thistle 0-1 Rangers |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=1 February 2004 |access-date=14 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_div_1/3460147.stm |title=Hibernian 1-1 Rangers (4-3 pens) |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=5 February 2004 |access-date=14 April 2020}}</ref> He made a total of 17 appearances for Rangers, scoring two goals against [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/3483411.stm |title=Aberdeen 1-1 Rangers |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=14 February 2004 |access-date=14 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/3549481.stm |title=Rangers 4-0 Dundee |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=20 March 2004 |access-date=14 April 2020}}</ref> The De Boer brothers left Rangers after [[UEFA Euro 2004]] to play the rest of their football careers in Qatar with [[Al-Rayyan SC|Al-Rayyan]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/3705699.stm |title=De Boer to leave Rangers |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=11 May 2004 |access-date=14 April 2020}}</ref> De Boer announced his retirement from football in April 2006.

==International career==
Having represented his national team 112 times,<ref>{{cite news |title=Career Stats |url=http://www.wereldvanoranje.nl/profielen/profiel.php?id=1072 |access-date=14 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722011004/http://www.wereldvanoranje.nl/profielen/profiel.php?id=1072 |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> he was the most [[cap (football)|capped]] player in the history of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]], until [[Edwin van der Sar]] surpassed him. De Boer made his debut for the Netherlands in September 1990 against [[Italy national football team|Italy]].

De Boer also played for the Netherlands in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]] and [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s, and the [[UEFA Euro 1992|1992]], [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]] and [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]] [[UEFA European Championship]]s; he missed [[UEFA Euro 1996]] due to an injury.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.trouw.nl/voorpagina/frank-de-boer-wil-zichzelf-niet-in-de-maling-nemen~b718945f/ |title= Frank de Boer wil zichzelf niet in de maling nemen |trans-title= Frank de Boer doesn't want to fool himself |last= Buddenberg |first= Fred |date=5 June 1996 |website= Trouw |access-date=28 May 2024}}</ref> He is well-remembered for the arching 60-yard pass which allowed [[Dennis Bergkamp]] to score the last-minute goal that eliminated [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the quarter-finals of the 1998 World Cup.<ref>{{cite news |title=Oranje in 1998 voor het laatst in kwartfinale |url=http://www.gelderlander.nl/sport/wkvoetbal/6903024/Oranje-in-1998-voor-het-laatst-in-kwartfinale.ece |access-date=14 July 2010 |newspaper=[[De Gelderlander]] |date=28 June 2010}}</ref><ref>"Dutch defender Frank de Boer plays a sixty-metre pass, which finds a gap on the right side of the Argentina defence.

==Style of play==
A talented and well-rounded world-class defender, in addition to his defensive skills, De Boer also possessed technical ability, dead ball ability, accurate passing, and leadership, which enabled him to carry the ball out of defence, play it out from the back, or contribute to his team's offensive play by initiating attacks and creating chances for strikers with long balls. His weakness was his slow pace but his anticipation and reading of the game compensated for this. A versatile, intelligent, and elegant left-footed defender, with an ability to read the game and intercept loose balls, he was capable of playing both on the [[left-back|left]] and in the [[Centre-back|centre]], and was even deployed as a [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]]. He was also a dangerous [[Direct free kick|set-piece]] taker, renowned for his accurate [[Curl (football)|bending]] free kicks from anywhere around the penalty area.<ref name="98 FWC All-star team">{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/fifa-technical-study-group-designates-mastercard-all-star-team-71747 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612163711/https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/fifa-technical-study-group-designates-mastercard-all-star-team-71747 |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 June 2018 |title=FIFA Technical Study Group designates MasterCard All-Star Team |publisher=FIFA |date=10 July 1998 |access-date=13 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thescore.com/liga/news/1183292 |title=Launching pad: Ranking the 5 best Ajax products |work=The Score |author1=Jamie Johnstone |date=15 December 2016 |access-date=13 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/de-boers-join-barcelona-after-long-dispute-1.146778 |title=De Boers join Barcelona after long dispute |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=16 January 1999 |access-date=13 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11706/11028811/frank-de-boer-determined-to-finish-crystal-palace-project |title=Frank de Boer determined to finish Crystal Palace project |publisher=Sky Sports |author1=Greg Whelan |date=10 September 2017 |access-date=13 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/holland/squad/742218.stm |title=Frank de Boer |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=13 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/frank-de-boer-interview-if-you-pass-the-ball-you-have-to-do-it-with-a-message-not-here-is-the-ball-0bz7h76jk |title=Frank de Boer interview: If you pass the ball, you have to do it with a message – not, here is the ball |newspaper=The Times |author1=Henry Winter |date=8 July 2017 |access-date=13 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2206644-8-greatest-central-defenders-in-netherlands-history#slide7 |title=8 Greatest Central Defenders in Netherlands History |publisher=bleacherreport.com |author1=Elko Born |date=22 September 2014 |access-date=13 August 2018}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
In 2007, De Boer took up a coaching role at his former club Ajax where he was in charge of the club's youth sector. During the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], he was the assistant of the Netherlands national football team to manager [[Bert van Marwijk]], together with retired player [[Phillip Cocu]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Denken aan, maar nog niet dromen over 1998 |url=http://www.bndestem.nl/sport/wk2010/6900470/Denken-aan-maar-nog-niet-dromen-over-1998.ece |access-date=14 July 2010 |newspaper=[[BN/De Stem]] |date=28 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701170631/http://www.bndestem.nl/sport/wk2010/6900470/Denken-aan-maar-nog-niet-dromen-over-1998.ece |archive-date=1 July 2010}}</ref> The Dutch team reached the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|final of the tournament]], losing to [[Spain men's national football team|Spain]].

===Ajax===
[[File:Ebecilio De Boer (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|De Boer with Ajax in 2011]]
On 6 December 2010, after the resignation of [[Martin Jol]], De Boer was appointed [[caretaker manager]] of Ajax until the winter break. His first game in charge was a [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] match against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] at the [[San Siro]], a match Ajax won 2–0 through goals from [[Demy de Zeeuw]] and [[Toby Alderweireld]].<ref name="Caretaker" /> De Boer then went on to help Ajax become champions of the Eredivisie for the [[2010–11 Eredivisie|2010–11 season]] in a 3–1 home victory over [[FC Twente|Twente]], the champions of the [[2009–10 Eredivisie|previous year]], on the final matchday, making the first year of his professional coaching career a golden one. "I couldn't have wished for a more beautiful birthday present", said De Boer, as the club's 30th championship was won on his 41st birthday.<ref name="Birthdaypresent" />

In two-and-a-half years at the helm of Ajax, De Boer won three championships, making eight in total (when including the five that he won as a player). According to reports, De Boer was offered the chance to interview for the [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] job but turned it down to remain with Ajax. "I am honoured by the request [from Liverpool] but I have only just started with Ajax", he said.<ref name="independent" /> In 2013, De Boer received the [[Rinus Michels Award]] for manager of the year in the Netherlands after leading Ajax to their third successive Eredivisie title.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

On 27 April 2014, De Boer won his fourth successive Eredivisie title with Ajax, the first manager ever to achieve this in the Dutch league. Moreover, it marked the first time Ajax has ever won four successive Eredivisie titles. De Boer has now won a total of nine Eredivisie championships with Ajax as a player and manager, another record; [[Johan Cruyff]], [[Sjaak Swart]] and [[Jack Reynolds (footballer, born 1881)|Jack Reynolds]] all won eight Eredivisie championships with Ajax. Ajax finished the [[2014–15 Eredivisie]] in second position, a massive 17 points behind champions [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]].

On 11 May 2016, De Boer announced his resignation as manager of Ajax following a disappointing season when Ajax again lost out on the [[2015–16 Eredivisie|Eredivisie title]] to PSV on the final matchday of the season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ajaxshowtime.com/article/hoofdnieuws/96586/update-ajax-bevestigt-vertrek-de-boer |title=Ajax bevestigt vertrek De Boer |publisher=Ajax Showtime |date=12 May 2016 |access-date=12 May 2016 |archive-date=3 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603071939/http://www.ajaxshowtime.com/article/hoofdnieuws/96586/update-ajax-bevestigt-vertrek-de-boer |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Inter Milan===
On 9 August 2016, after the departure of [[Roberto Mancini]], De Boer signed a three-year contract with [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] for the start of the [[2016–17 Inter Milan season|2016–17 season]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37006620 |title=Inter Milan: Frank de Boer replaces Roberto Mancini as manager |publisher=BBC |date=8 August 2016 |access-date=8 August 2016|work=BBC Sport }}</ref> De Boer's first match in charge was Inter's final pre-season friendly, a 2–0 win against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] on 13 August, played on neutral ground at [[Thomond Park]], Republic of Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inter.it/en/news/54125/de-boer-begins-reign-with-win-over-celtic |title=De Boer begins reign with win over Celtic |date=13 August 2016 |access-date=3 November 2016 |publisher=F.C.

The club management board also approved expensive signings [[João Mário (footballer, born January 1993)|João Mário]] and [[Gabriel Barbosa]] for the team and De Boer (they were in fact linked to Mancini and Inter in July),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/inter-milan-boss-mancini-admits-admiration-for-joao-mario-gabigol-4137920 |title=Inter Milan boss Mancini admits admiration for Joao Mario, Gabigol |date=14 July 2016|access-date=17 November 2016 |publisher=tribalfootball.com}}</ref> and the return to Turkey of recent acquisition [[Caner Erkin]] in the last days of transfer window. Barbosa, however, was rarely used in [[Serie A]] matches and could not be registered in European competitions due to a penalty imposed on Inter for breaching [[UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations]] in previous seasons.
