A '''throw-in''' is a method of restarting play in [[association football]] as well as in the sport Cork Kick, when the whole ball passes over the touchline.  It is governed by Law 15 of [[Laws of the Game (association football)|the Laws of the Game]].<ref name="LOTG2020" /> In Scotland, it is known as a '''shy'''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Parliamo Scots? |url=http://www.rampantscotland.com/parliamo/blparliamo_double.htm |website=Rampant Scotland}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Murphy |first=Sean |date=2021-02-19 |title=10 words you'll only hear in Scotland after Scots presenter baffles English colleague with 'squint' |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/scotland-now/10-words-youll-only-hear-23530114 |access-date=2023-01-10}}</ref>

==Award==
When the ball goes [[Ball in and out of play|out of play]] past the touch-line to the side of the pitch, a throw-in is awarded to the opponents of the player who last touched the ball, whether deliberately or accidentally.<ref name="LOTG2020" />

==Procedure==
The throw-in is taken from the point where the ball crossed the [[touch-line]], either on the ground or in the air, though typically a referee will tolerate small discrepancies between the position where the ball crossed the touch-line and the position of the throw-in.<ref name="LOTG2020" >{{cite journal  |url=https://www.fifplay.com/downloads/documents/laws-of-the-game-2019-2020.pdf
 |title=Laws of the Game 2019/2020 |journal=Laws of the Game |date=1 June 2019 |publisher=IFAB  |access-date=27 August 2019 |quote=Law 15, The Throw In|pages=126–128 }}</ref> Opposing players may not approach closer than {{convert|2|m|yd|abbr=on}} to the point on the touch-line from which the throw-in is to be taken.

When delivering the ball, the thrower must face the field of play. The thrower must have part of each foot on the touch-line or the ground outside the touch-line<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/laws/football-11-11/law-15---the-throw-in.aspx|title=The website for the English football association, the Emirates FA Cup and the England football team|first=The Football|last=Association|website=thefa.com}}</ref> and use both hands to deliver the ball from behind and over the head.

The ball becomes in play as soon as it enters the field.

A [[Scoring in association football|goal]] cannot be scored directly from a throw-in; if a player throws the ball directly into their own goal without any other player touching it, the result is a [[corner kick]] to the opposing side.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/footballdevelopment/technicalsupport/refereeing/laws-of-the-game/law/newsid=1290875.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008220445/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/footballdevelopment/technicalsupport/refereeing/laws-of-the-game/law/newsid=1290875.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 October 2012|title=Education & Technical - Referees - Laws of the Game |publisher=FIFA}}</ref> Likewise, an offensive goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in; the result, in this case, is a goal kick for the defending team.

A player may not be penalised for an offside offence when receiving the ball directly from a throw-in.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110312104212/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame/law/newsid=1290867.html FIFA.com]</ref> Skillful attackers can sometimes take advantage of this rule by getting behind the last defender(s) to receive the throw-in and having a clear path to the goal.

The optimal release angle for attaining maximum distance is about 30 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] above the horizontal, according to researchers at [[Brunel University]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Release angle for attaining maximum distance in the soccer throw-in|first1=Nicholas P.|last1=Linthorne|first2=David J.|last2=Everett|journal=Sports Biomechanics|date=19 January 2006|volume=5|issue=2|pages=243–60|doi=10.1080/14763140608522877|pmid=16939156|arxiv=physics/0601149|bibcode=2006physics...1149L|s2cid=16406503}}</ref> According to the study, players can throw the ball with greater release velocity for lower angles. The optimal angle would be 45 degrees if the release velocity did not depend on the angle of throw, if the ball were thrown from ground level instead of above the head, and if there was no air drag.

==Offences==
[[File:Stefan Nigro Port Melbourne August 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Stefan Nigro]] takes a throw-in for [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]]]]
Opposing players failing to respect the required distance (2 m) before the ball is in play, or otherwise unfairly distract or impede the thrower, may receive a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|caution]] (yellow card) for unsporting behaviour. If the throw-in has already been taken when the referee stops play for this offence, an [[indirect free kick]] is awarded.

If the thrower fails to deliver the ball per the required procedure or from a point other than where the ball left the field of play, the throw-in is awarded to the opposing team. This is commonly known as a "foul throw".<ref name=Foulthrow>{{cite web|url=http://asktheref.com/Soccer+Rules/Question/14826/|title=Soccer Rules Q&A Search AskTheref.com|website=asktheref.com}}</ref> However, if the ball touches the ground before entering the field (but it was taken correctly), the same team retakes the throw-in from the same position.

It is an infringement for the thrower to touch the ball a second time before another player has touched it; this is punishable by an [[indirect free kick]] to the opposing team from where the offence occurred, unless the second touch was also a more serious handling offence, in which case it is punishable by a [[direct free kick]] or [[penalty kick (football)|penalty kick]].

If a player appears to take a throw-in but suddenly leaves it to a teammate to take, the player may be cautioned for delaying the restart of play.<ref name=delay>{{cite web |url=http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/793/103202_200519_LotG_201920_EN_SinglePage.pdf |page=110 |title=Laws of the Game 2019/20 |year=2019 |access-date=2019-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603034707/http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/793/103202_200519_LotG_201920_EN_SinglePage.pdf |archive-date=2019-06-03 |url-status=live }}</ref> Any player who excessively delays the restart of play may also be cautioned.<ref name=delay />

A goalkeeper cannot handle a ball thrown directly by a teammate. The keeper cannot circumvent this by using the feet before handling the ball. An indirect free kick is awarded if this infringement occurs within the goalkeeper's penalty area, and a direct free kick is awarded if the infringement occurs outside the goalkeeper's penalty area.

==History==

===Before 1863===
[[File:Touch Standing Up (Harcourt Chambers, 1845).jpg|thumb|Illustration of the line-out used at Rugby School (1845)]]

A detailed description of an early predecessor of the throw-in is recorded in the novel ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'', published in 1857 but based on the author's experiences at [[Rugby School]] from 1834 to 1842:<ref>{{cite book |author= "An Old Boy" [Thomas Hughes] |year=1857 |publisher=Macmillan |location=Cambridge |title=Tom Brown's School Days |pages=109, 118 |url=https://archive.org/stream/tombrownsschool00cogoog#page/n124 }}</ref> {{blockquote|You see this gravel walk running down all along this side of the playing-ground, and the line of elms opposite on the other? Well, they're the bounds. As soon as the ball gets past them, it's in touch and out of play. And then whoever first touches it has to knock it straight out amongst the players-up, who make two lines with a space between them, every fellow going on his side ... He stands with the ball in his hand, while the two sides form in deep lines opposite one another: he must strike it straight out between them.}}

Several features of these passages are notable:
* possession is awarded to the first player to touch the ball after it goes out of play (this is the origin of the term "touch" for the area beyond the field of play)
* the ball must be played "straight out" (i.e. perpendicular to the touch-line)
* the player must "knock" or "strike" the ball back into play
The 1851 rules of Rugby School describe a similar procedure, except that the ball is thrown in rather than struck or hit; this is the ancestor of the [[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]] in [[rugby union]]:<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of Football as played at Rugby School (1851)}}</ref> 

{{blockquote|
A ball in touch is dead; consequently, the first player on his side must touch it down, bring it to the edge of touch, and throw it straight out. }}

Similar "throw-in" laws are found in the [[Cambridge rules]] of 1856,<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Cambridge Rules (1856) |quote=The ball is out when it has passed the line of the flag posts on either side of the ground, in which case it shall be thrown in straight.}}</ref> the [[Sheffield rules]] of 1858,<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Sheffield rules (1858) |quote=A Ball in touch is dead, consequently the side that touches it down must bring it to the edge of the touch, and throw it straight out at least six yards from touch.}}</ref> the laws of [[Melbourne FC]] (1859),<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Rules of Melbourne Football Club (1859) |quote=When a Ball goes out of bounds (the same being indicated by a row of posts) it shall be brought back to the point where it crossed the boundary-line, and thrown in at right angles with that line}}</ref> and indeed the original FA laws of 1863 (see below).

Other codes had a kick-in rather than a throw-in.  These included the "Foot-Ball Club" of Edinburgh (1833),<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Rules of The Foot-Ball Club (1833) |quote=A free-kick if ball out of bounds}}</ref> [[Harrow football]] (1858),<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Rules of Harrow Football (1858) |quote=If the Ball is kicked beyond the prescribed limits of the Ground, it must be kicked straight in again; and then must not be touched by the Hands, or Arms below the Elbow}}</ref> [[Barnes FC]] (1862),<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Rules of Barnes Football Club (1862) |quote=If the ball is kicked out of the ground (to be fixed before commencing the game) it is dead, and the first player who can pick it up shall bring it to the point where it left the ground, and be entitled to kick it as he thinks fit}}</ref> [[Blackheath FC]] (1862),<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Rules of Blackheath Football Club (1862) |quote=A ball in touch is dead, and the first player who touches it down must kick it out straight from the place where it entered touch.}}</ref> and the later Cambridge rules from November 1863.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Cambridge Rules (1863) |quote=When the ball goes out of the ground by crossing the side lines, it is out of play, and shall be kicked straight into the ground again from the point where it is first stopped.}}</ref> Some of these laws permitted the ball to be kicked in any direction, while others required that it be perpendicular to the touch-line.  At Harrow, the ball could be kicked in by "any bystanders" or player.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Field |date=1863-11-21 |page=499 |first=John D. |last=Cartwright |title=The Harrow Game, The Charter-House Rules, and the Winchester Goals |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Harrow_Game_The_Charter-House_Rules,_and_the_Winchester_Goals_(The_Field)_1863-11-21.png#%7B%7Bint%3Afiledesc%7D%7D}}</ref>

The [[Eton field game]]'s rules, as recorded in 1847, specified that a throw-in and a "bully" (scrummage) should be used alternately,<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Eton Field Game (1847) |quote=When the Ball is dead, it must be thrown in, or a bully formed parallel to the place where it stopped: these are to take place alternately}}</ref> while its 1857 rules used the bully exclusively.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Eton Field Game (1857) |quote=When the ball is dead, a bully must be formed opposite to the spot where it stopped}}</ref>

===The FA laws of 1863===

At its second meeting, on 10 November 1863, the [[Football Association]] agreed that "when the ball is [[out of bounds]] it should be kicked or thrown in straight by the person who should first touch it down."<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1863) (initial resolutions)}}</ref> The first draft of the game's laws reflected this decision,<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1863) (draft) |quote=When the ball is in touch the first player who touches it shall kick or throw it from the point on the boundary line where it left the ground, in a direction at right angles with the boundary line.}}</ref> but the option of a kick-in was removed before the final version of the laws was adopted on 8 December 1863.

This left the 1863 throw-in law very similar to those of Rugby School and Sheffield described earlier:<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1863)}}</ref> 

{{blockquote|When the ball is in touch, the first player who touches it shall throw it from the point on the boundary line where it left the ground, in a direction at right angles with the boundary line.}}

The throw-in from the 1863 rules features several differences from the throw-in in modern association football:
* possession is awarded to the first player to touch the ball ''after'' it goes out of play (in the modern game, it is awarded against the team last touching the ball ''before'' it goes out of play)
* the ball must be thrown perpendicular to the touch-line (in the modern game, the ball may be thrown in any direction)
* the manner in which the ball is thrown is not specified (in the modern game, the ball must be thrown with two hands from above the head)

===Subsequent developments===
====Unity with Sheffield rules====
In 1867, the laws of the [[Sheffield Football Association]] awarded the throw-in against the team kicking the ball out of play.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Sheffield Rules (March 1867) |quote=When the ball is in touch, a player of the opposite side to that which has kicked it out shall throw it from the point on the boundary line where it left the ground}}</ref> In 1868, these [[Sheffield rules]] were revised to award a kick-in instead of a throw-in.  It continued to be awarded against the team that kicked the ball into touch and could now be played in any direction.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Sheffield Rules (1868) |quote=When the ball is in touch, a player of the opposite side to that which kicked it out shall kick it in from where it went out; and no player be allowed within six yards of the ball, until kicked.}}</ref>

In 1873, [[Nottingham Forest F.C.]] proposed a change in the FA's throw-in law to make it more similar to the Sheffield rule:  the throw-in would be awarded against the team who kicked out of play, and a kick-in could optionally replace it.   The FA's meeting approved only part of the suggested change:  the throw-in would be awarded against the team that kicked the ball out of play, but a kick-in could not replace it.  It was still required to be thrown perpendicular to the touch-line.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1873)}}</ref>

At the FA meetings of 1875 and 1876, the Sheffield clubs attempted to introduce their kick-in into the FA's laws.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1875)}}</ref><ref name="fa_1877">{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1877)}}</ref> Both times, the change was narrowly rejected after a heated debate.  Matters came to a head in 1877. At the regular meeting of the FA, in February, the Sheffield Association again proposed its kick-in rule, while [[Clydesdale FC]] proposed a compromise rule which retained the throw-in but allowed it to go in any direction. The Sheffield Association agreed to withdraw its proposal in favour of Clydesdale FC's compromise. However, even this compromise proposal was rejected, "to the intense regret of those who desired one common code of rules."<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Football Association |journal= Nottinghamshire Guardian |issue=1649 |page=7 |date=1877-03-02 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Football_Association_(Notts_Guardian)_1877-03-02.png}}</ref> This rejection prompted the publication of a pseudonymous letter in ''[[The Sportsman (1865 newspaper)|The Sportsman]]'' decrying the "hasty, ill-judged decision ... bringing the Football Association into disrepute," and denying that it represented "the general body of [Football] Association players – even of those in London."<ref>{{cite journal |author=White Surrey |title=The Football Association Meeting [letter to the editor] |journal=The Sportsman  |issue=2323 |page=4 |date=1877-03-02 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Football_Association_Meeting_(Sportsman)_1877-03-02.png}}</ref> A subsequent extraordinary general meeting of the FA was held on 17 April, at which the Clydesdale amendment was reconsidered and passed.<ref name="fa_1877"/> As a result of this change in the FA laws, the Sheffield Association held a meeting one week later at which it agreed to abandon its own rules and accept the FA laws.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Meeting_of_the_Sheffield_Football_Association_(Sheffield_Independent)_1877_04_24.png |title=Meeting of the Sheffield Football Association |journal=Sheffield and Rotherham Independent |volume=lxi |issue=5722 |date=1877-04-24 |page=7}}</ref>

As a result of these developments, the throw-in of 1877 looked quite similar to today's: it was awarded against the team who kicked the ball out of play, and it could be thrown in any direction.  There was no restriction on the technique by which the ball could be thrown; players would throw the ball great distances using only one arm. It is reported that the England international [[Norman Bailey (footballer)|Norman Bailey]] could propel the ball "from the centre of the ground into the goal mouth."<ref>{{cite journal| author=Lancastrian |title=The Football Association Conference |journal= Athletic News and Cyclist's Journal |volume=vii |issue=38.3 |page=5 |date=1882-12-13 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Association_Football_Conference_(Athletic_News)_1882-12-13.png}}</ref>

====Unity with Scotland====

The [[International Football Conference]] of December 1882 addressed discrepancies between the laws used by the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish football associations.<ref>{{cite journal |title=National Football Conference in Manchester |journal= Glasgow Herald |volume= 100 |issue=292 |page=5 |date=1882-12-07 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:National_Football_Conference_In_Manchester_(Glasgow_Herald)_1887-12-07.png }}</ref> One of the topics settled at this conference was the throw-in:  in April 1882, at the proposal of [[Third Lanark A.C.|the Third Lanark club]], the Scottish FA changed its rugby-style throw-in law (i.e. one-handed, perpendicular to the touchline) to the version in use today, i.e. thrown in any direction, but with two hands over the head;<ref>{{cite journal |title=Scottish Football Association |journal=Glasgow Herald |date=27 April 1882 |page=6}}</ref> while the English laws, as described above, allowed the ball to be thrown with one hand in any direction.  As a result of the conference, the Scottish version of the throw-in law was accepted.  This new throw-in law, requiring the ball to be thrown from over the head with two hands, was formally adopted by the FA in 1883.<ref name="fa_1883">{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1883)}}</ref>

====Scoring a goal from a throw-in====

The game's laws have never permitted a goal to be scored directly from a throw-in by the attacking team.<ref>e.g. {{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1863) |quote=A goal shall be won when the ball passes between the goal posts or over the space between the goal posts (at whatever height), '''not being thrown''', knocked on, or carried.}}</ref> In 1882, a change in the laws, introduced by [[Nicholas Lane Jackson]] of [[Finchley F.C.|Finchley FC]] and [[Morton Betts]] of [[Harrow Chequers F.C.|Old Harrovians FC]], made it possible to score an [[own goal]] directly from a throw-in.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1882) |quote=A goal shall be won when the ball has passed between the goal-posts under the tape or bar, not being thrown, knocked on nor carried '''by anyone of the attacking side'''}}</ref> This possibility was removed in 1898.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1898) |quote=A goal shall not be scored from a throw in}}</ref>

In 2002, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] goalkeeper [[Peter Enckelman]] scored an own goal from a team-mate's throw-back to him when he misscontrolled the ball, but appeared to touch it slightly with his foot before it crossed the line, though Enkelman denied this.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2254800.stm |title=Blues humiliate Villa |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=16 September 2002 |access-date=11 January 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/2263802.stm |title=Enckelman denies crucial touch |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 September 2002 |access-date=11 January 2021}}</ref> The incident received widespread media attention because it occurred in an important [[Birmingham derby]] match in the [[Premier League]].<ref>[https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-birmingham-city-enckleman-12917403 Aston Villa vs Birmingham City: Peter Enckelman discusses his infamous blunder], Birmingham Mail, 16 November 2018</ref>

====Offside from a throw-in====

Under the original laws of 1863, it was not possible to be offside from a throw-in;<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1863) |quote=When a player has '''kicked''' the ball any one of the same side who is nearer to the opponent's goal line is out of play}}</ref> however, since the ball was required to be thrown in at right angles to the touch-line, it would have been unusual for a player to gain significant advantage from being ahead of the ball.  After the ball was permitted to be thrown in any direction in 1877, the following year (1878), a new law was introduced to allow a player offside from a throw-in.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1878) |quote=When a player kicks the ball, '''or it is thrown in from touch''', any one of the same side who at such moment of kicking or throwing is nearer to the opponents' goal-line, is out of play}}</ref> This situation lasted until 1920, when the law was altered to prevent a player from being offside from a throw-in.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1920min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1920 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |page=4 |access-date=2018-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Off Side Law Unaltered |page=2 |date=1920-06-14 |journal=Lincolnshire Echo |issue=8827}}</ref>

====Position of thrower's feet====
In 1895, the thrower was required to "stand on the touch line."<ref name="laws_1895"/> In 1896, it was clarified that the thrower could have "any part of both feet on the [touch] line."<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1896)}}</ref> In 1925, this was changed to "both feet on the ground ''outside'' the touch-line,"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1925min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1925 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |access-date=2020-01-14 |page=4}}</ref> but in 1932 it reverted to "both feet ''on or outside'' the touch-line."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1932min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1932 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |access-date=2020-01-14 |page=3}}</ref> In 1937, the requirement was again changed to "part of each foot shall be either on or outside the touchline."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1937min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1937 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |access-date=2020-01-14 |page=4}}</ref> In 1960, the wording was further refined to "part of each foot shall be either on the touch-line or on the ground outside the touch-line."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1960min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1960 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |access-date=2020-01-14 |at=p. 3 [p. 4 of the PDF]}}</ref>

====Manner of throwing====
In 1895, the player taking the throw-in was required to face the field of play.<ref name="laws_1895">{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1895) |quote=The player throwing the ball must stand on the touch line facing the field of play}}</ref> In 1965, the ball was required to be thrown from "behind and over" the head of the thrower.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1965min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1965 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |access-date=2019-12-26 |at=p. 5 [p. 10 of PDF]}}</ref>

====Position of opponents====
Since 2005, opponents have been forbidden from approaching closer than 2 metres to the player taking the throw-in.  This change was made because FIFA perceived "an increasing trend for an opponent to stand immediately in front of the thrower at a throw-in, with his feet virtually on the touch-line," with the result that "the thrower is being impeded from completing the throw-in."  There was also a concern about the possibility of "a confrontational situation developing between both players."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/2005amen.pdf |title=FIFA Circular: Amendments To The Laws of the Game – 2005 |page=6 |access-date=2018-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/the-laws/2001-2006.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202210639/http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/the-laws/2001-2006.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 February 2016 |title=The History of the Laws of the Game – 2001–2006 |access-date=2018-09-20}}</ref>

====Double touch====
Since 1866, the player taking the throw-in has been forbidden to touch the ball again until another player has touched it.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1866) |quote=[T]he player throwing it in shall not play it until it has been played by another player}}</ref>

====Defunct requirements====

In 1866, players were forbidden from playing the ball before it had touched the ground.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1866) |quote=When the ball is in touch, the first player who touches it shall throw it from the point on the boundary line where it left the ground, in a direction at right angles with the boundary line, '''and it shall not be in play until it has touched the ground'''}}</ref><ref>There is some evidence that this requirement was also in the original 1863 laws.  See {{cite book |first=Tony |last=Brown |title=The Football Association 1863–1883: A Source Book |location=Nottingham |publisher=Soccerdata |isbn=9781905891528 |year=2011 |page=20}}</ref> This requirement was removed when the Clydesdale throw-in law was adopted in 1877.<ref name="fa_1877"/>

In 1871, a law change introduced by [[Wanderers FC]] forbade players from playing the ball until it had travelled at least six yards.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1871) |quote=When the ball is in touch, the first player who touches it shall throw it from the point on the boundary line where it left the ground, in a direction at right angles with the boundary line, '''to a distance of at least six yards'''}}</ref> This requirement was dropped when the Scottish throw-in law was adopted in 1883.<ref name="fa_1883"/>

====Punishment for violations of the throw-in law====
In 1882, an indirect free-kick was awarded for any violation of the throw-in law.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1882) |quote=In the event of any infringement of Rules '''5''', 6, 8, or 9, 12, or 14, a free kick shall be forfeited to the opposite side from the spot where the infringement took place.}}</ref> In 1931, on a proposal by the [[Irish Football Association]], this was changed to an award of the throw-in to the opposing team (except for a violation of the double-touch rule, which remained punishable by an indirect free-kick).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Football |page=3 |date=1931-06-19 |journal=Carluke and Lanark Gazette}}</ref>

In 1966, it was specified that opponents who "dance about or gesticulate in a way calculated to distract or impede the thrower" should be cautioned for ungentlemanly conduct.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1966min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1966 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |access-date=2020-01-14 |at=p. 14 [p. 12 of PDF]}}</ref> In 1997, this wording was updated to punish with a yellow card an opponent who "unfairly distracts or impedes the thrower" for "unsporting behaviour."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1997min.pdf |title=Laws of the Game (1997) |access-date=2020-01-14 |at=p. 33 [p. 138 of PDF]}}</ref> In 2016, the same punishment was applied to an opponent who approached closer than the minimum 2 metre distance; it was further specified that an indirect free-kick must be awarded if the ball was thrown in when the referee stops play to deal with the offence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/60/Laws%20of%20the%20Game_16-17_Digital_Eng.pdf |title=Laws of the Game 2016/17 |access-date=2020-01-14 |page=100 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911032912/http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/60/Laws%20of%20the%20Game_16-17_Digital_Eng.pdf |archive-date=2016-09-11 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Name====
The name "throw-in" is first found in the laws of 1891.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1891) |quote=Two linesmen shall be appointed, whose duty (SUBJECT TO THE DECISION OF THE REFEREE) shall be to decide when the ball is out of play, and which side is entitled to the corner-flag kick, goal-kick, or throw in.}}</ref>

===Flip throws===
[[File:Michele Weissenhofer flip throw at 2006 NCAAW Tournament final.jpg|thumb|right|Michele Weissenhofer, a forward for [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's soccer]] player attempting a flip throw]]
An uncommon but effective technique for delivering a faster than usual throw is the '''flip throw''' (notably employed in recent years by, among others, Estonian player [[Risto Kallaste]], and Icelander [[Steinþór Freyr Þorsteinsson]]): in it the player, during the run-up, plants the ball on the ground, flips over it and uses the momentum gained from the flip to increase the velocity of the ball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.active.com/soccer/articles/the-art-of-the-flip-throw|title=The Art of the Flip Throw|date=1 September 2011}}</ref> American flip thrower Michael Lewis set a new ''[[Guinness World Record]]'' when he recorded a throw-in of {{Convert|59.817|m|yd|abbr=on}} in [[Frisco, Texas]], in April 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-throw-in-(football) |title=Farthest distance football (soccer) throw-in (male) |website=Guinness World Records |date=21 April 2019 |access-date=5 October 2020}}</ref><ref name="Guardian 20200129">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/29/which-footballer-holds-the-world-record-for-the-longest-throw-in |title=Which footballer holds the world record for the longest throw-in? |work=The Guardian |date=29 January 2020 |access-date=5 October 2020}}</ref> British footballers [[Dave Challinor]] and [[Andy Legg]] are among the previous record holders.<ref name="Guardian 20200129" /> Iranian defender [[Milad Mohammadi]] made a failed attempt at a flip throw in the group-stage match against Spain at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]];<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/06/20/iran-player-throw-fail-flip-video-spain-world-cup | title=WATCH: Iran player fails on front-flip throw-in try | date=20 June 2018 }}</ref> two years later, compatriot [[Nader Mohammadi]] scored using the technique in a domestic match (the goalkeeper touched the ball on its way in).<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/55239103 Player scores with somersault throw in Persian League], BBC Sport, 8 December 2020</ref>

=== Cork Kick Throw Ins ===
Throw-ins in Cork Kick are different because of one key factor. In Cork Kick once the Cork is thrown back into play, it can be slapped at the other team's goal as long as it hasn't touched the ground. It can also just be dropped at the feet and kicked at the other teams goal. This make the game a lot more balanced, providing different ways to play in many situations.
