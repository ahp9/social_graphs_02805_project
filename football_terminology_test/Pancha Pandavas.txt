Thangaraj scored once for East Bengal as they managed a draw against the [[1952 Soviet Cup]] champions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rsssf.org/tabless/su52.html|title=Soviet Union Cup 1952|work=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=28 August 2021|archive-date=19 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210519105528/http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/su52.html#52c|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the team was fatigued because of the long tour. The players could not cope with the extreme Russian climate, and the tour took a toll on them as they lost the next three games: 9–1 against [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] at [[Tbilisi]], 6–0 against [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]] in Moscow and 13–1 against [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] at [[Kyiv]] before the team returned to India.<ref name="ppgoal" /><ref name="EBHistory"/><ref name=fakhri/>
