A '''nutmeg''', also known by dozens of national and regional variations, is a skill used mainly in [[association football]], but also in [[field hockey]], [[ice hockey]], and [[basketball]]. The aim is to kick, roll, dribble, throw, or push the [[ball]] (or puck) between an opponent's legs (feet). This might be done to pass or when shooting the ball, but a nutmeg is more commonly associated with the skill of dribbling where it enables a player to get behind a defender.

Kicking the ball through an opponent's legs in order to get the ball past them and back to the original player is a [[dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skill that is commonly used among football players. Owing to its effectiveness and being visually impressive, it is very popular among players and can be frequently seen being attempted multiple times throughout a game, whether by a single player or many different players. Some of the most notable practitioners include [[Juan Román Riquelme|Riquelme]], [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], [[Ronaldinho]], [[Robinho]], [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Neymar]], [[Luis Suárez]], [[Lionel Messi]], and [[Eden Hazard]]. <ref name=collins /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11945/9807385/watch-luis-suarez-nutmegs-david-luiz-twice-in-barcelonas-win-at-psg|title=WATCH: Luis Suarez nutmeg David Luiz twice in Barcelona's win at PSG|agency=Sky Sports|date=16 April 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527190240/http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11945/9807385/watch-luis-suarez-nutmegs-david-luiz-twice-in-barcelonas-win-at-psg|archive-date=27 May 2015}}</ref> Suárez in particular is known for having a penchant for executing it constantly, which led to the banner and saying "Suárez can nutmeg a Mermaid" during his time at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].<ref>[http://www.savile-rogue.com/blog/2014/01/liverpools-excellent-luis-suarez-could-nutmeg-a-mermaid-banner/ "Liverpool fans coming up with the 'Suarez could nutmeg a Mermaid' banners."] Savile Rogue.

=== Street football game ===
There is also a [[Street football (association football)|street football]] game, originating in the Netherlands, which is called ''panna'' ([[Sranan Tongo]] for ''gate''). This game depends on usage of this technique.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/sport/article6405076.ece |title = Nye street-spil indtog Aarhus| date=15 January 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://cado.dk/reference/moelleparken/ |title = Mølleparken {{!}} CADO}}</ref>

In France and other french-speaking regions, children, (mainly boys) sometimes play a game called [[:fr:Petit pont massacreur|petit pont massacreur]] or "petit pont-baston" ("small bridge massacre" and "small bridge fight" in French, but equivalent to nutmeg slaughter and nutmeg rumble in English or string-a-kick in Jamaica).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2008-12-03 |title=Le «petit pont massacreur»fait une nouvelle victime |url=https://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2008/12/03/01016-20081203ARTFIG00621-le-petit-pont-massacreur-fait-une-nouvelle-victime-.php |access-date=2025-11-19 |website=Le Figaro |language=fr}}</ref> During this game, any player that gets a nutmeg becomes the target of all other players, who are then allowed to kick the player, until he touches a predefinite object in the game area. The violence of this game got it to be highly mediatised during the 2000s, after children were hospitalized because of it. This is similar to a game played by children in the UK called "nutmeg rush", and a game played in the Netherlands called "Panna Knockout"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Urban Dictionary: Nutmeg Rush |url=https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nutmeg+Rush |access-date=2025-11-19 |website=Urban Dictionary |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Panna Knock Out |url=https://jeugdfondssportencultuur.nl/en/panna-knockout/ |access-date=2025-11-19 |website=Youth Fund Sports & Culture |language=en-GB}}</ref>.

== Etymology ==
An early use of the term is in the novel ''A bad lot'' by [[Brian Glanville]] (1977).<ref name=bailey /> According to Alex Leith's book ''Over the Moon, Brian - The Language of Football'', "nuts refers to the [[testicle]]s of the player through whose legs the ball has been passed and nutmeg is just a development from this".<ref name=leith /> The use of the word nutmeg to mean leg, in [[Rhyming slang|Cockney rhyming slang]], has also been put forward as an explanation.<ref name="guardian-theknowledge" />

Another theory, supported by the OED, was postulated by Peter Seddon in his book, ''Football Talk - The Language And Folklore Of The World's Greatest Game''.<ref name=seddon /> The word, he suggests, arose because of a sharp practice used in [[nutmeg]] exports in the 19th century between North America and England. "Nutmegs were such a valuable commodity that unscrupulous exporters were to pull a fast one by mixing a helping of wooden replicas into the sacks being shipped to England," writes Seddon. "Being nutmegged soon came to imply stupidity on the part of the duped victim and cleverness on the part of the trickster." While such a ploy would surely not be able to be employed more than once, Seddon alleges it soon caught on in football, implying that the player whose legs the ball had been played through had been tricked, or, nutmegged.<ref name="guardian-theknowledge" />

== In other sports ==
In the National Basketball Association, [[Manu Ginóbili]] and [[Jamaal Tinsley]] employ the pass between the legs variant.{{original research inline|date=March 2018}} Some commentators also use the term "[[five-hole]]" when this happens; the term arose in [[ice hockey]] for when the puck passes between the goalie's legs into the goal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.startribune.com/official-hockey-lingo-merriam-webster-adds-five-hole-to-the-dictionary/413186373/ | title=Official hockey lingo: Merriam-Webster adds 'five-hole' to the dictionary | website=[[Star Tribune]] | date=8 February 2017 }}</ref><ref name=5hole />

In cricket, England's [[Nat Sciver]] had the "Natmeg" shot named after her,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/94680050/white-ferns-tormentor-credited-with-inventing-the-natmeg-cricket-shot |title=White Ferns' tormentor Natalie Sciver credited with inventing 'Natmeg' cricket shot |work=Stuff |date=12 July 2017 |access-date=22 September 2020}}</ref> when she hit a cricket ball through her legs during a game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/437634 |title='Natmeg' in her range, Sciver goes from strength to strength |work=International Cricket Council |access-date=22 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/31996/10945906/the-nat-meg-natalie-scivers-inventive-shot-against-the-yorker |title=The 'Nat-meg': Natalie Sciver's inventive shot against the yorker |work=Sky Sports |access-date=22 September 2020}}</ref>

In cricket, if ball goes through the legs of a fielder, in [[Kashmiri language]] it's said to be a taharat of the fielder. Taharat is the equivalent of [[Istinja]].
