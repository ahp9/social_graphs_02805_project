A '''soccer-specific stadium''', mainly in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Sakiewicz |first=Edward Paul |year=2006 |title=A Comparative Study of Enterprise Risk Management and Decision Making Criteria Used in Developing Soccer-specific Stadiums for Major League Soccer |chapter=Chapter I: Introduction |page=24 |publisher=Capella University |isbn=9780542914812 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0finZwj9-LYC |via=[[Google Books]] |access-date=August 1, 2015}}</ref> is a sports stadium either purpose-built or fundamentally redesigned for [[soccer]] and whose primary function is to host soccer matches, as opposed to a [[multi-purpose stadium]] which is for a variety of sports. A soccer-specific stadium may host other sporting events (such as [[lacrosse]], [[American football]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]]) and concerts, but the design and purpose of a soccer-specific stadium is primarily for soccer. Some facilities (for example [[SeatGeek Stadium]], [[Toyota Stadium (Texas)|Toyota Stadium]] and [[Historic Crew Stadium]]) have a permanent stage at one end of the stadium used for staging concerts.

A soccer-specific stadium typically has amenities, dimensions and scale suitable for soccer in North America, including a scoreboard, video screen, luxury suites and possibly a roof. The field dimensions are within the range found optimal by [[FIFA]]: {{convert|110|–|120|yd|m}} long by {{convert|64|–|75|m|yd|-1|order=flip}} wide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame%5f2010%5f11%5fe.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704211500/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 4, 2010 |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |publisher=FIFA |page=7 |access-date=October 9, 2010}} Although the official [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] allow for pitches in adult matches to be {{convert|90|-|120|m|yd|-1|order=flip}} long by {{convert|45|-|90|m|yd|-1|order=flip}} wide. The more restrictive range is specified for international matches like the ones used in the [[FIFA World Cup]].</ref> These soccer field dimensions are wider than the regulation [[American football]] field width of {{convert|53+1/3|yd|m}}, or the {{convert|65|yd|m|adj=on}} width of a [[Canadian football]] field. The playing surface typically consists of [[grass]] as opposed to [[artificial turf]], as the latter is generally disfavored for soccer matches since players are more susceptible to injuries.<ref>{{cite web|date=September 10, 2014|url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/uswnt-stars-not-backing-down-on-stance-artificial-playing-surface-2015-women's-world-cup-091014|title=USWNT stars not backing down on artificial playing surface stance|author=Fox Sports|work=FOX Sports|access-date=October 9, 2014}}</ref> However, some soccer-specific stadiums, such as Portland's [[Providence Park]] and Creighton University's [[Morrison Stadium]], do have artificial turf.

This is in comparison to the much larger American football stadiums that mostly range between 60,000 and 80,000 in which the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|original North American Soccer League]] teams played and most MLS teams occupied during the league's inception.<ref>{{cite news |date=May 12, 2012 |title=M.L.S.

==History==
[[File:Mapfre_Stadium_(Columbus,_Ohio)_-_aerial_photo.jpg|thumb|Columbus Crew Stadium (now [[Historic Crew Stadium]]) was the first soccer-specific stadium in MLS.]]
In the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, first-division professional soccer leagues in the United States, such as the North American Soccer League and Major League Soccer, primarily used [[American football]] fields, many of which were oversized in terms of seating capacity and undersized in terms of the width of the soccer field; they often used [[artificial turf]] (none of which, at the time, were approved for international soccer under FIFA rules).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Although many of the [[baseball park]]s had smaller capacities, natural grass, and a wider field, these parks were generally in use during summer, when North American–based soccer leagues, such as Major League Soccer, also hold their seasons, and the irregular field dimensions and sightlines were often considered undesirable.

Soccer-specific stadiums first came into use in the 1990s, after the [[multi-purpose stadium]] era.<ref name="dispatch1">{{cite news |last=Arace |first=Michael |date=September 10, 2013 |title=Michael Arace commentary: Aging Crew Stadium still has a big advantage |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/sports/2013/09/10/aging-crew-stadium-still-has-a-bigadvantage.html |newspaper=[[The Columbus Dispatch]] |access-date=August 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Granillo |first=Larry |date=September 14, 2009 |title=Football, Baseball, and the Era of the "Superstadium" |url=http://wezen-ball.com/2009-articles/football-baseball-and-the-era-of-the-qsuperstadiumq.html |work=Wezen-Ball |access-date=August 1, 2015}}</ref>

The term "soccer-specific stadium" was coined by [[Lamar Hunt]], who financed the construction of [[Columbus Crew Stadium]], the first soccer-specific stadium constructed specifically for Major League Soccer.<ref name="dispatch1"/> In the 2000s, other Major League Soccer teams in the United States began constructing their own stadiums. Canada's first soccer-specific stadium was [[BMO Field]] in [[Toronto]], home to [[Toronto FC]]. This stadium was renovated to accommodate [[Canadian football]] for the 2016 and subsequent seasons.<ref>{{cite web |title=BMO Field |date=August 2, 2013 |url=http://www.stadiumguide.com/bmofield/ |publisher=The Stadium Guide |access-date=August 1, 2015}}</ref> The distinction is less prominent in Canada, where MLS's attendance figures are comparable to those of the domestic [[Canadian Football League]], and the CFL's wider field means fewer compromises must be made to accommodate both; [[Tim Hortons Field]] was built purposely to both soccer specifications and CFL regulations. Of the three Canadian cities that host both MLS and CFL teams, only one (Montreal) has separate stadiums for each.

The term "football-specific stadium" is sometimes used in countries where the sport is known as football rather than soccer, although the term is not common in countries where association football is the dominant sport and thus football-specific stadiums are quite common. The term tends to have a slightly different meaning in these countries, usually referring to a stadium without an [[Sport of athletics|athletics]] [[running track|track]] surrounding the field.<ref>{{cite news |title=Exclusive: We will beat Olympic Stadium claim Tottenham |url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/8542/exclusive-we-will-beat-olympic-stadium-claim-tottenham |access-date=July 24, 2023 |work=insidethegames.biz |date=December 23, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Buenos Aires: Symbolic revamp at El Monumental |url=http://stadiumdb.com/news/2020/09/buenos_aires_symbolic_revamp_at_el_monumental |access-date=July 24, 2023 |work=StadiumDB.com |date=September 10, 2020}}</ref> Some soccer stadiums in Europe are also used for other sports, including rugby, American football, and field hockey. The problem with oversized stadiums designed for another sport is particularly visible in European American football leagues and conflicts between teams sharing the stadium (a notable example are [[Eintracht Braunschweig]] and the [[Braunschweig Lions]] which share a stadium) and (often municipal) owners of the stadiums sometimes arise, leading to attempts at single sport-specific venues.<ref>{{cite news |title=Luxembourg: Only stadium with running track to be demolished? |url=http://stadiumdb.com/news/2012/11/luxembourg_only_stadium_with_running_track_to_be_demolished |access-date=July 24, 2023 |work=StadiumDB.com |date=November 21, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Adelaide United FC vs. Sydney FC at Hindmarsh Stadium - April 2023.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Hindmarsh Stadium]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]]]
In Australia, the term has much the same meaning as in the United States. The dominance of [[Australian rules football]] in the southern states means that unlike in [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]], rectangular stadiums and grounds capable of hosting top level [[A-League]] soccer are rare. [[Hindmarsh Stadium]] in Adelaide, South Australia is an example of such a soccer-specific stadium. Being built in the 1960s and progressively updated, the vast majority of matches played there are soccer, with very rare rugby league or rugby union games. The [[Wyndham City Stadium]] and Wyndham Regional Football Facility are also examples. Many of the lower-tier state league clubs own their own venues, which also qualify as soccer-specific.
