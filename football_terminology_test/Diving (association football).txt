[[File:Possible soccer dive.jpg|thumb|200px|The player in blue and red's raised arms and look at the [[Referee (association football)|referee]] indicate a possible dive.]]

In [[association football]], '''diving''' is an attempt by a player to gain an unfair advantage by falling to the ground and, often, feigning injury to give the impression that a [[foul (football)|foul]] has been committed. Dives are often used to exaggerate the amount of contact made during a [[tackle (football move)#Association football|challenge]]. Deciding whether a player has dived is often very subjective and among the most controversial areas of football discussion. Motivations for diving include receiving scoring opportunities via [[Direct free kick|free kick]]s or [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]s or gaining a team advantage by invoking a [[penalty card]] for the opposition. Diving may also be referred to as '''simulation''' (the term used by [[FIFA]]), '''Schwalbe''' (used in continental European countries; lit. German for "[[swallow]]"), '''staging''' (for free kicks) (Australia) and '''flopping''' (North American sports in general).

== Detection ==
A 2009 study<ref name=tackling>{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Paul |last2=Lewis |first2=David |date=March 2010 |journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior |title=Tackling Diving: The Perception of Deceptive Intentions in Association football |doi= 10.1007/s10919-009-0075-0 |issn=0191-5886 |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |s2cid=143324073 }}</ref> found that there are recognisable traits that can often be observed when a player is diving. They are:
*a separation in time between the impact and the simulation
*a lack of ballistic continuity (the player moves farther than would be expected from the momentum of the tackle)
*lack of contact consistency (the player nurses a body part other than where the impact occurred, such as contact to the chest causing the player to fly to the ground, holding their face)
* the "Archer's bow" pose, where the head is tilted back, chest thrust forward, arms raised and both legs bent at the knee to lift both feet off the ground to the rear, is recognised as a characteristic sign of simulation, as the action is counter to normal reflex mechanisms to protect the body in a fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/6193679/Psychologists-help-referees-spot-a-dive-in-football.html|title=Psychologists help referees spot a dive in football|first=Richard|last=Alleyne|date=16 September 2009|access-date=21 January 2019|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|archive-date=12 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712201936/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/6193679/Psychologists-help-referees-spot-a-dive-in-football.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Punishment==
The [[Laws of the Game (association football)|game's rules]] state that "attempts to deceive the referee by feigning injury or pretending to have been fouled (simulation)" must be sanctioned as [[unsportsmanlike conduct|unsporting behaviour]] which is [[misconduct (football)|misconduct]] punishable by a yellow card.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theifab.com/laws/fouls-and-misconduct/chapters/disciplinary-action |title=Law 12 – Fouls and Misconduct, 3.

===Europe===
In 2009, [[UEFA]] made the decision to ban [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] forward [[Eduardo da Silva]] for a dive during a [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round#Second leg 4|Champions League qualifier]] against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].<ref name="EduardoBan1">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8232544.stm |title=Uefa bans Eduardo for two matches |date=1 September 2009 |access-date=3 January 2014 |publisher=BBC |archive-date=24 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211224012537/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8232544.stm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="EduardoBan2">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/01/eduardo-banned-uefa-diving-arsenal-celtic |title=Eduardo banned for two Champions League matches for diving |date=1 September 2009 |access-date=3 January 2014 |work=The Guardian |archive-date=3 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103181221/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/01/eduardo-banned-uefa-diving-arsenal-celtic |url-status=live }}</ref> Eduardo initially received a penalty after referee [[Manuel Mejuto González]] believed Eduardo had been [[Foul (association football)|fouled]] by Celtic goalkeeper [[Artur Boruc]], but video evidence suggested there was no contact between Eduardo and Boruc.<ref name="EduardoBan1"/> Eduardo scored the subsequent penalty, with the goal putting Arsenal 3–0 up on [[Aggregate score|aggregate]].<ref name="EduardoBan2"/> Arsenal manager [[Arsène Wenger]] claimed the ban, which was to last two games,<ref name="EduardoBan2"/> was "a complete disgrace and unacceptable",<ref name="EduardoBan3">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8223917.stm |title=Wenger angry over Eduardo charge |date=28 August 2009 |access-date=3 January 2014 |publisher=BBC |archive-date=15 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315091027/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8223917.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> as it singled out Eduardo as a cheat, something which UEFA would be unable to prove.<ref name="EduardoBan3"/> The ban was subsequently overturned on appeal,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/14/eduardo-uefa-diving-appeal-arsenal |title=Eduardo walks free after U-turn on diving ban |date=14 September 2009 |access-date=3 January 2014 |work=The Guardian |archive-date=3 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103181813/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/14/eduardo-uefa-diving-appeal-arsenal |url-status=live }}</ref> with Eduardo saying he was pleased UEFA had "arrived at the truth" as he was a "fair player" and was "not the type of player who needs to be dishonest".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8236689.stm |title=Uefa overturns Eduardo diving ban |date=14 September 2009 |access-date=3 January 2014 |publisher=BBC |archive-date=24 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211224012536/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8236689.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>

In England, starting in the summer of 2017, a three-man panel consisting of a former player, a former manager, and a former match official would independently review [[Instant replay#Association football|video evidence]] on the Monday after games. Any player whom the three-man panel unanimously decided had caused an opponent to be sent off or had won a penalty as a result of deceiving the referee by simulation would be charged by [[the Football Association]] with "Successful Deception of a Match Official" which carried a penalty of suspension for two matches. If a player is found guilty of deceiving an official or admits to the charge, the yellow or red card given to the opposing player can be rescinded.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-05-18 |title=Diving bans set for Prem after FA approval |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/english-premier-league/story/3128683/football-association-backs-proposal-for-retrospective-diving-bans |access-date=2023-02-27 |website=ESPN.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Christenson |first=Marcus |date=2017-05-18 |title=FA to introduce retrospective bans for diving from next season |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/18/football-association-introduce-retrospective-bans-diving-feigning-injury-next-season |access-date=2023-02-27 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=FA introduces retrospective action and two-match bans for diving |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/10970106/fa-introduces-retrospective-action-and-two-match-bans-for-diving |access-date=2023-02-27 |website=Sky Sports |language=en}}</ref> In November 2017, [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] player [[Bailey Wright]] became the first player to be banned two matches by the [[The Football Association|Football Association]] for diving while playing against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Aboubakar Kamara]]'s red card was rescinded.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Bristol City's Wright gets simulation ban |language=en-GB |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41862125 |access-date=2023-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Bristol City are fuming over the decision to overturn this red card and ban their player instead |url=https://www.independent.ie/world-news/and-finally/bristol-city-are-fuming-over-the-decision-to-overturn-this-red-card-and-ban-their-player-instead-36287519.html |access-date=2023-02-27 |website=independent |date=3 November 2017 |language=en}}</ref> In November 2017, [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] player [[Oumar Niasse]] became the first top-flight player to be banned two matches by the FA for diving while playing against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Niasse 'exaggerated normal Dann contact' |language=en-GB |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42113397 |access-date=2023-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=22 November 2017 |title=Everton's Oumar Niasse banned for two games for diving against Crystal Palace |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/everton-oumar-niasse-banned-suspended-diving-crystal-palace-a8069976.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122044342/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/everton-oumar-niasse-banned-suspended-diving-crystal-palace-a8069976.html |archive-date=22 January 2019 |access-date=21 January 2019 |website=The Independent}}</ref> In February 2023, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.

===North America===
[[Major League Soccer]] in the United States began implementing fines and suspensions for the [[2011 Major League Soccer season|2011 season]] for simulation through its Disciplinary Committee, which reviews plays after the match.

On 24 June 2011, MLS penalised [[D.C. United]] forward [[Charlie Davies]] with a US$1,000 fine as the Disciplinary Committee ruled he "intentionally deceived the officials and gained an unfair advantage which directly impacted the match" in a simulation that occurred in a match against [[Real Salt Lake]] on 18 June 2011.<ref>{{cite web|date=24 June 2011|title=MLS Disciplinary Committee fines Davies for dive vs. Real Salt Lake|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/06/24/mls-disciplinary-committee-fines-davies-simulation|access-date=21 January 2019|archive-date=30 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230231605/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/06/24/mls-disciplinary-committee-fines-davies-simulation|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 29 July 2011, the Disciplinary Committee suspended Real Salt Lake forward [[Álvaro Saborío]] one game and fined him US$1,000 for a simulation in a game against the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] on 23 July 2011. Officials noted the simulation resulted in Earthquakes defender [[Bobby Burling]] being sent off on the simulation, and the warning from MLS that fines and suspensions will increase for simulation being detected by the Disciplinary Committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/07/29/rsls-sabor%C3%ADo-fined-suspended-dive-vs-quakes|title=Saborío fined, suspended for dive vs. Quakes|access-date=21 January 2019|archive-date=17 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017054359/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/07/29/rsls-sabor%C3%ADo-fined-suspended-dive-vs-quakes|url-status=live}}</ref> Furthermore, suspensions caused by players being sent off by another player's simulation can be rescinded.  For example, if A2 is assessed a red card for a foul when B3 had created a simulation to make it seem A2 committed a hard foul when it was a simulation, the Disciplinary Committee can rescind the red card and suspension for A2.

===Oceania===
In all football leagues, including youth leagues, a player who dives intentionally will be subject to a warning or yellow card if caught in a match. If a match is reviewed and a player is caught, they may receive a one match suspension. In cases where this occurs a third time in a season, a five match suspension will be issued, or a suspension until the end of the current season, whichever is longer. The Oceania Football Confederation also has the right to ban players who intentionally dive to get a penalty or free kick. These rules are in effect for club and international matches. 

== Diving as deceptive behaviour ==

In 2011, researchers studying signalling in animals examined diving in the context of [[communication theory]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=Receivers Limit the Prevalence of Deception in Humans: Evidence from Diving Behaviour in Soccer Players|first1=Robbie S.|last1=Wilson|first2=Daniel|last2=Ortiz-Barrientos|first3=Candice L.|last3=Bywater|first4=Catriona H.|last4=Condon|first5=Gwendolyn K.|last5=David|date=5 October 2011|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=6|issue=10|article-number=e26017|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0026017|pmid=21998745|pmc=3187838|bibcode=2011PLoSO...626017D|doi-access=free}}</ref> which suggests that deceptive behaviour should occur when the potential payoffs outweigh the potential costs (or punishments). Their aim was to discern when and where diving is likely to occur, with the aim of identifying ways to stop it.

The researchers watched hundreds of hours of matches across six European professional leagues and found that diving is more likely to occur a) near the offensive goal and b) when the match is tied. None of the 169 dives seen in the study were punished.

It was also found that diving was more common in leagues where it was rewarded most – meaning that the more often players were likely to get free kicks or penalties out of a dive, the more often they dived. This suggests that the benefits of diving are far outweighing the costs, and the only way to reduce diving in football is by increasing the ability of referees to detect dives and by increasing the punishment associated with them.

Dr. Robbie Wilson, a member of the group that conducted the study, said: "Some progressive professional leagues, such as the Australian [[A-League]] and the American MLS have already started handing down punishments for players found guilty of diving. This is the best way to decrease the incentive for diving".<ref>{{cite web|date=6 October 2011|title=Tackling the Problem of Diving in Football|url=http://www.soccerscience.net/2011/10/tackling-problem-of-diving-in-football.html|work=soccerscience.net|access-date=3 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210623205608/https://www.soccerscience.net/2011/10/tackling-problem-of-diving-in-football.html|archive-date=23 June 2021}}</ref>

Some have referred to simulation as a menace to footballers with real, sometimes life-threatening, injuries or conditions. On 24 May 2012, English [[The Football Association|FA]] referee [[Howard Webb]] spoke to a FIFA medical conference in [[Budapest]] about the importance of curbing simulation in football, as players feigning injury could put players with serious medical issues in jeopardy. Earlier that year, he had to deal with the collapse of [[Fabrice Muamba]], who suffered [[cardiac arrest]] during an [[2011–12 FA Cup#Sixth round proper|FA Cup]] match.<ref name="budapest">{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/sports/soccer/story/_/id/7966919/referee-howard-webb-injury-fakers-jeopardize-really-hurt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527060113/http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/story/_/id/7966919/referee-howard-webb-injury-fakers-jeopardize-really-hurt|url-status=live|title=Referee: Don't 'cry wolf' on injuries|work=ESPN Soccer|author=<!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line -->|date=24 May 2012 |agency=Associated Press|archive-date=27 May 2012}}</ref>

==Diving reputation==
Repeated accusations of diving have resulted in certain players acquiring the reputation of being a "diver".

Over the years, players who have a reputation of being divers include:
