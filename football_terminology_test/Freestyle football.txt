'''Freestyle [[Association football|football]]''' ('''football juggling and tricks''') is the art of [[juggling]] a [[Ball (association football)|football]] using any part of the body, excluding the elbows to the hands. It combines football tricks, dance, acrobatics and music to entertain onlookers and compete with opponents. The official governing body for this sport is known as the [[World Freestyle Football Association]] (WFFA).<ref name="WWFA"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/y=2016/m=8/video=freestyle-football-in-russia-2824087.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905230947/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/y=2016/m=8/video=freestyle-football-in-russia-2824087.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 5, 2016 |title=Freestyle football in Russia |publisher=FIFA.com |date=2016-07-23 |access-date=2016-09-11}}</ref>

==History==
The art of freestyle football can be traced to games of Southeast Asia such as [[chinlone]], [[jianzi]] and [[sepak takraw]], which have been practised for 2,000 years. Fundamental freestyle tricks such as the 'Neck Stall' and 'Around The World' were first popularly performed in the West by circus performers, notably including [[Enrico Rastelli]] and [[Francis Brunn]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://freestylefootball.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/The-History-of-Freestyle-Football.pdf|title= The History of Freestyle Football|access-date= 2011-03-09|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110627044847/http://freestylefootball.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/The-History-of-Freestyle-Football.pdf|archive-date= 2011-06-27}}</ref><ref name="WWFAaboutsport">{{cite web | url=http://www.thewffa.org/about/sport |title = World Freestyle Football Association news| date=25 March 2024 }}</ref>

In the 1970s and 1980s, Argentine footballer [[Diego Maradona]] famously brought his freestyle 'Life is Life' warm-up to international attention while playing for [[SSC&nbsp;Napoli]]. The ability to freestyle, however, was widely criticized at the time as not having direct relevance to playing the game of [[association football|football]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

At the beginning of the 21st century, several significant events helped elevate freestyle football with broader recognition. Brazilian footballer [[Ronaldinho]] starred in [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] advertising campaigns such as "Joga Bonito" (English: Play Beautifully), which popularized the ability to practice alone with a ball and develop new moves and tricks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/best-football-adverts-all-time-ever|title=The 14 best football adverts EVER|first1=Future Publishing Limited Quay|last1=House|first2=The|last2=Ambury|first3=Bath BA1 1UA All rights reserved|last3=Engl|first4=Wales company registration|last4=number 2008885|date=Jun 25, 2019|website=FourFourTwo|access-date=Oct 19, 2019}}</ref>

Inspired by Maradona, South Korean footballer [[Woo Hee-young|Mr Woo]] sought to become a football entertainer. He established [[Guinness Book of World Records|Guinness world records]] and performed at the [[1988 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]], and the FIFA World Cups in 1990 and 1994.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/south_korea/features/newsid_2075000/2075739.stm |title = Woo magic woos fans|date = 2002-06-30}}</ref> [[Soufiane Touzani]]<ref name="Touzani">http://www.touzaniproductions.nl/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210154716/http://www.touzaniproductions.nl/ |date=2017-12-10 }} Touzani Productions</ref> from the Netherlands introduced a new style of lower tricks, which were popularized through [[viral videos]].<ref name="Touzani"/>{{better source needed|date=September 2019}}

In 2015, Ronaldinho was recognized by the [[World Freestyle Football Association]] (WFFA) as ambassador for the sport.<ref name="WWFAaboutsport"/>{{clarify timeframe|date=September 2019|According to the WFFA article, it was only founded in 2017.

In recent years, some of the top football players in the world have credited freestyle and street football cultures for helping to develop their talents. These athletes have included [[Neymar Jr]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/performance/training/neymar-jr-futsal-street-football-and-tricks |title = Neymar Jr on futsal, street football and tricks|date = 2016-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.redbull.com/se-en/events/neymar-five-malmo | title=Neymar Jr's Five - Malmö| website=[[Red Bull]]}}</ref> [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Lionel Messi]] and [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

==Tricks==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}
Tricks or moves in freestyle football are categorized into different disciplines or styles:
*	Lower body or air move tricks are performed while standing, and use the feet or legs. (lowers)
*	Upper body tricks are performed with the head, chest and shoulders. (uppers)
*	Sitting tricks are performed while seated, often with the legs elevated. (sit-downs)
*	Ground move tricks are performed while standing with the ball on the floor.{{explain|date=September 2019|What's the trick in standing next to a ball?}} Skillful players can make the performance of ground moves seem like a choreographed dance.
*	Blocking tricks are performed by holding the ball with various parts of the lower body. It is a style inspired by [[breakdancing]].
*	Acrobatic tricks are inspired by [[circus skills]], breakdancing and gymnastics.
*	Transitions are intermediate moves used to bridge tricks in different styles, ideally in a fluid motion.

Within the above disciplines, the following individual moves are among the most popular: 
*	Around the World (ATW), a move in which the freestyler plays the ball off of one foot, which then circles up and over the ball before returning underneath to play the ball again. An inside ATW makes the initial movement toward the opposite leg, while an outside ATW makes the initial movement away from the opposite leg.
*	Crossover, a move in which the ball is kicked into the air with one leg, and the opposite leg goes around the ball while it is in the air.
*	Toe Bounce (TB) a move like a crossover but with the ball bouncing on the foot.{{explain|date=September 2019|which foot? unclear}}
*	Hop the World (HTW), a move in which the ball is kicked up with one foot and circled with the opposite foot.{{clarify|date=September 2019|reason=How does this differ from a Crossover?}}
**	Touzani around the World (TATW), a variation of an outside ATW and a crossover.{{explain|date=September 2019}} Created by [[Soufiane Touzani]] from the Netherlands.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}
**	Mitchy around the World (MATW), as with the TATW except with an inside ATW. Created by Mitchell James Penn from the UK.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}
**	Lemmens Around the World (LATW), a double ATW, circling the foot twice around the airborne ball without a middle touch between revolutions.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}
**	Palle Around the World (PATW), a triple ATW. Created by Rickard "Palle" Sjolander of Sweden.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}
*	Stalls, moves which involve catching the ball in a stationary position. This is commonly on the back of the neck but also includes balancing on the forehead or wedged between the heel and thigh.
*Clipper, a move that originated from [[freestyle footbag]] in which the freestyler catches the ball midair with the inside of the foot on the side of the body.
*	Combos, moves which directly connect tricks without juggling the ball.
*	No-touch combos, tricks performed in one motion without any intermediate ball touch.  For example, the LATW is a two ATW no-touch combo.

==Competitive freestyle==
The first major competition for freestyle football was Red Bull Street Style (RBSS) in 2008, which was hosted in São Paulo, Brazil.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} [[Séan Garnier]] won this competition with a style that had not been seen in the public eye before.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Super Ball, the first open world championship (where anyone could compete) catered to freestylers with ranging styles, recognizing the many ways to judge a freestyler. Hosted in the Czech Republic, Super Ball became the premiere annual international event for freestylers.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}
