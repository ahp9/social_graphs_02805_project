An '''own goal''' occurs in sports when a player performs actions that result in scoring points for the opposition, such as when a [[Association football|football]]er puts a ball into their own net.

In some parts of the world, the term has become a [[metaphor]] for ''any'' action that backfires on the person or group undertaking it, sometimes even carrying a sense of "[[poetic justice]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/own+goal |title=thefreedictionary.com |publisher=thefreedictionary.com |access-date=2013-11-02 |archive-date=25 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725204830/http://www.thefreedictionary.com/own+goal |url-status=live }}</ref> During [[The Troubles]], for instance, it acquired a specific metaphorical meaning in [[Belfast]], referring to an IED ([[improvised explosive device]]) that detonated prematurely, killing the person making or handling the bomb with the intent to harm others.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/terrorists-killed-by-their-own-devices-1319857.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220524/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/terrorists-killed-by-their-own-devices-1319857.html |archive-date=24 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Terrorists killed by their own devices | date=1996-02-20}}</ref>

{{see also|List of FIFA World Cup own goals|List of FIFA Women's World Cup own goals|List of UEFA European Championship own goals}}
In [[association football]], an own goal occurs when a player causes the ball to go into their own team's [[Goal (sport)|goal]], resulting in a [[Scoring in association football|goal being scored]] for the opposition. Defenders often "turn behind" dangerous balls into the [[penalty area]], particularly crosses, by kicking or heading the ball out of play behind their goal-line.  In this way, the defender's aim is to concede a [[corner kick|corner]] rather than giving attacking players scoring opportunities.  Consequently, the defender may misjudge and inadvertently turn the ball into their own goal, particularly if they are under pressure from attacking players who might otherwise score. While the defending player who scored the own goal is personally "credited" with the goal as part of the statistical abstract of the game (with the annotation "(og)" to indicate its nature), own goals are not added to a player's seasonal or career goalscoring total.

The [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] currently stipulate that an own goal cannot be scored directly from most methods of restarting the game;{{#tag:ref|A theoretical exception is the [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]];<ref>LOTG 14 "A goal may be scored directly from a penalty kick"</ref> however, since the ball must be kicked forward, an own goal from a penalty kick would require an extraordinary set of circumstances to occur.<ref>LOTG 14.1 "The player taking the penalty kick must kick the ball forward"</ref>|group="nb"}} instead, a [[corner kick]] is awarded to the attacking team.

Major competitions may have video reviews which can alter the accreditation, such as the [[Dubious Goals Committee]] of the FA Premier League.

The most own goals by a player is held by Irish footballer [[Richard Dunne]] with 10 own goals in his career and the most own goals by a club is held by English team [[Everton F.C.]] The most infamous own goal was perhaps that of [[Andrés Escobar]] from [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] which ended in a 2–1 loss against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and knocked Colombia out; a week later, Escobar was shot dead in Colombia by a drug gang member whose boss had lost betting on the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asktheref.com/Soccer%20Rules/Question/21754/|title=Question 21754: Law 10 - Method of Scoring|date=7 August 2009|access-date=16 August 2017|archive-date=16 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816235450/http://asktheref.com/Soccer%20Rules/Question/21754/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Another notable own goal was scored in a [[Barbados 4–2 Grenada|1994 Caribbean Cup match]] between Barbados and Grenada. To advance in the competition Barbados needed to win by a margin of 2 or more goals. Because they were winning by just one goal as the match was nearly over, they deliberately scored an own goal to take the match into extra time to give themselves an opportunity to score a goal in extra time. Due to unusual tournament rules, this would not only win the game but also be [[Golden goal#Association football|worth 2 goals]] allowing them to advance on goal difference.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ashdown|first=John|date=2011-05-25|title=Who are the greatest runners-up ever?|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/25/the-greatest-runners-up-ever|access-date=2021-06-20|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-date=28 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210628023059/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/25/the-greatest-runners-up-ever|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Ice hockey==
If a [[goal (hockey)|goal]] is scored by a player on the defending team, credit for the goal goes to the last player on the other team to have touched the [[hockey puck|puck]]; this is because own goals in hockey are typically cases where the player so credited had the shot deflected{{cite needed|date=May 2024}}, but this convention is used even where this is not the case. Occasionally, it is also credited to the closest player to the goal from the other team if he is determined to have caused the opposing player to shoot it into the wrong net. Assists are not awarded on an own goal because the defending team has possession of the puck between any pass and the goal itself. Occasionally in the [[National Hockey League]], players have directed the puck into their own [[empty net]], either late in the game or because of a [[delayed penalty call]]. This was the situation which resulted in [[Billy Smith (ice hockey)|Billy Smith]] of the [[New York Islanders]] becoming the first [[goaltender]] to receive credit for a goal in the NHL. Indeed, of the 20 goals [[List of goalscoring NHL goaltenders|scored by goaltenders in the NHL]], 8 were the result of an own goal.

==Field hockey==
Treatment of "own goals" in field hockey has varied over recent years. In 2013 the [[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH) implemented a "mandatory experiment" such that a deflection of a shot from outside the shooting circle from a defender would be equivalent to a touch from an attacker, and thus if the shot continued into the goal the score would be counted. This proved unpopular and the change was reversed.<ref name="FIH-withdraw">{{cite news|last1=Bone|first1=Ross|title=Talking Hockey: own goal rule wiped out creativity, though umpires likely to disagree|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/hockey/10477968/Talking-Hockey-own-goal-rule-wiped-out-creativity-though-umpires-likely-to-disagree.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/hockey/10477968/Talking-Hockey-own-goal-rule-wiped-out-creativity-though-umpires-likely-to-disagree.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|access-date=15 August 2016|work=Telegraph|date=27 November 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Presently rule 8.1 states that ''"A goal is scored when the ball is played within the circle by an attacker and does not travel outside the circle before passing completely over the goal-line and under the crossbar."'' Added clarification: ''"The ball may be played by a defender or touch their body before or after being played in the circle by an attacker."''<ref name="FIH_rules">{{cite web|title=Rules of Hockey|url=http://www.fih.ch/media/8997802/rules-of-hockey-2015.pdf|publisher=FIH|access-date=15 August 2016|date=2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106060507/http://www.fih.ch/media/8997802/rules-of-hockey-2015.pdf|archive-date=6 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Thus, an "own goal" may occur, but in such situations the goal will likely be credited to the attacker whose initial play into the circle was necessary for the goal to stand.

==Basketball==
When accidentally scoring at an opposing team's basket (basketball's equivalent of an "own goal"), the goal is credited to an offensive player. One typical own-goal scenario occurs when a player tries to block a goal shot but ends up knocking the ball into the goal.

In [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] basketball, the two points are merely listed for the scoring team, as a footnote.

In [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] basketball, the rules state: "When a player scores a field goal in the opponent's basket, it shall count two points for the opponent regardless of the location on the playing court from where it was released. Such a field goal shall not be credited to a player in the scorebook but shall be indicated with a footnote."

In [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] rules, the goal is credited to the player on the scoring team who is closest to defensive shooter and is mentioned in a footnote.

Under [[FIBA]] rules, the player designated captain is credited with the basket, though deliberate own goals are a violation and do not score any points.<ref name=familiar>{{cite news |last1=Alba |first1=Katrina |title=Seems familiar: Scoring in own basket and Georgia's 'Mission Impossible' vs Gilas in FIBA OQT |url=https://www.onesports.ph/gilas/article/22427/seems-familiar-scoring-in-own-basket-and-georgia-s-mission-impossible-vs-gilas-in-fiba-oqt#:~:text=Rule%2016.2.3%20states%3A%20If,the%20goal%20does%20not%20count. |access-date=6 July 2024 |work=One Sports |date=5 July 2024 |language=en}}</ref>

Due to point differential tiebreaker rules, there are at least two instances of players from the leading team deliberately attempting to score in the opponent's basket to force an overtime. These were in the Philippines' 67–65 quarterfinal group match win over Kazakhstan in the [[Basketball at the 2014 Asian Games – Men|2014 Asian Games]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=Terrado |first1=Reuben |title=Reyes justifies Gilas decision to go for 'own goal' against Kazakhstan but Fiba rules clear on matter |url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/fiba/douthit-nullified-basket-chot-reyes-gilas-kazakhstan-asian-games-basketball-philippines-2014 |access-date=6 July 2024 |work=Sports Interactive Network Philippines |date=28 September 2014 |language=en}}</ref> and in Georgia's 96–94 group stage victory over the Philippines in the [[2024 FIBA Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournaments – Riga|2024 Riga FIBA Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournament]]. To advance to their respective semifinals, the Philippines needed to win by 11 or more points against Kazakhstan, and Georgia had to win by 19 or more points against the Philippines.<ref name=familiar/>

==American football==
When a ball carrier is tackled or exits the field of play within the end zone being defended by his team, the result is a [[Safety (American football score)|safety]] and the opposing team is awarded two points, and receives the ball after a free kick taken at the twenty-yard line (this does not apply if the ball carrier secures possession of the ball in the end zone as a result of an interception or a kick; in that case, no points are awarded and the play is considered a [[touchback]]).

A true "own goal", in which the team place kicks or drop kicks the ball through their own goal posts (which has never happened at any level in football history and would require either a very strong headwind or a deliberate act of sabotage), is treated as any other backward kick in most leagues' rule books. Backward kicks are treated as [[fumble]]s, and as such, a backward kick through the back of the end zone, including through the goal posts, is scored as a safety.

On two occasions, players disoriented after recovering a [[fumble]] have returned the ball into their own teams's [[end zone]], believing they had scored a [[touchdown]] only to see the other team receiving a safety. [[Roy Riegels]] took a ball 69 yards (more than half the length of the field) to his own end zone during the [[1929 Rose Bowl]] while playing for the [[California Golden Bears football|University of California]], and in 1964 [[Minnesota Vikings]]' defensive lineman [[Jim Marshall (defensive end)|Jim Marshall]] went 66 yards pursued by his own teammates in an attempt to prevent him from scoring two points for the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. Both men have been remembered for those blunders despite accomplished careers otherwise.

In the final minutes of a game, a team may take a deliberate safety in order to get the free kick, rather than punting from the end zone, or to otherwise [[running out the clock|run out the clock]]. In 2003, the [[New England Patriots]] came back to win a game after giving a safety that put them three points behind.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/espn/wire?id=1653659 |title=Belichick's gamble pays off for Patriots - NFL - ESPN |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=2003-11-04 |access-date=2013-11-02 |archive-date=4 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104164953/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?id=1653659 |url-status=live }}</ref> Similarly, the [[Baltimore Ravens]] took a safety with twelve seconds left in [[Super Bowl XLVII]] instead of punting out of the end zone, cutting their lead to three points but winning the game since they were able to burn eight seconds off the clock with the safety play, and the opposing [[San Francisco 49ers]] were unable to score on the ensuing free kick.

==Canadian football==
In [[Canadian football]], if a scrimmage kick (punt or missed field goal attempt) is kicked into the end zone and the opponent does not advance it out, the kicking team is awarded a [[Single (Canadian football)|single]], worth one point.

In the [[2017 Grey Cup]], the [[Calgary Stampeders]] deliberately took a safety when their punter [[Rob Maver]], having lost control of a high snap, was faced with loss of down deep in his own territory.  He intentionally kicked the ball backwards through the back of his own end zone for a safety.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/sports/football/argonauts-slay-mighty-stampeders-in-snowy-epic-grey-cup/wcm/cbf1448f-638d-49d3-aa91-17a64e848367|title=Argonauts slay mighty Stampeders in epic, snowy Grey Cup|last=Baines|first=Tim|date=26 November 2017|newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|access-date=26 November 2017|archive-date=29 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129163300/http://ottawacitizen.com/sports/football/argonauts-slay-mighty-stampeders-in-snowy-epic-grey-cup/wcm/cbf1448f-638d-49d3-aa91-17a64e848367|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Gaelic football==
[[Gaelic football]]ers can play the ball with their hands; therefore, they have a much greater degree of control over the ball and thus, own goals are much rarer than they are in association football. They do occur, and two were scored by [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] in the [[2016 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final#Match 1|drawn 2016 All-Ireland SFC Final]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2016/0918/817360-all-ireland-final-updates-dublin-v-mayo/|title=Recap: How the All-Ireland football final unfolded|date=18 September 2016|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|access-date=15 August 2017|archive-date=16 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816005732/https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2016/0918/817360-all-ireland-final-updates-dublin-v-mayo/|url-status=live}}</ref>

As an own goal is scored when the ball goes under the crossbar, so an "own point" is scored (like any other point) when the ball goes over the crossbar. However, when a shot on goal is deflected over the bar by the defending team, the point is credited to the attacker who shot and not considered an "own point".

==Australian rules football==
{{main|Rushed behind}}
As a legitimate defensive play, an [[Australian rules football]] defender may concede an "own score". Such a score, referred to as a ''rushed behind'' and statistically credited to no player (score sheets simply include the tally of rushed behinds), results in the opposition team scoring one point. A defending player may choose to concede a rushed behind when the risk of the opposition scoring a goal (worth six points) is high. It is impossible for a team to concede an own goal worth six points.
