A '''stanchion''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|æ|n|tʃ|ən}}) is a sturdy upright fixture that provides support for some other object.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stanchion|title=Stanchion - Definition and More|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=8 July 2012}}</ref> It can be a permanent fixture.

==Types==

In [[architecture]], stanchions are the upright iron bars in windows that pass through the eyes of the {{linktext | saddle bar}}s or horizontal irons to steady the [[leadlight]]. The French call the latter ''traverses'', the stanchions ''montants'', and the whole arrangement ''armature''. Stanchions frequently finish with ornamental heads forged out of the iron.<ref>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Stanchion |volume=25 |page=772 |inline=1}}</ref>

Stanchions are also the metal supporting members of [[lighting]] mounted from a lower elevation. This includes the metal inclined member for mounting a [[streetlight]] to a telephone or power pole, and the dedicated metal vertical support of a self-supporting or bottom-fed streetlight. In this case, the stanchion pole may double as the [[Electrical conduit|raceway]] for the electrical feed to the lighting.

In industrial installations, walkway lighting may be mounted with a stanchion that is secured to a handrail. Stanchion lights are typically spaced {{convert|50|ft|m|2}} along walkways, such as [[conveyor belt|conveyor]] platforms.

Stanchions ([[baluster]]s or [[Bollard (traffic)|bollard]]s) are also the upright posts inserted into the ground or floor to protect the corner of a wall.

In [[event management]] a stanchion is an upright bar or post that includes or connects to retractable belts, velvet ropes, or plastic chains, sometimes in conjunction with wall-mounted barrier devices, [[barricade]]s, and printed [[signage]]<ref>{{cite web |last1 =Marinho |first1 =Giuliano |title=What Is a Stanchion: A Stanchion Definition Complete Guide! |url =https://www.safetysticklers.com/what-is-a-stanchion/ |website =Safety Sticklers |date =31 July 2020 |access-date =20 November 2023}}</ref> and often used for [[crowd control]] and engineering people-flow and [[construction site safety | construction-site safety]].

==Uses==

Stanchions are used for many different purposes, including crowd control, [[Queue area|queues]], waiting lines, and management of large groups of people. Many different places use stanchions, including banks, building societies, and credit unions; stores, from larger department stores to trendy boutiques; hotels and conference centers; museums; restaurants and cafes; nightclubs and beach clubs; concert venues, sports arenas, and stadiums; airports (including at check-in, security screening, gates, and immigration), train stations, ports, and other mass transport venues; government facilities such as the department of motor vehicles or courthouses; trade shows, art shows, and comic conventions; art and opera festivals; and fairgrounds, circuses, and other events. Notably, stanchions are rarely used in domestic settings or in small businesses where such a marker is not warranted, such as rural cafes or microbreweries.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}
* Portable posts used to manage [[queue area|lines and queues]].
** Fixed posts with decorative ropes, custom-printed belts, or metal wires. Often available in single, double, and triple belt/wire configurations.
** Retractable belt stanchions, often with a heavy low-profile base to offset possible trip hazard and stanchion tipping, and often also with a slowly retracting spring-operated belt mechanism for safety. (Some have a "Universal Belt End," allowing for connectivity between multiple makes.) In [[museum]]s, such stanchions are used to protect items and remind visitors that they are not to be touched.
* Around construction work sites, conspicuous markers of hazardous areas. Stanchions used for this purpose usually have bright safety colors, like orange or yellow, and often come with attachments for safety signs, warning passersby of the danger in the area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.crowdcontrolwarehouse.com/blogs/blog/what-are-stanchions-stanchion-definitions-types-of-stanchions|title=What are Stanchions?

* Retracting belt barriers affixed to traffic cones with reflective print.
* Vertical supports for chains or ropes, as in marine applications, such as those for lifelines on [[yacht]]s or [[boat]]s.
** [[Stanchion (nautical)|Nautical stanchions]]
* Metal mounts securing the [[head restraint|headrest]] to the seat in a car.
* In [[association football]] and other goal-based sports, horizontal or diagonal extensions to the [[goalpost]]s that prevent the goalnet from drooping.
* In [[military aircraft]], vertical supports for troop seating temporarily installed in [[cargo aircraft]].
* On board most buses and trams/subways, vertical supports to provide stability when passengers are [[Standing passenger|standing]]. They are located throughout most city buses and are connected to seats, floor, roof, etc.
* The metal head bails in [[dairy farming|dairy barns]] that lock the cows in place while they are milked.
* The two lower members of a suspension [[bicycle fork]] that connect to the crown (also called fork legs).
* In [[river rafting]], metal bars that hold the yokes for oars.
* In [[ice hockey]], the posts used on the dasher boards to hold panes of glass in place. This is a common vernacular term in the sport, although in the industry they are simply called posts.
* The upright part of the frame around a windscreen (the A [[Pillar (car)|pillar]]).
* In stores, a stanchion supplied by a manufacturer can be placed on the counter to display their product, such as candy.

== Stanchions to locate fire hydrants under deep snow ==
A heavy [[Winter storm|snowfall]] or a [[blizzard]] buries the [[fire hydrant]]s, making it very hard to find them unless their location is adequately indicated.

* Removable and swiveling or fixed [[metal]] or [[wood]]en stanchions in sockets at the edges of the flatbed of [[flatcar]]s, [[flat wagon]]s, or the ends of the bolsters of a [[bogie bolster wagon]].
* Removable and swiveling metal or wooden stanchions in sockets at the edges of the flatbed of [[Semi-trailer#Types|flatbed semi-trailers]], [[flatbed truck]]s, or [[logging truck]]s. In all cases, the lower end is shaped so as to hold it in place. 
* In British and Australian English, the term is applied to the support structures for railway [[Overhead line|overhead power]]{{citation needed|date=November 2024}}.
