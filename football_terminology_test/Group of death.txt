A '''group of death''' in a [[multi-stage tournament]] is a [[group tournament|group]] which is unusually competitive, because the number of strong competitors in the group is greater than the number of qualifying places available for the next phase of the tournament. Thus, in the group phase, one or more strong competitors in the "group of death" will necessarily be eliminated, who would otherwise have been expected to progress further in the tournament. The informal term was first used for groups in the [[FIFA World Cup]] finals. It is now also used in other [[association football]] tournaments and other sports.

After the draw for a tournament has been made, debates often arise about which of the preliminary groups is "the" group of death.  This happens for multiple reasons: in part, from more general debates about the relative strengths of the various competitors; but, additionally, because there is no exact definition of the term "group of death".  Sometimes, the term simply signifies a group with only the strongest competitors, all of which are potential winners of the tournament, implying there is always precisely one such group; other definitions allow for multiple groups of death or for none at all.

The term is sometimes derided as a purely journalistic invention, a [[cliché]],<ref name="Limey">{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/soccer/01/27/the.limey/index.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130119200007/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/soccer/01/27/the.limey/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 January 2013 |title=Groups of death, Chop Suey and other soccer clichés |last=Pickstone |first=Jon |author2=Ben Franklin |date=27 January 2006|work=The Limey  |publisher=SI.com|access-date=4 December 2009}}</ref><ref name="ian-paul">{{cite news |page=10 |title=Dutch can live in the Milan 'Group of Death' |first=Ian |last=Paul |work=The Herald |date=23 November 1992 |location=Glasgow |quote=If that notorious nickname of 1986, "The Group of Death," which was used to describe Scotland's section in the World Cup finals in Mexico, was the child of an over-enthusiastic hack, three of the teams in Group B of the Champions' League would consider it a mild moniker for their section. }}</ref><ref name="Lovejoy"/> or oversimplification based entirely on the unsportsmanlike notion that outcomes of such sports tournaments are largely predictable and that there are always [[Underdog (term)|underdog]]s, [[dark horse]]s and [[wikt:top dog|top dog]]s.<ref name="surprises"/><ref name="Hawkey">{{cite news |url=https://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2093-2209740,00.html |title=African dream lives in Ivory tower |last=Hawkey |first=Ian |date=4 June 2006 |work=The Sunday Times |access-date=4 December 2009 |quote=The Group of Death has always been an ugly misnomer, although as every big tournament now seems obliged to identify its corpses early, the World Cup has to have one. }}{{dead link|date=September 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

==Origin==
The term "group of death" was coined (as {{langx|es|grupo de la muerte}}) by Mexican journalists for [[1970 FIFA World Cup#Group 3|Group 3 of the 1970 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The beautiful team: in search of Pelé and the 1970 Brazilians |first=Garry |last=Jenkins |author2=Pedro Redig |author3=Antonio Pires Soares  |year=1998 |isbn=0-684-81955-4 |page=22 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |quote=[[João Saldanha|Saldanha]] had no argument with the journalists who quickly christened the Group of Death.}}

==Seedings==
Tournaments are often [[Seed (sports)|seeded]] to provide an even distribution of strong and weak competitors across all preliminary groups.<ref name="life2002f">

</ref> However, in association football, the ranking methods used for seeding may be crude. In the World Cup, until 2018 the usual strategy was for each group to contain one seeded team and three unseeded teams, with the unseeded teams picked from separate regional confederations.<ref>

Even in competitions that give no seeding advantage to hosts or defending champions, "group of death" scenarios can still emerge. For example, the draw for the pools of the [[Rugby World Cup]] (union) primarily uses teams' positions in the [[World Rugby Rankings]] to determine placement in the "pots" for the draw. However, the draw has traditionally been held nearly three years before the competition. For example, the pool draw for the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]] was held in December 2012. This led to the host team, [[England national rugby union team|England]], being drawn into a pool that included traditional powers [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], with only two teams able to advance to the knockout stage. Because Wales had gone winless in their [[2012 end-of-year rugby union internationals|November 2012 Tests]], they had dropped to ninth in the rankings at the time of the draw. Australia were third and England fifth at the time, placing all three teams into separate pots. In August 2015, [[World Rugby]] CEO [[Brett Gosper]] told the [[Press Association]] that the body was seriously considering rescheduling the draw for future World Cups to be much closer in time to the competition.<ref name="2015 RWC">{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/story/_/id/13464085/rugby-world-cup-organisers-seek-change-avoid-pool-death-scenarios-year-england-wales-australia |title=Rugby World Cup bosses will try to avoid 'pool of death' scenarios |agency=Press Association |publisher=[[ESPN (UK)]] |date=19 August 2015 |access-date=20 August 2015}}</ref> However, this change could not be implemented for the [[2019 Rugby World Cup]] mainly because of the potential for ticketing clashes with the [[2020 Summer Olympics]], since Japan was to host both events.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/story/_/id/14040768/japan-juggling-2019-rugby-world-cup-2020-tokyo-olympic-games |title=How the 2020 Olympic Games will affect the 2019 Rugby World Cup |first=Rob |last=Bartlett |publisher=[[ESPN (UK)]] |date=3 November 2015 |access-date=13 November 2015}}</ref>

==Debates and definitions==
In the [[FIFA World Cup]] tournament proper, the [[UEFA European Championship]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]], each preliminary group has four teams, two of which qualify for the knockout phase. Some sources imply all four teams must be in contention for a "group of death";<ref name="Wagman" /><ref name="SanJose"/><ref name="Chapman"/> others allow for three teams fighting for two places, with one underdog making up the numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/finaldraw/news/newsid=1142570.html |title=Who's afraid of the Group of Death? |date=2 December 2009 |publisher=FIFA |access-date=4 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205174903/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/finaldraw/news/newsid%3D1142570.html |archive-date=5 December 2009}}</ref> In the latter case, the term gains an additional facet from the expected "death" of the weak team: 
the Glasgow ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|Herald]]'' described [[UEFA Euro 1992 Group B|Euro 1992 Group B]] as the "Group of Certain Death" because Scotland were grouped with the Netherlands, Germany, and the [[CIS national football team|CIS]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Let's be brave and add a touch of arrogance to our challenge |page=8 |first=James |last=Traynor |work=The Herald |date=8 June 1992 |location=Glasgow |quote=It was said before Scotland's participation in the finals of the 1986 World Cup that, having been drawn with Denmark, Germany and Uruguay, they had been placed in the Group of Death, but this time it could be said they are in the Group of Certain Death.}}</ref> More extreme still, Ian Paul suggested [[1992–93 UEFA Champions League#Group B|semi-final Group B of the 1992–93 UEFA Champions League]] was a "group of death" for all but one team, [[AC Milan]], who were almost sure to top the group and reach the [[1993 European Cup Final|final]].<ref name="ian-paul" /> Milan ultimately won all six matches against [[IFK Göteborg]], [[FC Porto|Porto]], and [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]].

In the case of UEFA qualifying tournaments, groups have deeper seeding and always feature some weaker teams. For example, [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group B|Qualifying Group B]] for Euro 2008 was dubbed the "group of death" in Scotland because Scotland were drawn against Italy, France, and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], respectively champion, finalist, and quarter-finalist at the 2006 World Cup. The presence in the group of [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]], [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]], and the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]] did not contribute to the label.<ref name="Limey" /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jan/28/newsstory.sport12 |title=Smith rues fall-out of Scotland slump in group of death |first=Dominic |last=Fifield |work=The Guardian |date=28 January 2006  |access-date=3 December 2009 |quote=a tough Euro 2008 qualifying group which will see his side face France, Italy and Ukraine }}</ref>

In the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League group stage there were six groups which all contained four teams, but only the group winners and the two second-placed teams with the best records would qualify for the next round. In that season, Group C (Holders Real Madrid, 1998 UEFA Cup Winners Internazionale, 1998 UEFA Cup semi-finalists Spartak Moscow and comparative minoows Sturm Graz) and Group D (Spanish champions Barcelona, former Champions Cup winners Bayern Munich and Manchester United as well as relative minnows Brøndby) could well be considered groups of death. In the event, those groups were the two whose second-placed teams would go on to have the best records among second-placed teams, and the top two teams of Group D, Bayern Munich and Manchester United, would go on to contest the final.

The label may be entirely subjective and applied to one's favorite team.

===Variant definitions===
"Group of death" has occasionally been used to characterise a qualifying group in some other way.

Scotland manager [[Andy Roxburgh]] described [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 2|Euro 1992 qualifying Group 2]] as a "group of death" in a different sense because of the lack of a glamorous opponent "to get people out of the house and into [[Hampden Park]]."<ref>{{cite news |title=Roxburgh sure of delivery - Group Two: Scotland v San Marino |first=Patrick |last=Glenn |work=The Guardian |date=13 November 1991 |location=London |quote=I called this the group of death because there wasn't a big country to brighten it, to capture the imagination, to get people out of the house and into Hampden Park. Romania and Bulgaria have outstanding talents but they are not a draw. The Swiss are the same, emergent and improving, but not attractive. A France, an Italy, a Germany, even an England in our case, was needed to lift the thing.

The [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)#Final round|Asian final qualifying group for the 1994 World Cup]] featured two sets of militantly hostile neighbours: Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia; and North Korea, South Korea, and Japan. This was called the "group of death" for [[black humour]].<ref>

A similar quip was made of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 1|UEFA qualifying group 1 for the 1998 World Cup]]:
{{cquote|The toughest group in the World Cup qualifying competition is the Group of Death. For the 1998 qualifiers, group one takes the title with ease. Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia were drawn in group one. . . .  There was, mercifully, no Serb-dominated rump Yugoslavia drawn in the same group. But there was, as far as the others are concerned, the next worse thing: the Greeks. They share the Orthodox religion with the Serbs, and give them strong diplomatic support. Pity Denmark, the reigning European champions, who make up the group.<ref>{{cite news |page=1 |title=It's War: World Cup squares up for the battle of the Balkans |first=John |last=Mullin |work=The Guardian |date=13 December 1995 }}</ref>}}

Occasionally, alternatives to "group of death" are proffered.
