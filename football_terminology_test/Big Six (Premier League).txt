=== Origins ===
Before the 1980s the elite of English football would regularly fluctuate. Despite this, teams could go through lengthy periods of success, such as [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] winning the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] three times in a row between 1924 and 1926 and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] winning the [[European Cup]] consecutively in both [[1979 European Cup final|1979]] and [[1980 European Cup final|1980]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=20 September 2023 |title=EFL Rewind: Treble-winning Terriers on top |url=https://efl.com/news/2023/september/20/efl-rewind--treble-winning-terriers-on-top/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250202180432/https://www.efl.com/news/2023/september/20/efl-rewind--treble-winning-terriers-on-top/ |archive-date=2 February 2025 |access-date=6 June 2025 |work=[[English Football League]] |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Nottingham Forest's Double European Cup winners Hall of Fame |url=https://nationalfootballmuseum.com/halloffame/nottingham-forest-1978-1980/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250320013213/https://nationalfootballmuseum.com/halloffame/nottingham-forest-1978-1980/ |archive-date=20 March 2025 |access-date=6 June 2025 |work=[[National Football Museum]] |language=en-GB}}</ref> However, it was much rarer for teams to dominate the top positions over lengthy periods.

Manchester United finished first in five of the first seven seasons, and second in the other two. Following the appointment of [[Arsène Wenger]] as its head coach in 1996, Arsenal began to engage in higher levels of competitiveness with Manchester United, with the two clubs dominating the Premier League's top-two positions between 1998 and 2003. As a result, they were recognized as the Big Two of the Premier League by mainstream media.<ref name="Goal-Walsh">{{Cite web |last=Walsh |first=Sean |date=24 January 2025 |title=The age of the Premier League's 'Big Six' is over – Man Utd & Tottenham's incompetence has left smaller but smarter clubs dreaming of Europe and the title |url=https://www.goal.com/en/lists/premier-league-big-six-over-man-utd-tottenham-incompetence/blt3ca8447a93dca797#cs750dc6c7d0cb1a48 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250315131645/https://www.goal.com/en/lists/premier-league-big-six-over-man-utd-tottenham-incompetence/blt3ca8447a93dca797#csc544a36789f2b5a0 |archive-date=15 March 2025 |access-date=11 March 2025 |work=[[Goal.com]] |language=en}}</ref><ref name="FFT" /> Manchester United won five league titles (1999–2000, 2000–01, 2002–03, 2006–07, 2007–08), while Arsenal secured two (2001–02, 2003–04).<ref name="Sky2024" /> Arsenal's unbeaten 2003–04 season led to the nickname "The Invincibles," the only team to achieve this in the Premier League era.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Platt |first=Oli |date=4 March 2021 |title=Arsenal Invincibles: How Wenger's 2003–04 Gunners went a season without defeat |url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-invincibles-how-wengers-2003-04-gunners-went-a-season-without-defeat/1xkm3tgyvsbjj1wzrewhqz0liu |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250311230236/https://www.goal.com/en/news/arsenal-invincibles-how-wengers-2003-04-gunners-went-a-season-without-defeat/1xkm3tgyvsbjj1wzrewhqz0liu |archive-date=11 March 2025 |access-date=26 March 2025 |work=[[Goal.com]] |language=en}}</ref>

=== Emergence of the Big Four (2000s) ===
Liverpool began to challenge the Big Two from 2001, due to their "treble" win of the UEFA Cup, Football League Cup and FA Cup, along with its striker Michael Owen winning the [[Ballon d'Or]] the same year, in addition to the club finishing in the top six of the Premier League in the early 2000s consistently.<ref name="Goal-Walsh" /> However, the Big Two continued to dominate in the Premier League. The following year, Liverpool finished second, becoming the first club outside the Big Two since [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 1997 to finish in the top two of the Premier League, though the Big Two would dominate the top two places once more the following season. 

In 2003, Chelsea was bought by Russian businessman [[Roman Abramovich]], something which guided the club to improved performances and higher recognition. That, alongside Liverpool's increasing success, eventually formed a Big Four with Arsenal and Manchester United. Between 2004 and 2009, the Big Four dominated the top four of the Premier League, with Everton in 2005 being the only occurrence of a club outside the Big Four finishing in the top four during that time. From 2005 to 2012, the Big Four clubs appeared in seven of eight Champions League finals, with Liverpool, Manchester United, and Chelsea each winning one title, while Arsenal finished as runners-up in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mendola |first=Nicholas |date=11 March 2025 |title=List of UEFA Champions League past winners: year-by-year results, final locations |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/soccer/news/uefa-champions-league-winners-every-club-to-lift-the-european-cup |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250207155917/https://www.nbcsports.com/soccer/news/uefa-champions-league-winners-every-club-to-lift-the-european-cup |archive-date=7 February 2025 |access-date=26 March 2025 |work=[[NBC Sports]] |language=en-US}}</ref>
