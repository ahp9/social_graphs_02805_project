The '''Original Glasgow derby''' is the name for the old rivalry between crosstown Scottish [[association football|football]] clubs [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], both based in [[Glasgow]]. The two clubs are two of the most successful in the [[Scottish Cup]], and the rivalry between them was one of the more intense in the early years of Scottish football, before being overtaken by the [[Old Firm]] rivalry from the 1900s onwards. The highest [[Scottish Cup]] attendance figure for the fixture was recorded on 18 January 1930 at [[Hampden Park]] for the first round, when 95,722 fans attended. The two clubs met in the top flight for last time during [[1957–58 Scottish Football League|1957–58]], the final season before Queen's Park's relegation. The club retained their amateur status from their foundation in 1867 until 2019, which meant it was extremely difficult to compete at the highest level and the intensity of the derby dramatically declined after 1958 as the ''Spiders'' never returned to the top tier.<ref name=ageold>{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Andrew |url=http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/sport/rangers-v-queen-s-park-renewing-an-age-old-rivalry-1-2575574 |title=Rangers v Queen's Park: Renewing an age-old rivalry |publisher=The Scotsman |date=14 October 2012 |access-date=23 December 2020}}</ref>

On 20 October 2012, the old derby was revived again in league football after 54 years in the [[Scottish Third Division]] following Rangers' expulsion from the top flight in 2012 – the attendance figure for their first meeting was a world record for a fourth division match at the time as 49,463 fans were present at [[Ibrox Stadium]] to see fourth placed Rangers overcome early leaders Queen's Park 2–0.<ref name=rfcqp12>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20018521

The most recent meeting between the clubs was a Fifth Round [[Scottish Cup]] match played on 9 February 2025. Despite being the away team from a lower division, Queen's Park ran out 1–0 winners: a result described as both "One of the greatest shocks in Scottish football history"<ref name="Sky2025"/> and also "one of the biggest upsets in Rangers' history, up alongside Cup defeats to Berwick Rangers and Hamilton".<ref name="Independent2025"/>

==History==
===1875–1900: Early years===
A match between the two clubs officially came to records in an 1875 friendly to raise money for the victims of a huge fire in Bridgeton that had claimed many lives. After meeting in the final of the inaugural [[Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup]] in 1877, the first major competitive fixture between the sides was a [[1878–79 Scottish Cup]] quarter-final tie on 22 March 1879 at the [[Hampden Park (1873–83)|first Hampden Park]] with Rangers winning 1–0 and advancing to the semifinal. That game was nine years before [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] even came into existence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://beyondthelastman.com/2013/02/27/nostalgia-for-lost-glasgow-derbies/|title=Nostalgia For Lost Glasgow Derbies|author=Craig McCracken|website=Beyond The Last Man|date=27 February 2013}}</ref> In the 1879–80 season Queen's Park recorded their largest victory against their rivals in a Cup replay, dominating the match 5–1 on 27 September 1879 at the first Hampden in front of 5,000 spectators. The first match finished in a 0–0 draw a week earlier at Rangers' home at [[Kinning Park (sports ground)|Kinning Park]], in front of 7,000 fans. Two years later on 30 September 1882 Queen's Park would beat their rivals again by 3-2 in second round of the Scottish Cup at the first Hampden.

[[File:Robert Smyth McColl c1901.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Smyth McColl]] had two spells at Queen's Park and one at Rangers]]
In 1890 Rangers were part of the [[1890–91 Scottish Football League|inaugural league season]] in Scottish football and Queen's Park joined the league 10 years later in 1900, remaining there with some interruptions until 1958. But between 1895 and 1899 and the two clubs would face each other in the [[Glasgow Football League]]: Rangers won the title in 1896 and 1898 and Queen's Park in 1897. They also played against each other in the [[Glasgow Cup]]: in 1898<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qpfc.com/matchdetails/1898_99/rann1.htm|title=Glasgow Cup 1898|website=QPFC.com}}</ref> Rangers beat Queen's Park 4–0 in the final and the next year the ''Spiders'' took their revenge winning the local trophy with a narrow 1–0 victory.

Queen's Park started competing in the [[Scottish Cup]] from its first edition in [[1873–74 Scottish Cup|1873–74]] and proved the most successful team for the first three decades of Scottish football,<ref name=ageold/> winning the trophy 10 times. That success instantly made the ''Spiders'' one of the best supported football clubs in [[Glasgow]]. Rangers started competing in the Scottish Cup in [[1874–75 Scottish Cup|1874–75]] which for a second consecutive time finished with Queen's Park as the winners. The latter won the cup for the last time in [[1892–93 Scottish Cup|1893]], beating Celtic in the final. On the other hand the ''Gers'' won it for first time the following year in [[1893–94 Scottish Cup|1894]], overcoming Queen's Park in the semi-final after a replay, though it took them until [[1947–48 Scottish Cup|1948]] to reach 11 wins and surpass their old rivals' record (Celtic had done so by [[1924–25 Scottish Cup|1925]]).

===1900–1939: Division One===
From 1900 until 1939 the two teams would play every year against each other in the [[Scottish League Division One]] – with the exception of the [[1922–23 in Scottish football|1922–23]] when Queen's Park competed in the second division. Their first meeting in the top flight took place at [[Ibrox Park]] on 29 September 1900, with Rangers winning the match 3–2 in front of 16,000 spectators. On 22 October 1904 Rangers recorded their largest victory at the time beating their rivals home 5–0 in the league. Nevertheless in the [[1907–08 Rangers F.C. season|1907–08 season]] Queen's Park held Rangers to a 1–1 draw on 30 September 1907 in the first tied league game between the two, and on 2 November 1907 they won 3–1 at Ibrox for a first ever league victory in the derby.

[[File:Alan Lauder Morton.jpg|thumb|[[Alan Morton]] played over 200 times for Queen's Park and over 400 times for Rangers]]
After many years without a derby win Queen's Park would succeed with a victorious away performance on 10 March 1926 with a 2–1 scoreline, just their fourth league derby win at the time. They reached the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup in [[1927–28 Scottish Cup|1928]] but lost 2–1 to holders Celtic at Ibrox;<ref>[https://jimcraigcsc.wordpress.com/2014/03/24/if-you-know-the-history-24th-march-1928-celtic-2-queens-park-1-scottish-cup-semi-final/ If You Know The History – 24th March 1928 Celtic 2 Queen’s Park 1 Scottish Cup Semi-final], Jim Craig Celtic Supporter's Club, 24 March 2014</ref> they would have faced Rangers in the final, but instead it was an Old Firm affair (the ''Gers'' won 4–0 to lift the trophy for the first time since [[1903 Scottish Cup Final|1903]], the 25-year hiatus being almost as lengthy as that of Queen's Park at the time).<ref>[http://www.thecelticwiki.com/page/1928-04-14%3A+Rangers+4-0+Celtic%2C+Scottish+Cup The Scottish Cup. {{!}} Victory of Glasgow Rangers], The Times, 16 April 1928, via The Celtic Wiki</ref> They did meet in the 1932 [[Glasgow Cup]] final which attracted 50,000 fans to the stadium in a match that the ''Gers'' won easily, 3–0. The [[1938–39 Scottish Division One|1938–39 season]] was the last one before [[World War II]] with Rangers winning the title and Queen's Park finishing at the bottom of the table – but they were never relegated as there was no official football action the following year.

===1939–1946: Wartime===
During the World War II the two clubs faced each other in the [[1939–40 Scottish War Emergency League]], the [[Southern Football League (Scotland)|Southern Football League]], and the [[Southern League Cup (Scotland)|Southern Football League Cup]] from 1940 until 1946; Rangers won all three trophies several times. The league cup tournament was divided in groups of four and the two rivals met in the [[1944–45 Southern League Cup (Scotland)|1944–45 season]] when they faced each other in the semi-final match at Hampden which Rangers won 3–0 on 21 April 1945 in front of 70,000 spectators. They also met in the [[Summer Cup (Scottish football)|Summer Cup]].

===1946–1958: Post-war===
In 1946 the football action resumed officially but Queen's Park were relegated for a second time in its history in 1948. The Original Glasgow derby was resumed eight years later in the [[1956–57 Scottish Division One|1956–57 season]] with Queen's Park returning to the highest tier and playing in a memorable battle with Rangers which ended in a 6–4 victory for the [[Govan]] side, who went on to win the title.<ref name="SPFL">{{Cite web |url=https://spfl.co.uk/news/robb-enjoyed-being-thrust-into-1957-meeting |title=Robb enjoyed being thrust into 1957 meeting – Scottish Professional Football League |website=spfl.co.uk |date=28 December 2012|access-date=24 December 2020}}</ref><ref name=thriller>[https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/queens-park-legend-jimmy-robb-1507054.amp Queen's Park legend Jimmy Robb: I only played against Rangers in 1957 thriller after Johnny Valentine failed to show up], Alan Marshall, Daily Record, 27 December 2012 </ref> The last season the two teams competed in the top flight was in [[1957–58 Scottish Division One|1957–58]] with Queen's Park finishing bottom of the table and Rangers as runners-up. This was [[Alex Ferguson]]'s debut campaign with Queen's Park, and he would later join Rangers in 1967.

===1958–1992: Decline===
Following Queen's Park's relegation the derby lost its importance as [[Glasgow]]'s biggest fixture after the [[Old Firm]] matches. Their next meeting was in the [[1973–74 Scottish Cup]] when Rangers achieved their biggest victory ever against the ''Spiders'': 8–0. On 12 March 1983, the ''Gers'' won narrowly 2–1 at Hampden Park in the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup in front of 13,716 fans.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ocFAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7qUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1594%2C2692584 Jolly old Queen's refuse to lie down], [[James Traynor]], ''The Glasgow Herald'', 14 March 1983</ref> The two rivals still faced each other in the increasingly irrelevant [[Glasgow Cup]] during the 1980s. Their last meeting prior to Rangers' 2012 removal from the top tier took place on 20 August 1991 in the [[Scottish League Cup]] when they beat Queen's Park 6–0 at Ibrox in the second round of the competition in front of a crowd of 32,230 fans.

===2012–13: A brief revival===
In 2012, Rangers endured severe financial difficulties, and its [[Administration and liquidation of The Rangers Football Club plc|holding company was put into liquidation]] while the team had to apply for entry to the bottom (fourth) tier of the Scottish league. That development meant that the two old rivals would be in the same division for the first time since the 1957–58 season. Both would be fighting for promotion in the [[2012–13 Scottish Third Division]]. Another historical local club, [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]], was part of the league that season, bringing in a glimpse of the glorious past of Glaswegian football. On 29 December 2012 Queen's Park came close to their first draw against the ''Gers'' in 70 years (since the 1932–33 season), but [[Fraser Aird]] scored in the 92nd minute to give Rangers a 1–0 win at [[Hampden Park]]. Overall, Rangers won all four fixtures against Queen's Park, finishing as champions while the ''Spiders'' qualified for the play-offs but failed to win promotion.

===2014–15 League Cup===
On 26 August 2014 Queen's Park hosted Rangers in the first round of the [[2014–15 Scottish League Cup]] at the [[Excelsior Stadium]] in [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire|Airdrie]] (Hampden was being used for the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] at the time). That season Rangers were competing just one level higher than their opponents as they attempted to climb back through the divisions of Scottish football (this was achieved after three promotions in four seasons). They managed to beat Queen's Park 2–1 and advanced to the semi-final, where they lost to Celtic.

===2024–25 Scottish Cup: A historic upset===
On 9 February 2025, Rangers hosted Queen's Park at [[Ibrox Stadium]] in the fifth round of the [[2024–25 Scottish Cup]]. In the shock of the tournament, a second half strike by Seb Drozd, a stout defensive performance from the ''Spiders'' and a last-minute penalty save by goalkeeper [[Calum Ferrie]] from [[James Tavernier]] gave Scotland's oldest team an 1–0 away victory and a spot in the quarter-finals for the first time in [[1982–83 Scottish Cup|42 years]].<ref name="Sky2025">{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/34782/13306284/rangers-0-1-queens-park-seb-drozd-and-calum-ferrie-the-heroes-as-rangers-dumped-out-of-scottish-cup-after-shock-ibrox-loss |title=Rangers 0-1 Queen's Park: Seb Drozd and Calum Ferrie the heroes as Rangers dumped out of Scottish Cup after shock Ibrox loss |publisher=Sky Sports |date=9 February 2025 |access-date=9 February 2025 }}</ref><ref name="Guardian2025">{{Cite news |last=Murray |first=Ewan |date=2025-02-09 |title=Calum Ferrie the hero as Queen's Park shock Rangers with win at Ibrox |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/09/rangers-queens-park-scottish-cup-fifth-round-match-report |access-date=2025-02-10 |work=The Guardian |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Rangers vs Queen's Park: Scottish Cup stats & head-to-head |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/crm71jddmp7t |date=2025-02-09|access-date=2025-02-09 |website=BBC Sport }}</ref> The result marked the first Scottish Cup victory for Queen's Park over Rangers [[1882–83 Scottish Cup#Second round|since 1882]],<ref name="Guardian2025"/> Rangers' first defeat against lower league opposition since their infamous [[Berwick Rangers F.C. 1–0 Rangers F.C.|loss to Berwick Rangers]] in the [[1966–67 Scottish Cup]], and the first home defeat to lower league opposition in the competition in their entire history.<ref name="Independent2025">{{Cite web |date=2025-02-09 |title=Queen's Park pull off seismic Scottish Cup shock as Rangers make 'unacceptable' exit |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/scottish/rangers-queens-park-scottish-cup-b2695024.html |access-date=2025-02-10 |website=The Independent }}</ref>

One year earlier, on 12 January 1929 the Original Glasgow derby attracted 60,000 who watched Rangers beat Queen's Park 4–0. On 21 April 1945, in a [[Southern League Cup (Scotland)|Southern League Cup]] semi-final during wartime, 70,000 flocked to the [[Celtic Park]] to watch Rangers beat Queen's Park 3–0 to advance to the final. In total, in at least nine games, the attendance was between 40,000 and 95,000, the most recent being in 2013 in the [[Scottish Third Division]]: on 20 October 2012, 49,463 fans revived the atmosphere of the old derby at [[Ibrox Stadium]], a figure that at the time was a world record for a fourth division match.<ref name=rfcqp12/><ref name=capacity/> When the two teams met in the [[1973–74 Scottish Cup]], their first cup meeting in 20 years Rangers easily beat second-tier Queen's Park at Hampden, still attracting 19,000 fans to the national stadium to watch the game.

==Finals==
The two old rivals have met in several final and semifinal games, from 1877 until 1957.

===Scottish Cup===
{{See also|List of Scottish Cup finals}}
The [[Scottish Cup]] was first played in [[1873–74 Scottish Cup|1874]] and Queen's Park were the inaugural winners, lifting 10 trophies between 1874 and 1893. Their decision to stick with amateurism and not turn professional meant that more success in the competition was impossible to come by. Nevertheless, it was over 40 years later, in 1936, that Rangers equalled the ''Spiders''' record (Celtic overtook it in 1925). The two clubs never played against each other in a final but they clashed in three semi-finals: Rangers beat Queen's Park to advance to the final in [[1878–79 Scottish Cup|1879]], [[1893–94 Scottish Cup|1894]] (in a replay) and in [[1932–33 Scottish Cup|1933]] (after two replays).

===Glasgow Cup===
{{See also|Glasgow Cup}}
Rangers beat Queen's Park in the finals of 1898, 1932, 1940 and 1985. On the other hand Queen's Park won the 1899 final against their rivals. In total, Rangers won 44 trophies and the ''Spiders'' 4, with their last one being in 1946.

===Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup===
{{See also|Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup}}
Queen's Park were also the first ever winners of the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup in 1877. They beat Rangers in the final on their first five meetings in 1877, 1878, 1880, 1881 and 1883. The next final they faced each other was in 1906. Rangers won that and the next 8 against Queen's Park, with the last being in 1957. In the 1922-23 Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup, Queen's Park reached the final against the ''Gers'' though they were playing in the second division that season. Overall, Rangers lifted the trophy 32 times and Queen's Park 8. The latter were the record holders for 31 years until 1908 when Celtic won their 9th. Between 1891, the year of their last trophy and 1957 they played in 18 finals, losing all of them.
