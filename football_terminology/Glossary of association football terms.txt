[[Association football]] (more commonly known as football or soccer) was first codified in 1863 in England, although games that involved the kicking of a ball were evident considerably earlier.<ref name="FAhistory">[https://archive.today/20050407161619/http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/TheOrganisation/Postings/2004/03/HISTORY_OF_THE_FA.htm "History of the FA"].

Retrieved 9 October 2007.</ref> A large number of football-related terms have since emerged to describe various aspects of the sport and its culture. The evolution of the sport has been mirrored by changes in this terminology over time. For instance, the role of an [[inside forward]] in variants of a [[Formation (association football)#Pyramid (2–3–5)|2–3–5]] formation has many parallels to that of an [[attacking midfielder]], although the positions are nonetheless distinct.<ref>Ponting, Ivan (11 February 2009).

In many cases, multiple terms exist for the same concept. One reason for this is the progression of language over time. The sport itself, originally known as association football, is now more widely known by the shortened term ''football'', or ''soccer'', derived from the word ''association''.<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/e-cyclopedia/2050053.stm "Soccer: A different ball game"] .

In Europe, where [[British English]] is prevalent, the achievement of not conceding a goal for an entire match is known as a [[clean sheet]].<ref name="cleansheet">Smith, Frank (29 November 2010).

Occasionally the actions of an individual have made their way into common football parlance. Two notable examples are [[Diego Maradona]]'s goals in [[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup)|Argentina's 1986 World Cup quarter-final win against England]]. After the match, Maradona described his first goal—a handball that the referee missed—as having been scored "a little bit by [[the hand of God]], another bit by the head of Maradona".<ref>Cassidy, Sarah (23 September 2004).

==Inclusion criteria==
This glossary serves as a point of reference for terms which are commonly used within association football, and which have a sport-specific meaning. It seeks to avoid defining common English words and phrases that have no special meaning within football. Exceptions include cases where a word or phrase's use in the context of football might cause confusion to someone not familiar with the sport (such as [[clean sheet]]), or where it is fundamental to understanding the sport (such as [[Goal (sports)|goal]]). Entries on nicknames relating to specific players or teams are actively avoided. Other phrases without entries are specific clubs, rivalries, media organisations or works, unless the name also has a more general meaning within football, as is the case with [[#E|El Clásico]] and [[#R|''Roy of the Rovers'' stuff]].

* '''[[12th man (football)|12th man]]''' – This expression has two different definitions. It usually refers to fans who are present at a football match, especially when they make such noise as to provide increased motivation for the team.<ref>Barkham, Patrick (2 March 2005). [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/mar/02/football.patrickbarkham "Delia overeggs the half-time crowd, but the Canaries fail to sing"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240713161819/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/mar/02/football.patrickbarkham |date=13 July 2024 }}. ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 20 May 2011.</ref> The metaphor is based on the fact that a team numbers 11 active players at the start of a game. The term can also be used where a referee is perceived to be biased in favour of one team. "They had a 12th man on the pitch", is a complaint made by fans. It also may refer to a player that's not usually part of the starting eleven, but comes off the bench most of the matches, a concept similar to the [[sixth man]] in [[basketball]].
* '''[[2–3–5]]''' – common 19th- and early 20th-century [[#F|formation]] consisting of two defensive players (previously known as [[#F|full backs]]), three midfield players ([[#H|half-backs]]), and five [[#F|forward]] players.

There are many variants of this formation, such as the 4–4–2 diamond, where the four midfielders are assembled in a diamond shape without wide midfielders, and the 4–1–3–2, where one midfielder is expected to adopt a defensive position, allowing the other three to concentrate on attacking.<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197518.stm "Formations guide"] .
