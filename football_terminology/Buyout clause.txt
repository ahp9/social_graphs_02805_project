{{Short description|Clause in a employment contract}}
A '''buyout clause''' or '''release clause''' refers to a clause in an [[employment contract]].  It allows the employee to terminate the contract unilaterally upon payment of a specified (usually substantial) fee to the employer.  The fee may be paid by the employee directly, but is more usually paid by a prospective employer who wishes to acquire the employee's services.

It is most commonly used in reference to sports teams, where a [[Transfer (association football)|transfer fee]] is usually paid for a player under contract; however, the current owning club is not obliged to sell their player, and if an agreement on a suitable fee cannot be reached, the buying club can instead resort to paying the player's buyout fee – should their contract have such a clause – which the owning club cannot block.<ref name=applied>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/3172294/how-release-clauses-work-neymar-treated-like-any-spanish-worker|title=How release clauses are applied: Neymar like 'any other worker' in Spain|date=5 August 2017|publisher=[[ESPN]]|access-date=9 August 2018}}</ref> Buyout clauses are usually set at a higher amount than the player's expected market value. However, on occasion, a player at a smaller club will sign a contract but insist on a low buyout fee to attract bigger clubs if their performances generate interest, which ''de facto'' functions as a [[reservation price]] set for the selling club.

The aim of this clause is twofold; firstly with its high amount, competing teams are discouraged from attempting to acquire the player if the current club shows no signs of selling them, and secondly it raises any hint to the players not to go through with their contractual commitment.

[[Football in Spain|In Spain]], buyout clauses have been mandatory in football contracts since 1985. If wishing to rescind their contract, the players are required to pay the buyout fee to their current club personally (via the [[Liga de Fútbol Profesional|league body]]), which would be advanced to them by the club signing them;<ref name=applied/><ref name=change/><ref name=vanguard/> however this advance of funds was originally deemed by the Spanish government to be taxable income, requiring the buying club to pay [[income tax]] on top of the fee itself, with the prohibitively high costs involved in this dual transaction discouraging clubs from making such deals.<ref name=change>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cityam.com/252013/recent-change-spains-tax-laws-could-make-buying-liga-manchester-united|title=A change in Spain's tax laws could make buying La Liga players easier for Premier League clubs such as Manchester United|date=22 October 2016|work=[[City A.M.]]|access-date=9 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=vanguard>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/08/spanish-buyout-clauses-work/|title=How Spanish buyout clauses work|date=2 August 2017|publisher=[[Vanguard (Nigeria)|Vanguard]]|access-date=9 August 2018}}</ref> In October 2016 the laws were changed, with the buyout fee advances to the players no longer subject to tax, meaning only the fee itself had to be paid.<ref name=change/><ref name=vanguard/>

As of January 2022, the six largest buyout clauses were those of association football players [[Karim Benzema]] and [[Federico Valverde]] of [[Real Madrid]], [[Pedri|Pedri González]], [[Ansu Fati]] and [[Ferran Torres]] of [[FC Barcelona]] (all €1 billion) and [[David Alaba]] (also Real Madrid, €850 million).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/20/real-madrid-extend-karim-benzemas-contract-and-insert-1bn-release-clause|title=Real Madrid extend Karim Benzema's contract and insert €1bn release clause|date=20 August 2021|work= The Guardian|access-date=25 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/the-neymar-effect-real-madrid-slap-astronomical-buyout/zd8ndsturtlw1jcarttg0zunc|title=The Neymar effect: Real Madrid slap astronomical buyout clauses on stars to avoid Barcelona's fate|website=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|access-date=2017-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/58989905|title=Ansu Fati signs six-year Barcelona deal with a 1bn buyout clause|work=BBC Sport |language=en-US|access-date=2021-10-21}}</ref>
