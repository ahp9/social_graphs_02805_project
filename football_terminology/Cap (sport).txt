In [[sport]], a '''cap''' is a player's appearance in a game at international level. The term dates from the practice in the [[United Kingdom]] of awarding a [[cap]] to every player in an international match of [[rugby football]] and [[association football]]. In the early days of football, the concept of each team wearing a set of matching shirts had not been universally adopted, so each side would distinguish itself from the other by wearing a specific sort of cap.

An early illustration of the [[1872 Scotland v England football match|first international football match]] between Scotland and England in 1872 shows the Scottish players wearing [[cowl]]s, and the English wearing a variety of school caps. The practice was first approved on 10 May 1886 for association football after a proposal made by [[N. Lane Jackson]], founder of the [[Corinthian F.C.|Corinthians]]:

The act of awarding a cap is now international and is applied to other sports. Although in some sports physical caps may not now always be given (whether at all or for each appearance) the term ''cap'' for an international or other appearance has been retained as an indicator of the number of occasions on which a sportsperson has represented a team in a particular sport. Thus, a "cap" is awarded for each game played and so a player who has played ''x'' games for the team is said to have been ''capped x'' times or have won ''x'' caps.

The practice of awarding a physical cap varies from sport to sport. It may be awarded before a player's debut or, particularly for national teams, a commemorative cap may be awarded after a player reaches the 100th cap.<ref>{{cite news|title=All Blacks century-makers: What it takes to crack 100|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11525788|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=9 October 2015|access-date=13 December 2016|archive-date=5 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305131809/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11525788|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Steven Gerrard memorabilia to be exhibited at Anfield|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/9850586/gerrards-anfield-exhibition|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=15 May 2015|access-date=13 December 2016|archive-date=5 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305061903/http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/9850586/gerrards-anfield-exhibition|url-status=live}}</ref>

Some men's association football teams still award physical caps.  Players are awarded one cap for every match they play – unless they play in a World Cup or European Championship finals tournament, then they are given a single cap for the competition, with the names of all their opponents stitched into the fabric of the cap itself.  For example, when [[David Beckham]] made his one-hundredth appearance for England, because a number of his appearances had been at World Cup and European Championship final tournaments for which he could only receive one cap, he received only his 85th physical cap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/soccer/2008/03/26/dont-tell-anyone-but-this-is-only-beckhams-85th-cap/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330185655/http://blogs.reuters.com/soccer/2008/03/26/dont-tell-anyone-but-this-is-only-beckhams-85th-cap/|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 March 2008|title=Don't tell anyone, but this is only Beckham's 85th cap|work=[[Reuters]] |access-date=20 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Jiuyou |url=https://jiuyougames.com/}}</ref> In Scotland, for many years the practice was to present caps only for appearances in the [[British Home Championship]], meaning that several players never received one (including those in their [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] squad); this anomaly was rectified retrospectively in the 2000s after pressure from players' families.<ref name=shine>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/nov/22/newsstory.sport7 |title=Tale of injustice that prompted a son to shine |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Paul Weaver |date=21 November 2005 |access-date=12 April 2020 |archive-date=12 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200412220805/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/nov/22/newsstory.sport7 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=__SwdvPyYN8C&dq=eddie+turnbull+cap&pg=PT8 Eddie Turnbull: Having a Ball] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230324102606/https://books.google.com/books?id=__SwdvPyYN8C&dq=eddie+turnbull+cap&pg=PT8 |date=24 March 2023 }}, Eddie Turnbull, Martin Hannan; Random House, 2012, {{ISBN|9781780574684}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DiEjAwAAQBAJ&dq=erich+schaedler+cap&pg=PT140 Shades: The Short Life and Tragic Death of Erich Schaedler] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230324102604/https://books.google.com/books?id=DiEjAwAAQBAJ&dq=erich+schaedler+cap&pg=PT140 |date=24 March 2023 }}, Colin Leslie; Black & White Publishing, 2013, {{ISBN|9781845027308}}</ref>

==Cricket==
{{See also|Cricket cap|List of Test cricket records#Individual records (other)}}

As in association football, [[cricket]] still awards a physical cap. Caps are awarded both at international and domestic level, however the criterion for winning a cap differs between international and domestic cricket.

In international cricket, a player is awarded a cap for every appearance made. It is common for a player to be presented with their cap in a ceremony on the first morning of their maiden [[Test cricket|Test match]], although a physical cap may not be presented for every occasion on which a player represents his country. International caps are numbered according to the number of players who have represented the country before. For example, cap number 50 is awarded to the fiftieth player to represent the country.{{ref|a}}

In some domestic cricket competitions, caps are also awarded. However, they are not awarded automatically for every appearance made, but instead at the discretion of the administrators of the club for whom the recipient plays, and are a one-off recognition that the recipient is now a regular, established player for the club. The most prevalent example of this system is in English<!--sic – do not change to "British"--> [[county cricket]], in which many [[First Class cricket|First Class]] counties award a "county cap" to players.

As of April 2021, 70 players have won 100 or more caps in Test cricket.{{cn|date=June 2024}}
