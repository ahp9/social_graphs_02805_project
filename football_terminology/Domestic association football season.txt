{{Short description|Period when association football is played}}
The '''domestic association football season''' in countries that [[association football]] is played [[Association football around the world|around the world]] varies in length and time of year contested. Most employ a single period in which the main league competition is contested alongside any cup competitions, although many Latin American leagues have two competitions contested in one season under the [[Apertura and Clausura]] system.

As a rule, the period of the domestic football season is ultimately dictated by the [[weather]], with most football games played on natural [[grass]] [[Association football pitch|pitches]] which are vulnerable to [[ice|freezing]] or becoming water-logged, although advances in [[artificial turf]] and pitch drainage/[[Under-soil heating|heating systems]] have improved pitch availability in many leagues.

In countries where association football competes with other football codes that are locally more popular, the season cycle can also be dictated by the scheduling of competing codes. [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS), which began in the [[United States]] and has since expanded into [[Canada]], has had to compete with [[American football]] from its inception, and now competes with [[Canadian football]] as well. When MLS began, most of its teams had to play in large American football stadiums that were used by teams in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) or [[college football]]. This led to scheduling the season to begin in spring and end in fall (autumn), which put the bulk of the season outside that of American football. Stadium conflict has now been reduced with the advent of [[soccer-specific stadium]]s. In [[Australia]], the two most popular football codes are [[Australian rules football]] and [[rugby league]], both of which are traditionally played in the Southern Hemisphere winter. Because all of the stadiums used by the [[A-League]] are also used for one or both of these two codes, that league chose to operate on a spring-to-autumn cycle, which placed most of its season outside those of Australian rules and rugby league.

The domestic season is preceded by a pre-season, in which clubs will require players to report back to the club by a set date to begin pre-season training, and will arrange [[Exhibition game|pre-season friendly]] games toward the start of the season to improve fitness and test team [[Formation (association football)|formations]] and [[Association football tactics and skills|tactics]], particularly if new playing staff have joined a club.

In many leagues, the dates of the domestic season dictate the opening and closing of a [[transfer window]], the periods when players can be [[Transfer (football)|transferred]].

The timing of a domestic season must be coordinated with international football competitions, which can see national teams with different domestic seasons playing each other at different times in their domestic season, although this can be less significant for certain countries where their best players, and hence the bulk of their national team, do not play in their international team's domestic league programme.

The world football governing body, [[FIFA]], which governs club as well as national football, mandates an international football calendar, whereby certain weeks in the year are reserved for national friendly and competitive matches, as well as regional club competitions. For dates which fall within a country's domestic season, league clubs are required to release any called up player for their international team a set number of days before a fixture. The date of the worldwide national team competition the [[FIFA World Cup]] is always in June/July, with the exception of the [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 Qatar edition]] which was played in November/December.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/25/2022-world-cup-qatar-fifa-dates-21-november-final-18-december 2022 World Cup Qatar: Fifa dates 21 November, final on 18 December]</ref>
