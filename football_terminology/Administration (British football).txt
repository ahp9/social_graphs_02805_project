In the United Kingdom, [[Association football|football]] clubs sometimes choose to enter [[Administration (law)|administration]] ([[sanction (law)|sanction]]) when they are unable to pay off outstanding [[debt]]s. Under the [[Insolvency Act 1986]], a business will face a winding-up order bringing them to court and if it is shown that a business cannot pay debts as they fall due or cannot repay outstanding debts then the company will be classified as [[UK insolvency law#Definition|insolvent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/123|title=Insolvency Act 1986 (c. 45) – Part IV Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts – Chapter VI Winding Up by the Court – Grounds and effect of winding-up petition|website=www.legislation.gov.uk |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]]|access-date=13 October 2013}}</ref> '''Administration''' puts accountants "in charge of pretty much everything apart from coaching the players and picking the team".<ref name="Administration"/> For a football club in administration, the "football creditors rule" requires football-related debts such as wages owed to players and staff, and transfer fees owed to other clubs to be paid first.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7741859.stm|title=Football clubs owe tax millions |last=Grant|first=Paul|date=23 November 2008|website=news.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC News|access-date=26 February 2010}}</ref>

In 2000, [[ITV Digital]] bought the broadcasting rights to [[The Football League|Football League]] and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] matches in a three-year, £315m deal.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} In March 2002, the company went bankrupt owing the League £180&nbsp;million which it said it "cannot afford to pay".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1896732.stm|title=ITV Digital goes broke|date=27 March 2002 |website=news.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC News|access-date=14 March 2010}}</ref> Because of this, many Football League clubs had financial problems and entered administration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1898021.stm|title=ITV Digital woes bring football crisis|date=28 March 2002 |website=news.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC News|access-date=14 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/oct/22/newsstory.sport|title= Crisis clubs|date=22 October 2002|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=13 October 2013 | location=London}}</ref>

Before the implementation of a points deduction it was perceived that clubs had "manipulated and abused [administration] as a way of shedding debts then restructuring, and borrowing again once the hapless creditors had been fobbed off with their 8p in the pound".<ref name="Administration">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/7305998.stm|title= Football administration|last=Farquhar|first=Gordon|date=20 March 2008 |website=news.bbc.co.uk/sport |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=26 February 2010}}</ref> In September 2003, it was proposed that clubs entering administration would be docked 10 points. A [[Fit and proper person test|'fit and proper persons' test]] was also introduced in an attempt to prevent fraudulent activities. If a person was previously director at a club which was in "administration twice during a five-year period" or at "two different clubs that have each gone into administration in a five-year period" then they would be prevented from becoming the controlling shareholder of a [[Football League]] club.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5030910.stm|title= The murky world of football finances|last=Summers|first=Chris|date=28 June 2006|website=news.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC News|access-date=13 March 2010}}</ref> A 'fit and proper persons' test was also introduced for directors of [[Premier League]] clubs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/12/66/0,,12306~91666,00.pdf#page=17 |title=The F.A.

To ease financial problems for clubs that had been relegated, "parachute payments" were introduced to give time to adapt to the financial gulf between divisions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/points-threat-to-clubs-choosing-administration-580968.html|title=Points threat to clubs choosing administration|last=Warshaw|first=Andrew|date=24 September 2003|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=26 February 2010 | location=London| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100409015315/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/points-threat-to-clubs-choosing-administration-580968.html| archive-date= 9 April 2010 | url-status= dead}}</ref> The deductions of 10 points in the [[Football League]] and 9 points in the [[Premier League]] were ratified in 2004, with the rule in place from the start of the 2004–05 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://breaking.tcm.ie/archives/2004/0115/sport/chairmen-to-agree-points-deductions-129765.html|title=Chairmen to agree points deductions|date=15 January 2004|newspaper=Breaking News|publisher=[[Thomas Crosbie Holdings]]|access-date=26 February 2010|archive-date=18 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718110904/http://breaking.tcm.ie/archives/2004/0115/sport/chairmen-to-agree-points-deductions-129765.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="PL">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jan/30/newsstory.sport14|title=Crisis clubs will lose nine points|last=Chaudhary|first=Vivek|date=20 January 2004|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=13 October 2013 | location=London}}</ref> The League also adopted rules that prevented any side from being in administration for either two successive seasons or eighteen consecutive months.<ref name="Wrexham"/> The reason for the deduction being a point less in the Premier League was that the teams play eight fewer fixtures than Football League clubs.<ref name="PL"/> The first club to incur this new penalty were [[EFL League One|League One]] side [[Wrexham F.C.]] who entered administration on 3 December 2004.<ref name="Wrexham">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4064257.stm|title= Wrexham FC in administration|date=3 December 2004|website=news.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC News|access-date=26 February 2010}}</ref>

[[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] filed for administration with only a few days remaining in the [[2006–07 Football League Championship|2006–07 season]], which automatically triggered a 10-point penalty. This placed Leeds at the bottom of the table and relegated the club, but they were extremely likely to have been relegated anyway. By entering administration during the 2006–07 season, they hoped to avoid starting the [[2007–08 Football League#League One|2007–08 season]] on −10 points. The following week, [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]] entered administration in the final minutes of a defeat to [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] which ensured they were relegated to the [[Football Conference]], meaning they likewise avoided starting the following season on -10 points (though they would find themselves being double-relegated to the Conference North for unrelated reasons).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/boston_united/6738469.stm |title=Boston suffer new demotion blow |website=news.bbc.co.uk/sport |date=10 June 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport }}</ref> The Football League saw both cases as clubs trying to exploit a loophole, and changed the rules. From 2007–08, any club entering administration after the fourth Thursday in March would have their 10-point deduction suspended until the following season. If the club is relegated the points will be deducted from their tally at the start of next season. If the club stays up the 10 points will be taken off their final total.

On 26 February 2010, [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] became the first Premier League club to enter administration.<ref name="Portsmouth"/>

===Football creditors rule===
In a situation of insolvency, the "football creditors rule" means that debts to other clubs or players are prioritised and must be paid in full before the club is eligible to compete again in the league.<ref name="Lawyer">{{cite web|last=Plainer|first=Adam|title=Paying by the rules|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/paying-by-the-rules/1003055.article|publisher=[[The Lawyer]]|access-date=31 May 2010|date=11 January 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100512172003/http://www.thelawyer.com/paying-by-the-rules/1003055.article| archive-date= 12 May 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The [[Enterprise Act 2002]] made reforms to the insolvency act and, from 15 September 2003, the altered procedures for administration were implemented.<ref name="Ent02">{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about the Enterprise Act: Company|url=http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/faq/faqeactc.htm|publisher=[[Insolvency Service|The Insolvency Service]]|access-date=31 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505053545/http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/faq/faqeactc.htm|archive-date=5 May 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Most notably it abolished the Crown's preferential right to recover unpaid taxes ahead of other creditors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Enterprise Act changes to be introduced in June|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-3501|date=24 April 2003|website=www.OUT-LAW.com|access-date=31 May 2010}}</ref> As such, [[HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) is now often not paid in full (between 2003 and 2010, outstanding unpaid taxes to the HMRC amounted to £30 million).<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|title=Crunched creditors call time on living the dream|first=Dave|last=Conn|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2010/feb/10/portsmouth-cardiff-hmrc-winding-up|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 February 2010|access-date=13 October 2013|location=London}}</ref> This legality of the football creditors rule was challenged in 2004 in ''[[Inland Revenue Commissioners v The Wimbledon Football Club Ltd]]''. However, it was found that "full payment to football creditors (out of third party funds) ahead of preferential creditors did not infringe the provisions of section s4(4)(a) of the Act" and "differential treatment may be necessary to secure the continuation of the company's business and may be regarded as supportable".<ref>{{cite web|title=Company Voluntary Arrangements |first=John |last=Verrill |url=http://www.dundas-wilson.com/publications/dw_cms_4894.pdf |publisher=[[Dundas & Wilson]] |date=1 September 2008 |access-date=31 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002071144/http://www.dundas-wilson.com/publications/dw_cms_4894.pdf |archive-date=2 October 2011 }}</ref>

In 2011 HMRC brought another challenge to the football creditors rule in the High Court, this time on the basis that it breached fundamental principles of insolvency law, including the [[pari passu]] rule that all unsecured creditors should be paid on a proportionate basis. However, in May 2012 the court rejected the challenge as it found that the rule was not a deliberate evasion of insolvency law.<ref>{{cite news|title=HM Revenue and Customs v The Football League Ltd [2012] EWHC 1372 (Ch)|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2012/1372.html}}</ref>

===Company voluntary arrangement===
Football clubs may also negotiate a [[Company voluntary arrangement]] (CVA). While not strictly the same as administration, the EFL regards a CVA as an insolvency event and imposes a 12-points deduction. Debts to football creditors also need to be settled in full, if league membership is to be retained.<ref name=BBC-25Jul2019>{{cite web|title=Bury: EFL warns club could be expelled if financial assurances are not provided |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49110053 |website=www.bbc.co.uk/sport |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 July 2019 |access-date=20 August 2019}}</ref> In July 2019, [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] owner Steve Dale agreed a CVA with creditors to avoid the club going into administration; the club were deducted 12 points ahead of the 2019&ndash;20 season,<ref name=BBC-25Jul2019/> but Dale's failure to provide the EFL with full details of the CVA led to Bury's opening fixtures being suspended ahead of a possible expulsion from the League.<ref name="BBC-15Aug2019">{{cite web|title=Bury: Shakers' fixture at Rotherham called off by English Football League |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49356357 |access-date=15 August 2019 |website=www.bbc.co.uk/sport |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 August 2019}}</ref> On 27 August 2019, the EFL announced that Bury's membership of the league had been withdrawn.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.efl.com/news/2019/august/bury-fc-membership-of-the-league-withdrawn/|title=Bury FC: Membership of the League withdrawn|website=www.efl.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref><ref name="BBC270819">{{cite web |title=Bury expelled by English Football League after takeover collapses |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49451896 |publisher=BBC |date=27 August 2019}}</ref> On 27 November 2020, Dale placed the club into administration.<ref name="Lord-27Nov2020"/>

Following the adoption of a points sanction in the [[The Football League|English Football League]], a similar rule was proposed for adoption by the [[Scottish Premier League]] (SPL) in December 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/3331583.stm|title=SPL debate administration penalty |date=18 December 2003 |website=news.bbc.co.uk/sport |publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=1 March 2010}}</ref> It was announced in January 2004 that SPL clubs going into administration in the [[2004–05 Scottish Premier League|2004–05 season]] would be subject to a 10-point deduction and be prevented from signing new players.
