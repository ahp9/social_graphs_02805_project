{{Short description|Golden generation of football players from Peru}}
The '''''Rodillo Negro''''' ''(Black roller)'' is the name given to a [[golden generation]] of [[association football|football]] players from [[Peru]] who represented [[Alianza Lima]] and the [[Peru national football team]] at domestic and international events. The period associated with this generation lasts throughout the 1930s up to the early 1940s. From a narrow view, the ''Rodillo Negro'' solely identifies Alianza Lima's [[Forward (association football)|forward line]]; from a broad perspective, the sobriquet applies to the whole squad and the players which reinforced it in the Peru national football team.
