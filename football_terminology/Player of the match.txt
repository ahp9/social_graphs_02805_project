In team [[sport]], a '''player of the match''' award (also known as '''man of the match''' or '''woman of the match''')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/man_of_the_match|title=man of the match - definition of man of the match in English - Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025173131/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/man_of_the_match|archive-date=25 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/woman_of_the_match|title=woman of the match - definition of woman of the match in English - Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|df=dmy-all}}{{dead link|date=September 2022|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> is often given to the most outstanding player in a particular match. This can be a player from either team, although the player is generally chosen from the winning team.

Some sports have unique traditions regarding these awards, and they are especially sought in championship or [[all-star game]]s. In Australia, the term "best on ground" is normally used, both for individual games and season-long awards. In some competitions, particularly in North America, the terms "[[most valuable player]]" (MVP) or "most outstanding player" are used. In [[ice hockey]] in North America, three players of the game, called the "[[three stars (ice hockey)|three stars]]", are recognised.

In sports where playoffs are decided by series rather than individual games, such as professional [[basketball]] and [[baseball]], MVP awards are commonly given for the series, and in ice hockey's [[National Hockey League|NHL]], for performance in the entire playoffs.

==Association football==
In football, the "man of the match" (MOTM) award goes typically (but not necessarily) to a player on the winning side. Players who score a [[hat-trick]], or [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] who keep a [[Shutout#Association football|clean sheet]] under pressure often get the award. Hat-trick scorers usually receive the match ball whether or not they are officially named player of the match.

The man of the match is often chosen by a television commentator or a sponsor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/27/sport.comment4|title=Football: The problem with man of the match awards|first=Si|last=Hawkins|date=27 February 2008|website=The Guardian|access-date=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301170032/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/27/sport.comment4|archive-date=1 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, not all competitions have an official player of the match award, so sometimes accolades are given by websites or newspapers instead. In the [[Premier League]], for example, a player receives a small black and gold trophy for their player of the match performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.premierleague.com/news/83956|title=How the Premier League's monthly awards work|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204082122/https://www.premierleague.com/news/83956|archive-date=4 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

When given informally (for example, by a columnist), the Man of the tournament tm may be "awarded" sardonically,  for example to the [[referee]] if the writer believes he influenced the result due to perceived incompetence.

==Australian rules football==
In [[Australian rules football]], the player of the game is often referred to as having been the "best on ground" (or "BOG"). Media outlets provide immediate, unofficial recognition that is largely honorary, often on a 5–4–3–2–1 or 3–2–1 voting basis.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Officially, the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] recognises the player of the game as being the player awarded the maximum three votes by umpires in the [[Brownlow Medal]] count at season's end. Exceptions are made during the season for certain reserved games such as the [[Western Derby]], [[The ANZAC Day clash]], [[QClash]], and [[Showdown (AFL)|Showdown]], where medallions are officially awarded in presentations following the conclusion of the match. On the day of the [[AFL Grand Final]], a player will be awarded the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as being the best on ground voted by an independent panel of [[Australian rules football]] experts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/stats/awards/norm-smith-medal|title=Norm Smith Medal - AFL.com.au|website=afl.com.au|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016135158/http://www.afl.com.au/stats/awards/norm-smith-medal|archive-date=16 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Cricket==
{{main article|Player of the Match awards (cricket)}}
In cricket, the man of the match award became a regular feature in Test matches in the mid-1980s.<ref name="test motm">{{cite web |url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283704.html |title=Records / Test matches / Individual records (captains, players, umpires) /Most player-of-the-match awards |work=ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=ESPN Sports Media |access-date=2 January 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303223723/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283704.html |archive-date=3 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The man of the match title is usually awarded to the player whose contribution is seen as the most critical in winning the game.

In one match held on 3 April 1996, the whole team from [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] was awarded the Men of the Match award. It was the first instance when a whole team was awarded it.<ref>{{cite web|title=4th ODI: West Indies v New Zealand at Georgetown, Apr 3, 1996 &#124; Cricket Scorecard &#124; ESPN Cricinfo|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64524.html|website=ESPN Cricinfo|publisher=ESPN|access-date=24 March 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404011441/http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64524.html|archive-date=4 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In a test match played 15 through 18 January 1999 between South Africa vs West Indies, the whole South African team was awarded man of the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63823.html|title=5th Test, West Indies tour of South Africa at Centurion, Jan 15-18 1999 - Match Summary - ESPNCricinfo|website=ESPNcricinfo|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106053428/http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63823.html|archive-date=6 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In Test matches, [[Jacques Kallis]] holds the record for the highest number of awards won, with 23 in 166 matches played.<ref name = "test motm"/> In ODIs, [[Sachin Tendulkar]] holds the record for the highest number of man of the match titles, with 62 awards in 463 matches played.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html |title=Records / One-Day Internationals / Individual records (captains, players, umpires) /Most player-of-the-match awards |work=ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=ESPN Sports Media |access-date=2 January 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304055509/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html |archive-date=4 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Tendulkar is followed by [[Sanath Jayasuriya]], who, along with [[Ricky Ponting]], also holds the record for the most Man of the Match titles as captain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Records / One-Day Internationals / Individual records (captains, players, umpires) / Most player-of-the-match awards|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902085726/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283705.html|archive-date=2 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the shortest form of the game, [[Twenty20 International|T20Is]], this record is held by [[Sikandar Raza]] who has won 17 awards.

==Gaelic games==
In the Gaelic games of [[hurling]] and [[Gaelic football]], the "man of the match" ({{Langx|ga|Laoch na hImeartha}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.focloir.ie/en/dictionary/ei/man+of+the+match|title=man of the match - Translation to Irish Gaelic with audio pronunciation of translations for man of the match by New English-Irish Dictionary|website=www.focloir.ie|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817205811/http://www.focloir.ie/en/dictionary/ei/man+of+the+match|archive-date=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> "hero of the game") is commonly awarded after important games. An unusual example was the [[2008 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship final]], where the award was given to [[Brian Cody]], the [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] manager, rather than to a player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoganstand.com/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=100900|title=Bookie pays out on man of the match bets - Hoganstand.com|website=www.hoganstand.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817204048/http://www.hoganstand.com/ArticleForm.aspx?ID=100900|archive-date=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In the women's sports of [[camogie]] and [[ladies' Gaelic football]], the term "player of the match" ({{Langx|ga|Laoch na hImeartha}}, "hero of the game") is used instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clarechampion.ie/fiona-scoops-player-of-the-match-award/|title=Fiona scoops player of the match award – The Clare Champion|website=clarechampion.ie|date=December 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817223801/http://clarechampion.ie/fiona-scoops-player-of-the-match-award/|archive-date=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickpost.ie/2017/02/14/ul-repeat-ashbourne-supremacy-ucc/ereena-fryday-receives-her-player-of-the-match-award-from-catherine-neary-1222017/|title=Ereena Fryday receives her player of the match award from Catherine Neary 12/2/2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817204538/http://www.limerickpost.ie/2017/02/14/ul-repeat-ashbourne-supremacy-ucc/ereena-fryday-receives-her-player-of-the-match-award-from-catherine-neary-1222017/|archive-date=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/shine-hails-impact-of-teen-star-odonoghue-36028640.html|title=Shine hails impact of teen star O'Donoghue|last=Cahill|first=Jackie|date=14 August 2017|publisher=independent.ie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2017/0812/896955-dublin-overcome-plucky-waterford-to-reach-final-four/|title=Dublin overcome plucky Waterford to reach final four|first=Jackie|last=Cahill|website=[[RTÉ.ie]]|date=12 August 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817204024/https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2017/0812/896955-dublin-overcome-plucky-waterford-to-reach-final-four/|archive-date=17 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Ice hockey==
{{main article|Three stars (ice hockey)}}
In North American [[ice hockey]], the three players who perform best in the game, often either those who accumulate the most points or outstanding goaltenders, are usually designated the '''three stars''' of the game: the top-performing player is the "first star", and so on. This tradition originated in the 1930s as a promotion for a "Three Star" brand of gasoline.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/top10/hockeygimmicks.html#threestars|title=Top 10 hockey gimmicks... or if you prefer, innovations.|archive-date=15 June 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615075333/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/top10/hockeygimmicks.html|date=15 June 2006}}</ref>

However, in international play (and outside North America), the ''three stars'' concept is rarely used. Instead, other leagues may issue awards to one player who performed best in the game.

Recently, in [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Stanley Cup Final]]. [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] designated for Most Valuable Player in the all Best-Player in the every Series

==Rugby football==
Both codes of rugby, [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]], commonly have man of the match or player of the match awards. In televised or sponsored matches, a commentator or sponsor often decides who gets the award, and it is presented to the winner after the match.

Examples of man of the match awards in professional men's rugby league are the [[Clive Churchill Medal]] in the [[National Rugby League Grand Final]], the [[Karyn Murphy Medal]] in the [[NRL Women's Grand Final]], the [[Lance Todd Trophy]] in the [[Challenge Cup]] final and the [[Harry Sunderland Trophy]] in the [[Super League Grand Final]].

==College basketball and college football==
In [[college basketball]] and [[college football]], the two collegiate sports with the most television coverage in the United States, a top player from each team is usually honoured as "players of the game." These athletes usually cannot collect material prizes due to [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] regulations. Instead, television companies broadcasting the game or corporate sponsors will often make donations to the scholarship funds of each school in the names of the winning players.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In college basketball's Final Four events, a [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]] award is given, for performance across both the semi-final and championship game. A Most Outstanding Player award is also given for each of the four regionals, based upon performances in the regional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen) and final (Elite Eight).

==Gridiron football==
The [[National Football League]] names an MVP for two prominent games on its schedule:
* A [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award]] has been awarded at each [[Super Bowl]] (the NFL's championship).
* The [[Pro Bowl]] has had an MVP award throughout its existence. The current Pro Bowl MVP format selects one offensive and one defensive player. From 1956 to 1971, two MVP awards were given, one to a [[skill position]] and the other to a [[lineman (American football)|lineman]] or [[linebacker]]. In 1972, an offensive and defensive MVP were named. From 1973 to 2012, a single Pro Bowl MVP was chosen.

Individual games typically have an informal player (or players) of the game chosen by the broadcast network covering the game; one prominent example of this phenomenon is the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day#Game MVPs|Turkey Leg Award, All-Iron Award and Galloping Gobbler]] trophies awarded for games held on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]].

The [[Canadian Football League]] awards two MVP awards for its championship game, the [[Grey Cup]]. The [[Grey Cup Most Valuable Player]] award is open to all players; the [[Dick Suderman Trophy]] is limited to players with Canadian citizenship or who were raised in Canada since childhood.
