[[File:2022 Hansi Flick (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|202px|[[Hansi Flick]] served as the interim manager of [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in 2019, following the resignation of [[Niko Kovač]]. He was eventually promoted to permanent manager.]]

In [[association football]], a '''caretaker manager''' or '''interim manager''' is somebody who takes temporary charge of the management of a [[football team]], usually when the regular [[Manager (association football)|manager]] is dismissed or leaves for a different club. However, a caretaker manager may also be appointed if the regular manager is suspended, ill, has a suspected [[contagious disease]] (e.g. [[COVID-19]]) or is unable to attend to their usual duties. Caretaker managers are normally appointed at short notice from within the club, usually the assistant manager, a senior coach, or an experienced player.

==Permanent appointments==
In Ireland, [[Charlie McGeever]] was twice appointed caretaker manager of [[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]] in separate decades (1984–85 and 1995–96) before being given the job on a permanent basis. As permanent manager he led the club to the [[1999 FAI Cup Final]], which they narrowly lost to an injury time penalty [[Rebound (sports)|rebound]] after a three-match marathon.<ref>{{cite news|first=Chris|last=McNulty|url=http://www.donegalsporthub.com/charlie-mcgeever-and-a-tale-of-cup-finals-world-cup-winners-and-ones-that-got-away/ |website=Donegal Sport Hub |title=Charlie McGeever and a tale of Cup finals, World Cup winners – and ones that got away|date=3 May 2020|access-date=3 May 2020|quote=McGeever, at 24, was installed as caretaker manager [of Finn Harps]… Just three days before Christmas in 1984, McGeever took charge of Harps for the first time.}}</ref>

In his two games as caretaker coach, he led Juventus to 3–0 and 2–0 wins over [[S.S. Robur Siena|Siena]] and [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] respectively, thus ensuring a second-place finish over rivals [[A.C.
