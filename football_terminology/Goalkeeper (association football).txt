The '''goalkeeper''' (sometimes written as '''goal-keeper''', abbreviated as '''GK''', '''keeper''', '''keeps''', or '''goalie''') is a [[association football positions|position]] in [[association football]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-10-26 |title=Definition of GOALKEEPER |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/goalkeeper |access-date=2025-11-05 |website=www.merriam-webster.com |language=en}}</ref> It is the most specialised position in the sport.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Quinn |first1=Michael |last2=Hirst |first2=Rebecca J. |last3=McGovern |first3=David P. |title=Distinct profiles of multisensory processing between professional goalkeepers and outfield football players |journal=[[Current Biology]] |date=2023 |volume=33 |issue=19 |pages=R994–R995 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2023.08.050 |pmid=37816326 |doi-access=free|bibcode=2023CBio...33R.994Q }}</ref> The goalkeeper's main role is to stop the opposing [[football team|team]] from [[Scoring in association football|scoring a 'goal']] (i.e. putting the [[football (ball)|ball]] over the [[Goal line (association football)|goal line]]). This is accomplished by the goalkeeper moving into the trajectory of the ball to either catch it or re-direct it away from the vicinity of the goal. Within the [[penalty area]], goalkeepers are allowed to use their hands, giving them (outside [[throw-in]]s) the sole rights on the field to handle the ball. The goalkeeper is indicated by wearing a different coloured [[kit (association football)|kit]] from their teammates and opposition.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-10-29 |title=goalkeeper |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/goalkeeper |access-date=2025-11-05 |website=dictionary.cambridge.org |language=en}}</ref>

The [[back-pass rule]] is a rule that disallows handling passes back to keepers from teammates in most cases. Goalkeepers usually perform [[goal kicks]] and also give commands to their defense during [[corner kicks]], [[direct free kick|direct]] and [[indirect free kicks]], and [[marking (association football)|marking]]. Goalkeepers play an important role in directing onfield [[Association football tactics and skills|strategy]] as they have an unrestricted view of the entire [[pitch (sports field)|pitch]], giving them a unique perspective on play development.

The goalkeeper is the only mandatory position of a team. If they are [[sports injury|injured]] or [[sent off (association football)|sent off]], another player must take their place. To replace a goalkeeper who is sent off, a team usually (but is not required to) brings on a substitute keeper in place of an outfield player to ensure they still play an outfield player down. If a team does not have a substitute goalkeeper, or they have already used all of their permitted substitutions for the match, an outfield player has to play as goalkeeper.

Because the position requires different skills from the outfielders, goalkeepers train separately from their teammates and often work with a goalkeeping coach to develop their play.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2802528-the-evolution-of-the-goalkeeper#slide1|title=The Evolution of the Goalkeeper: What Makes the Perfect Modern-Day No. 1?|website=[[Bleacher Report]]|access-date=16 August 2021|archive-date=26 December 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221226090219/https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2802528-the-evolution-of-the-goalkeeper#slide1|url-status=live}}</ref> While outfielders typically must be in good cardiovascular shape to play up to 90 minutes in a match, a goalkeeper must be able to move quickly and have fast feet for little bursts. During a match, goalkeepers may get a lot of action, usually in brief intervals, until their [[Team sport|teammates]] can clear the ball out of the zone. During practice, goalkeepers focus heavily on footwork and being able to get up quickly after a save is made. A goalkeeper must be able to get set, meaning feet shoulder width apart and on their toes, before the next shot comes their way, so they can react and make the save.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rebelo-Goncalves|first=Ricardo|date=September 2016|title=Assessment of technical skills in young soccer goalkeepers: reliability and validity of two goalkeeper-specific tests|journal=Gale Academic|volume=15|issue=3|pages=516–523|pmid=27803631|pmc=4974865}}</ref>

As with all players, goalkeepers may wear any [[squad number (association football)|squad number]], but the number 1 is almost always reserved for a team's first-choice goalkeeper, and the number 13 for the second-choice or backup goalkeeper.

The goalkeeper is notably the only position that is not included in formations. This is because the goalkeeper is the only non-outfielder position and the only compulsory position in football.

Though not essential, goalkeepers are typically tall players due to the height of the goal and the number of crosses, corners, and high shots in football.<ref name=":0" />

==History==
[[File:Footb incident painting.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A goalkeeper (left, wearing a white shirt) being charged by a rival player (1905)]]
Association football, like many sports, has experienced many changes in tactics resulting in the generation and elimination of different positions. Goalkeeper is the only position that is certain to have existed since the codification of the sport. Even in the early days of organised football, when systems were limited or non-existent and the main idea was for all players to attack and defend, teams had a designated member to play as the goalkeeper.

The earliest account of football teams with player positions comes from [[Richard Mulcaster]] in 1581 and does not specify goalkeepers. The earliest specific reference to keeping goals comes from [[Cornish Hurling]] in 1602. According to Carew: "They pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foot asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelve score off, other twayne in like distance, which they term their Goals. One of these is appointed by lots, to one side, and the other to his adverse party. There is assigned for their guard, a couple of their best stopping Hurlers."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/srvcr10.txt |title=The Survey of Cornwall by Richard Carew |access-date=1 February 2013 |archive-date=29 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134358/http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/srvcr10.txt |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other references to scoring goals begin in English literature in the early 17th century; for example, in [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]]'s play ''The Blind Beggar of [[Bethnal Green]]'' (performed {{Circa|1600}}; published 1659): "I'll play a gole at [[camping (game)|camp-ball]]" (an extremely violent variety of football, popular in [[East Anglia]]). Similarly, in a 1613 poem, [[Michael Drayton]] refers to "when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe". It seems inevitable that wherever a game has evolved goals, some form of goalkeeping must also be developed. [[David Wedderburn (writer)|David Wedderburn]] refers to what has been translated from [[Latin]] as to "keep goal" in 1633, though this does not necessarily imply a fixed goalkeeper position.

The word "goal-keeper" is used in the novel ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' (published in 1857, but set in the 1830s). The author is here referring to an early form of [[rugby football]]: {{blockquote|You will see in the first place, that the sixth-form boy, who has the charge of goals, has spread his force (the goal-keepers) to occupy the whole space behind the goal-posts, at distances of about five yards apart; a safe and well-kept goal is the foundation of all good play.<ref>{{cite book |page=112 |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.hwkq5n?urlappend=%3Bseq=126 |title=School Days at Rugby |author=An Old Boy [Thomas Hughes] |year=1857 |location=Boston |publisher=Ticknor and Fields|hdl = 2027/hvd.hwkq5n?urlappend=%3Bseq=126}}</ref>}}

The word "goal-keeper" appeared in the [[Sheffield Rules]] of 1867, but the term did not refer to a designated player, but rather to "that player on the defending side who for the time being is nearest to his own goal". The goalkeeper, thus defined, did not enjoy any special handling privileges.<ref>{{cite wikisource |author=Sheffield Football Association |authorlink=Sheffield Football Association |year=1867 |title=Sheffield Rules (March 1867)}}</ref>

The FA's first Laws of the Game of 1863 did not make any special provision for a goalkeeper, with any player being allowed to catch or knock on the ball.<ref>{{cite wikisource |author=Football Association |authorlink=Football Association |year=1863 |title=Laws of the Game (1863)}}</ref> Handling the ball was completely forbidden (for all players) in 1870.<ref>{{cite wikisource |author=Football Association |authorlink=Football Association |year=1870 |title=Laws of the Game (1870)}}</ref> The next year, 1871, the laws were amended to introduce the goalkeeper and specify that the keeper was allowed to handle the ball "for the protection of his goal".<ref>{{cite wikisource |author=Football Association |authorlink=Football Association |year=1871 |title=Laws of the Game (1871)}}</ref> The restrictions on the ability of the goalkeeper to handle the ball were changed several times in subsequent revisions of the laws:
* 1871: the keeper may handle the ball only "for the protection of his goal".
* 1873: the keeper may not "carry" the ball.<ref>{{cite wikisource |author=Football Association |authorlink=Football Association |year=1873 |title=Laws of the Game (1873)}}</ref>
* 1883: the keeper may not carry the ball for more than two steps.<ref>{{cite wikisource |author=Football Association |authorlink=Football Association |year=1883 |title=Laws of the Game (1883)}}</ref>
* 1887: the keeper may not handle the ball in the opposition's half.<ref>{{cite wikisource |author=International Football Association Board |authorlink=International Football Association Board |year=1887 |title=Laws of the Game (1887)}}</ref>
* 1901: the keeper may handle the ball for any purpose (not only in defense of the goal).<ref>{{cite wikisource |author=International Football Association Board |authorlink=International Football Association Board |year=1901 |title=Laws of the Game (1901)}}</ref>
* 1905: the keeper may not advance beyond his goalline when defending against a penalty kick.
* 1912: the keeper may handle the ball only in the penalty area.
* 1931: the keeper may take up to four steps (rather than two) while carrying the ball.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Football |page=3 |journal=Carluke & Lanark Gazette |date=19 July 1931}}</ref>
* 1992: the keeper may not handle the ball after it has been deliberately kicked to him/her by a team-mate.
* 1997: the keeper may not handle the ball for more than six seconds.

Initially, goalkeepers typically played between the goalposts and had limited mobility, except when trying to save opposition shots. Throughout the years, the role of the goalkeeper has evolved, due to the changes in systems of play, to become more active. The goalkeeper is the only player in association football allowed to use their hands to control the ball (other than when restarting play with a [[throw-in]]).

During the [[1935–36 in English football|1935–36]] English football season, young [[Sunderland AFC]] goalkeeper of the team, [[Jimmy Thorpe]], died as a result of a kick in the head and chest after he had picked up the ball following a [[backpass]] in a game against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Roker Park]]. He continued to take part until the match finished, but collapsed at home afterward and died in hospital four days later from [[diabetes mellitus]] and heart failure "accelerated by the rough usage of the opposing team".<ref name="Goalkeeper's Death">{{cite news|title=Goalkeeper's Death|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1936-02-14-16-001&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1936-02-14-16|location=London|work=The Times|date=14 February 1936|access-date=20 September 2019|archive-date=7 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230907134135/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The tragic end to Thorpe's career led to a change in the rules, where players were no longer allowed to raise their foot to a goalkeeper when he had control of the ball in his arms.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2006/10/04/soinve04.xml |location=London |title=On the run with dogs and a long-dead goalkeeper - Telegraph |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311055415/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fsport%2F2006%2F10%2F04%2Fsoinve04.xml |archive-date=11 March 2007 }}</ref>

=== Rules aimed at time-wasting ===
Due to several time-wasting techniques that were used by goalkeepers, such as bouncing the ball on the ground or throwing it in the air and then catching it again, in the 1960s, the Laws of the Game were revised further, and the goalkeeper was given a maximum of four steps to travel while holding, bouncing or throwing the ball in the air and catching it again, without having to release it into play. The FIFA Board later also devised an anti-parrying rule, saying that such deliberate parrying to evade the Law was to be regarded also as holding the ball.<ref name="Goalkeepers are not above the Law">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/news/y=1997/m=10/news=goalkeepers-are-not-above-the-law-72050.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106144044/http://www.fifa.com/news/y=1997/m=10/news=goalkeepers-are-not-above-the-law-72050.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 November 2015|title=Goalkeepers are not above the Law|publisher=FIFA|date=31 October 1997|access-date=19 July 2017}}</ref>

In 1992, the [[International Football Association Board]] made changes in the laws of the game that affected goalkeepers – notably the [[back-pass rule]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/law/summary.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011144333/http://fifa.com/classicfootball/history/law/summary.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 October 2007 |title=From 1863 to the Present Day |publisher=FIFA |access-date=1 February 2013}}</ref> which prohibits goalkeepers from handling the ball when receiving a deliberate pass from a teammate that is made with their feet. This rule change was made to discourage time-wasting and overly defensive play after the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] which was described as exceedingly dull, rife with back-passing and goalkeepers holding the ball. Also, goalkeepers would frequently drop the ball and dribble it around, only to pick it up again once opponents came closer to put them under pressure, a typical time-wasting technique. Therefore, another rule was introduced at the same time as the back-pass rule. This rule prohibits goalkeepers from handling the ball again once the ball is released for play; an offense results in an indirect free kick to the opposition. Furthermore, any player negating the spirit of the new rule would be likely to be cautioned for unsporting behaviour and punished by an indirect free-kick.<ref name="Goalkeepers are not above the Law"/>

On 1 July 1997, FIFA decided to extend the back-pass rule by applying it also to throw-ins from [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] to their goalkeeper.To prevent further time-wasting, FIFA also established that if a goalkeeper holds the ball for more than six seconds the referee must adjudge this as time-wasting and award an indirect free-kick to the opposing team. In practice, this rule is rarely enforced: a 2019 study of 45 [[Bundesliga]] matches found the goalkeepers violating it in 38.4% of instances of ball handling, none of which were penalised.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kolbinger |first1=Otto |last2=Stöckl |first2=Michael |date=2019-04-18 |title=Misbehavior During Penalty Kicks and Goalkeepers Holding the Ball Too Long as Trivial Offenses in Football |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=10 |article-number=844 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00844 |doi-access=free |issn=1664-1078 |pmc=6482224 |pmid=31057465}}</ref> An example of this rule being enforced in a high-profile match was at the London [[2012 Summer Olympics]] [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's tournament|Women's Football]] semi-final game between the United States and Canada.

The indirect free kick resulted in a penalty being called for a handball offence, which was scored to make it 3–3 and take the game to extra time, where the United States won the game 4–3.<ref name="Six second rule violation pivotal in the U.S. win at the Olympics">{{cite web|url=https://soccerrefereeusa.com/2019/01/05/six-second-rule-violation-pivotal-in-the-u-s-win-at-the-olympics/|title=Six second rule violation pivotal in the U.S. win at the Olympics|publisher=SoccerRefereeUSA.com|date=5 January 2019|access-date=22 March 2020|archive-date=20 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200920194547/https://soccerrefereeusa.com/2019/01/05/six-second-rule-violation-pivotal-in-the-u-s-win-at-the-olympics/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Laws of the Game and general play==
[[File:Suarez Ajax captain.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maksym Koval (footballer)|Maksym Koval]] (left) closes down [[Luis Suárez]].]]
The position of goalkeeper is the only position in the game that is technically distinct from the others in the course of normal play. The [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] distinguish the goalkeeper from the other players in several ways, most significantly exempting them from the prohibition on handling the ball, though only within their penalty area.<ref name="laws" /> Once a goalkeeper has control of the ball in their hands, opponents are not permitted to challenge them.<ref name="laws" /> Goalkeepers have a specialized role as the sole defender against a [[penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]].<ref name="laws" /> Goalkeepers are required to wear distinct colors from other players and are permitted to wear caps and tracksuit bottoms.<ref name="laws">{{cite web|title=Laws|url=http://www.theifab.com/laws|website=International Football Association Board {{!}} IFAB|publisher=[[International Football Association Board]]|access-date=8 February 2018|archive-date=16 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210416141341/https://www.theifab.com/laws|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Laws mandate that one player on the team must be designated as the goalkeeper at all times, meaning that if a goalkeeper is [[Sent off (association football)|sent off]] or injured and unable to continue, another player must assume the goalkeeper position.<ref name="laws" /> The Laws allow for teams to change the player designated as a goalkeeper at stoppages in play,<ref name="laws" /> but in practice, this is rarely exercised.

The Laws place no restrictions on a goalkeeper leaving their penalty area and acting as an ordinary player, though generally, goalkeepers stay close to their goals throughout matches.

Goalkeepers routinely perform extension dives. To execute this, they push off the ground with the foot nearest to the ball, launching themselves into a horizontal position. At this point, the ball may be caught or parried away from the goal. In the latter case, a good goalkeeper will attempt to ensure that the rebound cannot be taken by a player of the opposing team, although this is not always possible.

Because goalkeepers can spend the majority of a match without much action they need very good concentration in the event of the opposition going on the attack at any one time. Goalkeepers also need good 'anticipation' meaning they can 'read' where the ball is going to go and react by moving before the ball is kicked or headed and quickly decide whether to catch, punch or palm the ball.

==Responsibilities==
[[File:U20-WorldCup2007-Okotie-Onka edit2.jpg|thumb|Goalkeeper [[Destin Onka Malonga]] (right) making a save]]
The tactical responsibilities of goalkeepers include:
* To '''keep goal''' by physically blocking attempted shots with any part of their body. The keeper is permitted to ''play'' the ball anywhere on the field, but may not ''handle'' the ball using hands or outstretched arms outside of their penalty area.
* To '''organise the team's defenders during defensive set pieces''' such as free kicks and corners. In the case of free kicks, this includes picking the numbers and the organisation of a defensive player "wall". The wall serves to provide a physical barrier to the incoming ball, but some goalkeepers position their walls in certain positions to tempt kick-takers to certain types of shots. Occasionally, goalkeepers may opt to dispense with the wall. Some goalkeepers are also entrusted with the responsibility of picking markers while defending at set pieces.
* To '''pick out crosses and attempt long passes''' either by collecting them in flight or punching them clear if heavily challenged by opposing strikers.

Although goalkeepers have special privileges, including the ability to handle the ball in the penalty area, they are otherwise subject to the same rules as any other player.

Goalkeepers are not required to stay in the penalty area; they may get involved in play anywhere on the pitch, and it is common for them to act as an [[Defender (association football)#Sweeper (libero)|additional defender (or 'sweeper')]] during certain passages of the game. Goalkeepers with a long throwing range or accurate long-distance kicks may be able to quickly [[Playmaker#Playmaking in other positions|create]] attacking positions for a team and generate goal-scoring chances from defensive situations, a tactic known as the [[long ball]].

Other players who have been labelled "sweeper-keepers" in the media include [[Marc-André ter Stegen]] of [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Germany national football team|Germany]], Spaniard [[Víctor Valdés]], and the late [[Lev Yashin]], the latter of whom is often cited by pundits as one of the goalkeepers who pioneered the role of the sweeper-keeper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefalse9.com/2017/12/sweeper-keeper-role-tactics-explained.html|title=Football Tactics for Beginners- The Sweeper Keeper Explained|last=Burford|first=Harry|website=The False 9|language=en-US|date=24 December 2017|access-date=19 October 2019|archive-date=22 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022172128/http://www.thefalse9.com/2017/12/sweeper-keeper-role-tactics-explained.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Sweeper-keepers have been popularised by managers who usually employ tactics inspired by [[Total Football|total football]], such as [[Johan Cruyff]] and [[Pep Guardiola]], for example, and are chosen not only for their shot-stopping and goalkeeping abilities, but also due to their skill with the ball at their feet, their ability to pick out passes and contribute to the build-up play of their team, and their speed when rushing out of the penalty area to anticipate opponents, which enables their team to maintain a high defensive line. It is not without risk, as a goalkeeper being so far from the penalty area can lead to spectacular long-range lob goals if they or their team lose possession, as well as risking being red-carded if they run out to challenge an opponent but foul them or handball a shot by mistake.

====Goalscorers====
[[File:Rogério Ceni.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rogério Ceni]] is the highest-scoring goalkeeper of all time, with over 100 career goals.]]
Some [[List of goalscoring goalkeepers|goalkeepers have scored goals]]. Other than by accident when a long kicked clearance reaches the other end of the field and evades the opposing goalkeeper with the aid of strong winds and/or unexpected bounces, this most commonly occurs when a goalkeeper has rushed up to the opposite end of the pitch to give his team a numerical advantage in attack, leaving his own goal undefended. As such, it is normally only done late in a game at [[Set piece (football)|set-piece]]s where the consequences of scoring far outweigh those of conceding a further goal, such as for a team trailing in a knock-out tournament.

Some goalkeepers, such as [[René Higuita]], [[Jorge Campos]], [[Rogério Ceni]], [[Hans-Jörg Butt]] and [[José Luis Chilavert]], are also expert set-piece takers. These players may take their team's attacking [[Direct free kick|free kicks]] or [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalties]]. [[Rogério Ceni]], [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]]'s goalkeeper from 1992 to 2015, has scored 132 goals in his career, more than many outfield players.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/33006305|title=Rogerio Ceni: Sao Paulo keeper into club record books|publisher=BBC|date=4 June 2015|access-date=3 April 2016|archive-date=29 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329121044/https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/33006305|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120723041458/http://www.fifa.com/newscentre/features/news/newsid=1306860/index.html "They said it: Jose Luis Chilavert"].

Most goalkeepers also wear [[Goalkeeper gloves|gloves]] to improve their grip on the ball, and to protect themselves from injury. Some gloves now include rigid plastic spines down each finger to help prevent injuries such as jammed, fractured, and [[sprain]]ed fingers. Though gloves are not mandatory attire, it is uncommon for goalkeepers to opt against them due to the advantages they offer.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} At [[UEFA Euro 2004]], [[Portugal national football team|Portuguese]] goalkeeper [[Ricardo (footballer, born 1976)|Ricardo]] famously took off his gloves during the quarter-final penalty shoot-out against [[England national football team|England]], knowing he was the next taker for his side.

Though rare, goalkeepers are permitted to wear visored headgear (such as a [[baseball cap]]) to minimize glare from bright sunlight, or a [[knit cap]] to insulate from cold weather, at any time if they elect to do so.

==Careers and injuries==

Goalkeepers have a very physically demanding job. They are the only players allowed to use their hands, except for throw-ins. Because of this, goalkeepers are often injured during breakaways, corner kicks, and free kicks since they put their bodies on the line. Several famous goalkeepers have been injured in ways their counterparts could not possibly sustain. For example, [[Petr Čech]] received a head injury after colliding with another player during a 2006 game; a couple of months later he debuted wearing a rugby-style headpiece, a practice that he would continue to follow for the rest of his career. However, some goalkeepers manage to avoid injury and continue to play, many not retiring until their late 30s or early 40s. Notably, [[Peter Shilton]] played for 31 years between 1966 and 1997 before retiring at the age of 47.

In general, goalkeepers can sustain any injury to which their outfield counterparts are vulnerable. Common lower and upper extremity injuries include [[Articular cartilage injuries|cartilage tears]], [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|anterior cruciate ligament tears]], and [[Sprain#Joints involved|knee sprains]]. On the other hand, goalkeepers rarely fall victim to fatigue-related injuries, such as [[Exercise-associated muscle cramps|leg cramps]], [[pulled hamstring]]s, and [[dehydration]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Burger|first1=Rob|last2=Fine|first2=Kenneth|title=Soccer Injuries|url=http://www.stopsportsinjuries.org/soccer-injury-prevention.aspx#common|website=Stop Sports Injuries|access-date=3 November 2015|archive-date=9 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109152006/http://www.stopsportsinjuries.org/soccer-injury-prevention.aspx#common|url-status=live}}</ref> Shoulder injuries can be caused by heavy contact with the ground and can cause significant long-term injuries as loss of the range of motion can cause a complete inability to do their job. [[Vedran Janjetovic]] suffered such a contact injury playing in an A-League match on 25 January 2019 after diving to make a save. After playing nine games on painkilling injections he underwent experimental surgery that required a two-and-a-half-year recovery and caused him to miss two entire seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dsf.newscorpaustralia.com/dailytelegraph/subscription/|title=Dailytelegraph.com.au &#124; Subscribe to The Daily Telegraph for exclusive stories|access-date=25 July 2021|archive-date=27 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210827123806/https://dsf.newscorpaustralia.com/dailytelegraph/subscription/|url-status=live}}</ref>
