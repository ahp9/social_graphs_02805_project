== History ==
In pure zonal defence, every midfielder and defender is given a particular zone on the field to cover. When a player moves outside his zone, his teammate expands his zone to cover the unmarked area. However, the ''catenaccio'' philosophy called for double-marking when dealing with strong players. ''Zona mista'' combined the strength of zonal marking with that of ''catenaccio''.

In ''zona mista'', there are four defenders. A [[Football (soccer) positions#Sweeper/Libero (SW)|sweeper]] is free to roam and assist other defenders. A fullback plays in both defensive and advanced position, typically on the left flank. The two stoppers, who started then to be called "[[centre back]]", mark their zones. In the midfield, there are a [[defensive midfielder]], [[centre midfielder]] and the [[playmaker]] (#10) and a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] who covers typically the right flank and sometimes acts as an additional striker. ''Zona Mista'' employs a two-prong attack. A [[centre forward]] plays upfront. A [[second striker]] plays wide to the left (a derivation of ''catenaccio''{{'s}} left winger) and drifts inside to act as a striker or to cover the playmaker when the playmaker drops into a defensive position.

The new Italian tactic came to dominate [[football in Italy|national football]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s and reached its height with the highly successful [[Giovanni Trapattoni]]'s [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] and the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] coached by [[Enzo Bearzot]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Escolas renovadas!

=== Tactical layout ===
In pure zonal defence, each player covers an area of the field; when a player moves outside that area, and when you move outside of this area, even fellow department shake to keep your team pretty short, and usually sided with the flexible and suitable for 4–4–2. However, if you have to deal with very skilled players, according to the Italian school, you'd rather have a man who acts in the area and one ready to fix any errors. ''Zona mista'' faithfully reproduces the defensive techniques and most of the formation of ''catenaccio''.

There is a sweeper, but because of the change in the offside rule, he must be very careful to move at the right time. At this stage, the sweeper can sometimes also become a playmaker, and lend a hand in the building phase. There are four defenders: clarification of the role of the free, it must be said that this is the fluidising left-back, having at its disposal the entire band, as it is the only cursor (over half the wing, which he controlled) . The other two markers were first called stoppers, later called centre backs; one is sometimes deployed back to even out the areas of the field covered.

In midfield, there was a half-back (''mediano''), a central midfielder (''mediano avanzato'') and a playmaker (''regista''), often called "the number 10", a concept which then spread, in practice a median-called "push", as it was not uncommon for advancing and would mark. Also in this department should be noted hairpin wing, wing to wing somewhere between offensive and an exterior; was in control of the other end (right), although, in some cases, it was considered an offensive player, often marked on the scoresheet, and then added a striker, who often changing of positions with the wing. In two-pronged attack, one usually used as support, the other added opposite wing (derivation of the left wing of the bolt), with a dash movement, regarded as a second striker, when a #10 half-toe when the playmaker became a defensive halfback (leaving the #10 the invention of the game, and stay longer covered in center field).

=== Positions and functions in field ===
As ''zona mista'' evolved from ''catenaccio'', the numbers for each position were closely linked to [[Squad number (association football)#Great Britain|British numbering]].

The table below exposes the squad positions and its numbers according to the British style often used in national league and cups as long as in international club competitions, including variant numbering.
