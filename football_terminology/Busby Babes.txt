The '''"Busby Babes"''' were the group of [[association football|footballers]], recruited and trained by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] chief scout [[Joe Armstrong (football scout)|Joe Armstrong]] and assistant manager [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]], who progressed from the club's youth team into the first team under the management of the [[eponym]]ous [[Matt Busby]] from the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s. The squad most associated with the name "babes" was that of the [[1957–58 in English football|1957–58]] season, many of whom died in the 1958 [[Munich air disaster]], and who, with an average age of 22, had been touted to dominate European football for the next few years.

The Busby Babes were notable not only for being young and gifted, but for being developed by the club itself, rather than bought from other clubs, which was customary then. The term, coined by ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' journalist Tom Jackson<ref>[http://www.aboutmanutd.com/man-u-history/busby-babes.html Manchester United history " Busby's babes (1950s)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429203602/http://www.aboutmanutd.com/man-u-history/busby-babes.html |date=29 April 2011 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2007/news/busby-babes-writer-has-died-aged-80/ 'Busby Babes' writer has died, aged 80]</ref> in 1951,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutmanutd.com/man-u-history/busby-babes.html |title=About Man Utd &#124; Busby's babes (1950s) |access-date=26 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429203602/http://www.aboutmanutd.com/man-u-history/busby-babes.html |archive-date=29 April 2011}}</ref> usually refers to the players who won the league championship in seasons [[1955–56 in English football|1955–56]] and [[1956–57 in English football|1956–57]], with an average age of 21 and 22 respectively.

Eight of the players – [[Roger Byrne]] (28), [[Eddie Colman]] (21), [[Mark Jones (footballer, born 1933)|Mark Jones]] (24), [[Duncan Edwards]] (21), [[Liam Whelan]] (22), [[Tommy Taylor]] (26), [[David Pegg]] (22) and [[Geoff Bent]] (25) – died in or as a result of the [[Munich air disaster]] in February 1958. [[Jackie Blanchflower]], 24 at the time of the crash, and senior player [[Johnny Berry]], 31 at the time of the crash, were injured to such an extent that they never played again. Berry was the senior player in the team by the time of the crash, having been signed from [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in 1951, by which time he was 25.

A few of the players in the team at this time had been bought from other clubs. One of them, goalkeeper [[Ray Wood]], was just 18 when he joined United from [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]] in 1949. Wood's successor in the first team, [[Harry Gregg]], signed in December 1957 from [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]], as the world's most expensive goalkeeper at the time, for £23,500. Taylor had been one of the most expensive players in English football when United paid £29,999 for him as a 21-year-old from [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] in 1953. Berry had already been at the club for two years when Taylor arrived.

Other notable "Busby Babes" include full-back [[Bill Foulkes]], wingers [[Kenny Morgans]] and [[Albert Scanlon]], forward [[Dennis Viollet]], wing-half [[Wilf McGuinness]], who later became manager of Manchester United, and forwards [[John Doherty (English footballer)|John Doherty]], [[Colin Webster]] and [[Eddie Lewis (footballer, born 1935)|Eddie Lewis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11742_6911675,00.html |title='Busby Babe' Eddie Lewis dies |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=3 May 2011 }}</ref> McGuinness and Webster were not on the plane when it crashed at Munich. Doherty had just been sold to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].

[[Bobby Charlton]], 20 at the time of the crash, retired from playing in 1975. He had left Manchester United two years earlier, and had continued playing as a player-manager of [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. As a player, he set the all-time goalscoring record for Manchester United and [[England national football team|England]]. It was later broken by another United player [[Wayne Rooney]]. Charlton's appearance record was unbroken for 35 years after his last game for United. His England record was not broken until 2015, when Rooney scored his 50th England goal. 

Bill Foulkes, who retired in 1970, was at the club when the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] was won in 1968. 

Harry Gregg left the club in the [[1966–67 in English football|1966–67 season]], signing for [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], who had signed [[Dennis Viollet]] from United five seasons earlier. [[Kenny Morgans]] moved to [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in 1961, having rarely played for United after the end of the 1957–58 season. [[Albert Scanlon]] was sold to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in November 1960. Wood was sold to [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] within a year of the Munich crash, having been unable to win back his place in the team from Gregg, leaving [[Old Trafford]] around the same time as [[Colin Webster]], who was sold to Swansea Town. 

Wilf McGuinness suffered a broken leg in a reserve match during the 1959–60 season and never returned to the first team. He stayed with the club as a member of the coaching staff, and spent 18 months as United's manager after the retirement of Busby in May 1969. Injury ended the career of John Doherty, who played his last game for Leicester City less than a year after United sold him to the [[East Midlands]] club.

[[Sammy McIlroy]] was born in Belfast and moved to Manchester United in 1969, making him Busby's final signing, and "the last of the Busby Babes".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.manchesterworld.uk/sport/football/manchester-united/sammy-mcilroy-autobiography-brought-back-emotional-memories-of-life-career-at-man-utd-northern-ireland-3625851|title=Sammy McIlroy: Autobiography ‘brought back emotional memories’ of life & career at Man Utd & Northern Ireland|website=ManchesterWorld|last=Plant|first=Michael|date=24 March 2022|access-date=4 July 2025}}</ref> [[Jeff Whitefoot (footballer)|Jeff Whitefoot]] has also been called "the last of the Busby Babes".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Harby |first1=Chris |title=Manchester United's oldest surviving player Jeff Whitefoot recalls his days with the Busby Babes, the Munich Air Disaster and winning the FA Cup with Nottingham Forest |url=https://www.stamfordmercury.co.uk/news/meet-jeff-the-last-of-the-busby-babes-9295903/ |access-date=28 January 2023 |work=Stamford Mercury |date=28 January 2023}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
The Busby Babes were first portrayed in the television film ''[[United (2011 film)|United]]'' (2011), which focuses on the relationship between [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]] ([[David Tennant]]) and [[Bobby Charlton]] ([[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]]), in the aftermath of the [[Munich air disaster]]. Although fellow Scot [[Dougray Scott]] played the role of [[Matt Busby]], Busby's son was reportedly disgusted with the depiction of his father, claiming that Busby was the first tracksuit manager, whereas in the film, this defining feature is given to Murphy.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-13181651 |title=Sir Matt Busby's son 'disgusted' at United TV film|publisher=BBC |date=24 April 2011 |access-date=25 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/8468244/Sir-Matt-Busbys-family-incensed-over-TV-portrayal-of-iconic-Manchester-United-manager.html |title=Sir Matt Busby's family incensed over TV portrayal of iconic Manchester United manager |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=24 April 2011 |access-date=24 April 2011}}</ref> Of the Busby Babes shown in the film, [[Eddie Colman]], [[Duncan Edwards]], [[Harry Gregg]], [[Mark Jones (footballer, born 1933)|Mark Jones]] and [[David Pegg]], are portrayed by [[Philip Hill-Pearson]], [[Sam Claflin]], [[Ben Peel]], [[Thomas Howes (actor)|Thomas Howes]] and Brogan West, respectively. ''United'' also depicted Jones as the club captain; in actuality, it was [[Roger Byrne]], who was omitted from the film.

The Busby Babes were next portrayed in the film ''[[Believe (2013 film)|Believe]]'' (2013), a semi-fictional story set in 1980s Manchester, in which an older Busby ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]) manages a boys' team in a local cup. The Busby Babes have a smaller role in the film, and are shown in flashbacks (as part of Busby's nightmares stemming from the Munich air disaster) and as a hallucination towards the film's climax.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/24/believe-review-brian-cox-man-united-matt-busby|title=Believe review – Brian Cox stars as Man United's Matt Busby|work=The Guardian|first=Mike|last=McCahill|date=24 July 2014|access-date=6 February 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/believe-film-review-721194/|title="Believe": Film Review|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Leslie|last=Felperin|date=July 25, 2014|access-date=February 6, 2025}}</ref> The following Busby Babes shown in the film included [[Geoff Bent]] (Lee Buckley), Roger Byrne (Daniel Shannon), Bobby Charlton (Daniel Swann), Eddie Coleman (Danny Leech), Duncan Edwards (George Gladstone), Mark Jones (Michael Jukes), David Pegg (Michael Ferguson), [[Tommy Taylor]] (Dean Bowman) and [[Liam Whelan]] (Matthew Leeming).

[[Fulwell 73]] produced a documentary film, ''Busby'' (2019), which covered Busby's time in charge of Manchester United. The film makes use of archival footage, as by this point, most of the Busby Babes had died.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50150999|title=Manchester United: Sir Matt Busby film tells 'one of the great football stories'|publisher=BBC|date=4 November 2019|access-date=6 February 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/08/busby-review-matt-man-u-manchester-united-munich-air-disaster|title=Busby review – Manchester United's great manager remains an enigma|work=The Guardian|first=Andrew|last=Pulver|date=8 November 2019|access-date=6 February 2025}}</ref> However, [[Wilf McGuinness]] and [[Jeff Whitefoot (footballer)|Jeff Whitefoot]] appear as talking heads, while Bobby Charlton appeared via voiceover.
