== Variations ==
French footballer [[Zinedine Zidane]] was known to use different variations of the Marseille turn. Instead of using his sole to drag the ball back in the move's first phase, Zidane sometimes used the inside of the foot, especially when performing the move while running at high speed.

The possible merits of this variation can be derived from the difference between stud-less training shoes and football boots with studs.The studs of football boots provide less contact area with the ball when compared to a stud-less shoe, thereby increasing the possibility of the move being unsuccessful.

[[Franck Ribéry]] and [[Aiden McGeady]] have also performed slightly modified versions of the spin. The modifications include dragging the ball behind their standing foot instead of to the side during the first phase, while in the third phase the outside of the boot is used instead of the sole.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcLNUADOQjM|title=McGeady turn|date=22 March 2007|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=17 January 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/09/the-joy-of-six-football-moves-named-after-players |title=The Joy of Six: football moves named after players |last1=Williams |first1=Tom |date=9 May 2018 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=22 February 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1918346-cruyff-turns-rabonas-panenkas-and-more-ranking-the-slickest-skill-moves#slide11 |title=Cruyff Turns, Rabonas, Panenkas and More: Ranking the Slickest Skill Moves |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=10 January 2014 |accessdate=22 February 2019 }}</ref>

== Uses and effectiveness ==
The maneuver is most effective when the opposing player approaches head on or from the side of the player's master foot.

The first drag back enables the player to retain control of the ball by removing the ball from the arc of the opposing player's tackle. The body spin positions the back of the dribbling player's body in between the opposing player and the ball to shield the ball.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobalgame.com/blog/?p=141|title=The Global Game: Left Wing (Crossing soccer with life)'Clases de baile' : Zidane's dance class takes final turn|publisher=theglobalgame.com|date=27 April 2006|accessdate=2007-07-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620174234/http://www.theglobalgame.com/blog/?p=141|archivedate=20 June 2007}}</ref>

The second drag-back changes the direction of the ball, and, when combined with the completion of the spin, allows for both player and ball to move in the same direction and hence gain momentum for a continued run or a shot.

When performed at speed, the maneuver is almost impossible to defend against as it incorporates a sudden change in direction with a continuous shielding of the ball.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://expertfootball.com/training/dribbling_360.php|title=The 360 Spin|publisher=Expert Football.com|date=2004–2007|accessdate=2007-07-04}}</ref> One tactic the defending player can call upon is to use his body to shove the dribbler off balance during the move. This may invite a foul called upon the defending player, depending on the referee's judgement. The reason players like Zidane and Maradona have been able to use it with a high success rate is due in no small part to their own considerable body mass, as well as their excellent balance.

The maneuver can also be used when the ball is going out of play away from the player. By using a lunging step for the first drag-back in the roulette, the player can prevent the ball from exiting the field of play and continue dribbling along the touchline in one fluid motion.
