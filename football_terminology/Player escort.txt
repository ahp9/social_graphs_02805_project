'''Player escort''' (also called '''match mascot''' or '''child mascot''') is a [[child]] who accompanies a [[football player]] entering the [[football pitch|pitch]]. Player escorts hold hands with the footballer while they walk in and stay with the player during the playing of the national anthem. The children are usually between 6 and 18 years old. In addition to assisting players, they often have duties such as carrying flags, helping the sideline ball crew and playing matches with each other. However today there are various reasons why players walk in with children. These include promoting children's rights campaigns, bringing the element of innocence to the game, fulfilling children's dreams or making profit off it, and reminding players that children are looking up to them.<ref name="the18">{{cite web |author=Ivan Anich |date=October 7, 2015 |title=Why Do Soccer Players Walk Out With Kids? |url=https://the18.com/news/why-do-soccer-players-walk-out-kids |website=The18 |access-date=June 7, 2025 |archive-date=August 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812184932/https://the18.com/news/why-do-soccer-players-walk-out-kids |url-status=live }}</ref> It also deters [[hooliganism]] or other forms of violence, as fans would be less likely to throw anything at players if they were with children. <ref name="the18"/>

==History==
This tradition emerged in Brazil, in the 1970s. The idea came from Ronan Ramos Oliveira, who at the time was public relations director at [[Clube Atlético Mineiro]]. On September 5, 1976, in a match between the clubs [[Atlético Mineiro]] and [[América Mineiro]], he suggested that children go to the field with the team's players. The interesting thing here is that, at the beginning, the selected children had to be lookalikes of a player. The action was also a strategy for more families to start attending the games. 

The UEFA Euro 2000 was one of the first major events where player escorts appeared with every footballer, replacing the previous practice where the players on the team linked arms with each other.<ref name="the18"/> In club games children are usually members of youth teams or contest winners.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.whoareyadesigns.com/blogs/news/49302724-why-do-football-players-walk-out-with-children|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160518144652/http://www.whoareyadesigns.com/blogs/news/49302724-why-do-football-players-walk-out-with-children|url-status= usurped|archive-date= May 18, 2016|title= Why Do Football Players Walk Out With Children?|website= whoareyadesigns|author= Felicia Clow|date= September 21, 2015}}</ref> Since 2002, [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] or [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] escorts are selected in a competition hosted by [[McDonald's]] and [[Lidl]] (for UEFA EURO 2024), sponsor of the event.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2010/m=6/news=the-mcdonald-player-escort-programme-1249418.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160622202843/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2010/m=6/news=the-mcdonald-player-escort-programme-1249418.html|url-status= dead|archive-date= June 22, 2016|title= The McDonald's Player Escort Programme|website= FIFA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.mcdonalds.co.uk/ukhome/Aboutus/Newsroom/news_pages/euro-2016-player-escort-annoucement-press-release.html|title= McDonald's Launches Search for UEFA EURO 2016™ Player Escorts|website= McDonald's|date= February 29, 2016|access-date= July 11, 2016|archive-date= July 4, 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180704034749/http://www.mcdonalds.co.uk/ukhome/Aboutus/Newsroom/news_pages/euro-2016-player-escort-annoucement-press-release.html|url-status= live}}</ref> 

Being a child mascot may or may not be free. Among [[FA Premier League]] clubs, some may charge £350-£600 depending on the fixture while others offer some free places through competitions and charities, and other clubs do not have a charge at all.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/18/premier-league-clubs-charge-600-children-mascots| title=Revealed: Premier League clubs charge up to £600 for children to be mascots| first=James| last=Riach| work=The Guardian| date=18 December 2014| access-date=16 July 2018| archive-date=4 September 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210904125003/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/18/premier-league-clubs-charge-600-children-mascots| url-status=live}}</ref>
