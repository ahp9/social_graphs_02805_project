[[Association football]] clubs around the world sometimes retire [[Squad number (association football)|squad number]]s to recognise players' service to the club, whether that be through their loyalty or quality.

== Background ==
[[File:Jersey of Diego Maradona.jpg|thumb|170px|Signed jersey worn by [[Diego Maradona]] during his tenure on Italian club [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], exhibited at the San Siro Museum of Milan. The number 10 he wore was retired by Napoli in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://caracol.com.co/radio/2000/08/24/deportes/0967096800_058566.html |title=Nápoli retira camiseta número 10 en homenaje a Maradona |trans-title=Napoli retires shirt number 10 in tribute to Maradona |date=24 August 2000 |website=[[Caracol Radio]]}}</ref>]]
This practice, long established in the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major North American sports]], is a recent development in football elsewhere, since squad numbers for specific players were not widely used until the 1990s. Before then, it was typical for players in the starting lineup to be issued numbers 1 to 11 by formation/position on a match-by-match basis, and substitutes to be numbered from 12 upwards, meaning a player might wear different numbers during the season if they were to play in different positions for tactical reasons, or simply not be a regular in the starting lineup.

In contrast, in the former [[soccer in the United States|American]] league the [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|North American Soccer League]], players wore permanent numbers since its inception in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nasljerseys.com/Rosters/NASL_Rosters.htm |title=NASL Rosters |website=nasljerseys.com}}</ref> Moreover, [[Pelé]]'s #10 was retired by the [[New York Cosmos (1970–85)|New York Cosmos]] during the farewell of the Brazilian star on 1 October 1977,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nycosmos.com/heritage |title=Heritage |website=New York Cosmos |access-date=30 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104030057/https://nycosmos.com/heritage |archive-date=4 January 2012}}</ref> becoming the first number ever retired in association football.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/slideshow/famous-retired-jersey-numbers-football |title=Famous retired jersey numbers in football |first=Yashvanth |last=Ram |date=5 February 2016 |website=Sportskeeda}}</ref>

[[Football in Mexico|Mexico]] was a pioneer country in the use of permanent numbers in football; these were adopted in the [[Liga MX|Primera División]] in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.marca.com/2014/11/08/futbol/futbol_internacional/mexico/1415455261.html |title=Los números 1 en México |trans-title=The numbers 1 in Mexico |first=Fabián |last=Torres |date=8 November 2014 |newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]] |language=es}}</ref>

Retiring a player's shirt number usually occurs after the player has left the team or retired. It honours a player who has meant much to his club, and no other player is permitted to use that number in the future. In some cases, such as those of [[Marc-Vivien Foé]], [[Davide Astori]], and [[Diogo Jota]], numbers have been retired to posthumously honour a player who died while still active. Also, Norwegian club [[Fredrikstad F.K.|Fredrikstad]] retired [[Dagfinn Enerly]]'s number following an on-pitch accident that left him [[paraplegia|paralysed]]. In Britain, only [[Bobby Moore]]'s, [[Jack Lester]]'s, and [[Jude Bellingham]]'s shirt numbers have been retired due to great service to the club as opposed to a tragic incident. Although it had not been officially retired, [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s No. 25 shirt had not been reissued by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] since he left the club in 2003 until re-issued to [[Moisés Caicedo]] in 2023.<ref name="Gorrie">{{cite web | last=Gorrie | first=Jonathan | title=Zola responds as Caicedo takes iconic shirt number at Chelsea | website=Evening Standard | date=16 August 2023 | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/caicedo-shirt-number-zola-chelsea-fc-2023-b1101129.html | access-date=16 August 2023}}</ref>

The [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] and [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] national teams have been prevented from retiring the numbers of [[Diego Maradona]] (10), [[Christian Benítez]] (11)<ref name=benitreinst>{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/soccer-friendlies-latam-idUKL3N0M33JT20140306 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208231243/http://uk.reuters.com/article/soccer-friendlies-latam-idUKL3N0M33JT20140306 |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 December 2015 |title=Soccer - Ecuador to reinstate Benitez's number 11 for World Cup |first=Rex |last=Gowar |date=6 March 2014 |work=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> and [[Marc-Vivien Foé]] (17), respectively, by [[FIFA]] rules dealing with squad numbers for Finals tournaments; in other competitions, qualifiers or [[Friendly match|friendlies]], national associations may assign numbers according to criteria of their choosing. Similarly, several clubs have been required to reissue retired numbers for continental club competitions due to squad numbering rules of continental confederations. For example, [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]]<ref>[https://www.orlandopiratesfc.com/news/orlando-pirates-caf-jersey-numbers Orlando Pirates CAF jersey numbers], 27 Nov 2018</ref> and [[CONMEBOL]] have such rules in their club competitions,<ref name=reglam21/> but [[CONCACAF]] does not.

Some South American teams (such as [[Universitario de Deportes]] and [[Flamengo]], and even Mexican teams invited for the occasions) occasionally had to re-issue their retired numbers for special cases due to CONMEBOL rules, which stated that shirts had to be numbered 1–25/30 in continental club competitions (such as [[Copa Libertadores]] and [[Copa Sudamericana]], among others), although nowadays clubs are not forced to number their players consecutively.

== Dedication to fans ==
{{More citations needed section |date=July 2015}}

=== Number 12 ===
Some clubs dedicate a number to their fans, and do not issue it to any player. The most common number for this practice is 12, from descriptions of the fans as "[[12th man (football)|the twelfth man]]". Clubs and teams that do not give the '12' to any player include:
