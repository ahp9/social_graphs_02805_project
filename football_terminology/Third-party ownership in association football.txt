'''Third-Party Ownership (TPO) in association football''' is the ownership of a player's economic rights by third-party sources. The third-party—which can be an agent such as a [[Sports agent#Association football|football agent]], an agency, such as a sports-management agency, a company, investors such as a hedge-fund, or a single investor—"takes ownership of all or part of the financial rights to a player".<ref name="mirror_TPO_2016">{{cite news |title=What is third-party ownership and how does it affect transfers?

The practice has also been widely used in football in South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil and Argentina, with a system of players, clubs, agents, teams, and investors involved. It is associated with football clubs with few financial options that face financial hardship, and are sometimes insolvent.<ref name="mirror_TPO_2016"/> By 2007, TPOs had become common practice in football in Portugal, Spain and Russia.<ref name="mirror_TPO_2016"/>

According to a 2007 article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' and academic articles,<ref name="auto"/> businessmen or other investors buy shares in the economic rights of young players and often cover the costs of their training and accommodation. In return they are entitled to a percentage of a player's future transfer fee.<ref name="theguardian_2007">{{cite news |last=Conn |first=David |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/21/newsstory.sport |title=Hammers face a pounding over third-party player agreements |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 March 2007 |accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref> A 2016 article in the ''[[Daily Mirror|Mirror]]'', explained how third-party owners may either purchase a percentage of a player's "economic rights" from the club, or even purchase a player's contract.<ref name="auto"/> Owning the contract allows the third-party owner to increase profits by "parking a player" at a club temporarily until the player's value appreciates, at which time he is sold to another club and the agent earns a percentage of the transfer fees.<ref name="mirror_TPO_2016"/>

In April 2015, [[FIFA]] announced the banning of third-party ownership, and specifically prohibited either clubs or players from entering into economic rights agreements with third-party investors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Third - party own ership of players' economic rights|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/footballgovernance/02/59/55/80/third-partyownershipofplayerseconomicrights-backgroundinformation_neutral.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124074109/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/footballgovernance/02/59/55/80/third-partyownershipofplayerseconomicrights-backgroundinformation_neutral.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 January 2016|website=FIFA.com|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref> The ban took effect on 1 May 2015. The [[European Parliament]] also announced a similar ban in European sports on 11 November 2015 following the passing of Rule 136 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure. In a written declaration, the European Parliament states that third-party ownership raises concerns over the integrity of competitions and introduces risks of criminal activities into sports.<ref>{{cite web|title=WRITTEN DECLARATION submitted under Rule 136 of the Rules of Procedure|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=WDECL&reference=P8-DCL-2015-0066&format=PDF&language=EN|website=Europa.eu|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref>

According to a 2015 ''[[Bloomberg News]]'' article, the [[Football Leaks]] uncovered secretive "financing practice for the global sport" with "one of the biggest firms investing millions in soccer-player futures".<ref name="Bloomberg_2015">{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-23/world-soccer-s-financing-secrets-revealed-in-leaked-documents |title=World Soccer's Financing Secrets Revealed in Leaked Documents |first=Tariq |last=Panja |date=23 November 2015 |accessdate=11 October 2017 |publisher=Bloomberg}}</ref>

One method of circumventing the 2015 FIFA ban is to utilise a [[floating charge]] over designated accounts where the proceeds of player transfers is paid into.<ref name="auto"/> This was notably used by [[FC Porto]].<ref name="auto"/>

==Regulations==

At its annual general meeting in June 2008, the English [[Premier League]] drafted new rules L34 and L35 to restrict third party ownership of players from the beginning of the 2008–9 season.<ref name="FFW_2009_heros">{{cite web |url=http://www.ffw.com/publications/all/articles/heros-or-villains.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309105529/http://www.ffw.com/publications/all/articles/heros-or-villains.aspx|archivedate=9 March 2012|title=Hero's or Villains? Third party ownership in the Premier League|publisher=[[Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP]]|date=5 May 2009|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref> However, the FIFA 'third-party' rules differ drastically from the Premier League, which creates substantial gaps in the enforcement of TPO.<ref name="auto"/> Premier League rules authorise financial institutions to hold player economic rights - which Maciel & Walton suggests, appears to be a contravention of the all-encompassing FIFA ban. In 2007 as reported in ''The Guardian'', The league's rule U18 had previously stated that the third parties were not permitted to "materially influence" a club's "policies or the performances of its teams".<ref name="theguardian_2007"/>

In October 2007 it was reported that Football's international governing body, [[FIFA]], was acting to ban 'third-party' ownership.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ledsom|first1=Mark|title=FIFA bans third-party ownership of players|newspaper=Reuters|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-30225820071030|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109014351/http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-30225820071030|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 January 2016|accessdate=6 November 2015|date=30 October 2007}}</ref> Article 18 of FIFA's Rules on the Status and Transfer of Players does restrict the practice, at least as far as a third party's influence is concerned, stating that: "No club shall enter into a contract which enables any other party to that contract or any third party to acquire the ability to influence in employment and transfer related matters its independence, its policies or the performance of its teams".<ref name="FFW_2009_heros"/>

In September 2014 UEFA announced they were going to tackle the issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/23/uefa-third-party-ownership-champions-league|title=Uefa plans rule change to clamp down on third-party player ownership|first1=Owen|last1=Gibson|first2=David|last2=Conn|date=23 September 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref> Later that month FIFA announced they would ban the practice.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29373456|title=Fifa to introduce ban on third-party ownership of players|work=BBC Sport|date=26 September 2014}}</ref> In July 2015 a Belgian court rejected an appeal against the banning of third-party ownership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/27/fifa-welcomes-legal-win-for-ban-on-third-party-own/|title=FIFA welcomes legal win for ban on third-party ownership|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] }}</ref>

By 2016, TPO was strictly forbidden in England.<ref name="mirror_TPO_2016"/>

==Criticism==

Third-party ownership became controversial in English football after the arrival at [[West Ham United]] of [[Carlos Tevez]] and [[Javier Mascherano]] from the Brazilian club [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]] in August 2006. One unidentified official called it, "an unedifying trade in young people that rips the heart out of clubs which try to develop players".<ref name="The sooner Kia Joorabchian leaves English football the better">{{cite news |last=Winter |first=Henry |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/manutd/5325892/The-sooner-Kia-Joorabchian-leaves-English-football-the-better.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316061321/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/5325892/The-sooner-Kia-Joorabchian-leaves-English-football-the-better.html |archivedate=16 March 2011 |title=The sooner Kia Joorabchian leaves English football the better |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=15 May 2009 |url-status=dead |accessdate=25 July 2010}}</ref>

[[Gordon Taylor (footballer)|Gordon Taylor]], chief executive of the [[Professional Footballers' Association]], said of third-party ownership: "It is like trading in human beings. And it's destabilising for outsiders to have a financial interest in players."<ref name="Profile: Pini Zahavi">{{cite news |last=Jackson |first=Jamie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/nov/26/football.features |title=Profile: Pini Zahavi, football's first and only super-agent |work=[[The Observer]] |date=26 November 2005 |access-date=12 July 2007}}</ref>

In April 2015 [[UEFA]] and [[FIFPro]] spoke out against the practise, stating it should be outlawed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32142699|title=Uefa & Fifpro urge Europe to outlaw third-party player ownership|work=BBC Sport|date=1 April 2015}}</ref>

By 2016, FIFA was attempting to tighten rules regarding TPO, which "has been described in some quarters as modern-day slavery."<ref name="mirror_TPO_2016"/>

==Defence==

Defenders of the practice said that it constitutes a way of sharing the burden of investment in a player. The 'super agent' [[Pini Zahavi]], himself associated with third-party ownership and the companies that invested in players, said: "In England they don't understand it at all. It's easier to buy a player who you are unsure about for £10m if you are sharing the risk with a partner. Now, if the player becomes top-drawer and is sold for £30m, then of course you may feel stupid only to own half. But if the player turns out to be merely average or a failure, if he cannot even be sold, you will say, 'Fantastic, the disaster was not only mine'. That's exactly the way it works."<ref name="Profile: Pini Zahavi"/>

The businessman [[Kia Joorabchian]], heavily involved in the third-party ownership of players, defended the arrangement, calling it "the South American model and a model that appears all over Europe".<ref name="Kia the fixer">{{cite news |last=Castles |first=Duncan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/05/sportfeatures.westhamunited |title=Kia the fixer |work=The Guardian |date=5 October 2008 |accessdate=27 July 2010}}</ref>

After the Premiership introduced rules against third-party ownership, lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont claimed that it was illegal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/15386863|title=Third-party owner rule not 'legitimate' - Bosman lawyer|access-date=27 October 2011|date=27 October 2011|first=John |last=Sinnott|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

==Examples==

===Corinthians===

In 2004 the [[Media Sports Investments]] fund, founded and headed by [[Kia Joorabchian]], purchased a controlling 51% of [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]] in a 10-year deal. In the wake of MSI's involvement a stream of new players arrived at the club, players who were engaged to play for Corinthians but whose economic rights were partly or wholly owned by the investment fund.  By 2006 MSI was listing as its investments not just Corinthians itself but also the players [[Carlos Tevez]], [[Marcelo Mattos]], [[Gustavo Nery]], [[Roger Galera Flores|Roger]], [[Javier Mascherano]], [[Carlos Alberto Gomes de Jesus|Carlos Alberto]], [[Sebastián Domínguez]], [[Mário Custódio Nazaré|Marinho]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929150634/http://www.mediasportsinvestments.com/ "Media Sports Investments website 30 Nov 2006"] Retrieved 2010-08-03.</ref> [[Rafael Moura]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/Esportes/Noticias/Futebol/Brasileirao/Serie_A/0,,MUL700391-9827,00-AGORA+NO+ATLETICOPR+RAFAEL+MOURA+SEGUE+REPRESENTADO+POR+KIA+JOORABCHIAN.html|title=Agora no Atlético-PR, Rafael Moura segue representado por Kia Joorabchian|date=25 July 2008|accessdate=29 July 2010|work=Globo Esporte|first=Leandro|last=Canônico|language=Portuguese}}</ref> and [[Nilmar Honorato da Silva|Nilmar]].
