In [[sport]]ing terminology, a '''youth system''' (or '''youth academy''') is a youth investment program within a particular team or [[Sports league|league]], which develops and nurtures young talent in [[farm team]]s, with the vision of using them in the [[first team (association football)|first team]] if they show enough potential.<ref>{{cite web |author=Damon Threadgold |url=http://inbedwithmaradona.com/journal/2016/6/30/team-england-the-fa-and-the-great-eppp-gamble |title=Team England, The Fa And The Great Eppp Gamble — Ibwm |website=Inbedwithmaradona.com |date=2016-06-30 |access-date=2017-04-09 |archive-date=2017-04-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407234731/http://inbedwithmaradona.com/journal/2016/6/30/team-england-the-fa-and-the-great-eppp-gamble |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/911-Youth-football/5203-stunted-growth |title=When Saturday Comes – Stunted growth |website=wsc.co.uk |date=2016-07-27 |access-date=2017-04-09}}</ref> In contrast to most professional sports in the United States where the high school and collegiate system is responsible for developing young sports people, most [[Football (soccer)|football]] and [[basketball]] clubs, especially in Europe and Latin America, take responsibility for developing their own players of the future.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/get_involved/4207962.stm | work=BBC News | title=Life at a football academy | date=2005-09-30}}</ref>

A subset of youth academies are referred to as elite academies, designated for teenagers and young adults. These academies typically have a higher cost of capital incurred for maintaining an optimal environment for practice as well as cups and other competitions that may be partaken.

Elite academies often have full time staff including but not limited to coaches, physiotherapists, office staff and other roles that assist in the operations of the academy. Rules of top academies are strict and unlike other association football clubs, most clubs will have strict travel rules and will not allow players to drive to and from matches on the same day if under the age of 21 due to fatigue levels and stress.

Underage players may sign youth contracts with the club or association that owns the elite academy. It is also common for elite academies to offer the ability to study in parallel with the academy training, such as is the case in for example the system of college sports in the United States. Schools may offer sports focused programmes in order to integrate their student experiences with the academies of affiliation.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A network-based ranking system for US college football |date=2005 |url=https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/2005/10/P10014/meta |publisher=IOP Publishing|doi=10.1088/1742-5468/2005/10/P10014 |last1=Park |first1=Juyong |last2=Newman |first2=M E J. |journal=Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment |volume=2005 |issue=10 |article-number=P10014 |arxiv=physics/0505169 |bibcode=2005JSMTE..10..014P }}</ref>

==Youth academies==
Youth systems attached exclusively to one club are often called youth academies. In a youth academy, a club will sign multiple players at a very young age and teach them football skills required to play at that club's level and style of football.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/football/features/newsid_3619000/3619144.stm | work=BBC News | title=Does United's future still lie in youth? | date=2004-09-02}}</ref> Clubs are often restricted to recruiting locally based youngsters, but some larger clubs such as [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Manchester United]], and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] have recruited foreign talent, leading to the formation of specialist recruiters such as the [[La Liga]] Youth Brokerage, which started in 2016.<ref>[http://www.laligayouthbroker.strikingly.com La Liga Youth Brokerage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226145905/http://laligayouthbroker.strikingly.com/|date=2016-12-26}}</ref>

Many of the larger [[football club (association football)|football clubs]] in [[Europe]] such as [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[Feyenoord]] in the [[Netherlands]], [[FC Barcelona]], [[Atlético Madrid]], and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in [[Spain]], [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting CP]], and [[FC Porto|Porto]] in [[Portugal]], [[Olympique Lyonnais]] and [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] in [[France]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in [[England]], [[FC Bayern Munich]], [[Borussia Dortmund]], and [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] in [[Germany]], among many others, are regarded as having some of the finest youth academies and have produced many players regarded as some of the best in world football. Other clubs, such as the [[Brazil|Brazilian]] teams [[Grêmio]] and [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]], [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] in Spain, [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]], [[Inter Milan]], and [[AC Milan]] of [[Italy]], and English clubs [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Watford F.C|Watford]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], while not as financially successful as others, have a world class academy. West Ham's youth academy is known as [[West Ham United F.C. Under-21s and Academy|The Academy of Football]], and has produced [[West Ham United F.C. Under-21s and Academy#Notable players|many English talents]] that have gone on to play with larger clubs in the [[Premier League]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2004/06/14/sfnrp14.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=West Ham in the nation's debt for grooming England talent | first=Robert | last=Philip | date=2004-06-14}}{{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Another example is lower league clubs who have produced high quality players through the academy and sold them to keep the club running. A prime example of this is [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] who have, under [[Dario Gradi]] and his staff, nurtured players into high quality players such as [[Danny Murphy (footballer, born 1977)|Danny Murphy]] and [[Dean Ashton]] and sold them.

An alternative name for a youth academy is "Centre of Excellence". In English football, these terms have distinct meanings and are licensed and regulated by [[The Football Association]] and [[The Football League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/RulesAndRegulations/Regulations/Postings/2003/11/Regs_ProgforExcellence.htm|title=Programme for Excellence|date=2003-11-06|publisher=The FA|access-date=2008-06-20}}</ref>

In 2020, [[Major League Rugby]] teams started forming youth academies.<ref name="urlUtah Warriors Co-Founder to build Liberty Boys Academy - djcoilrugby">{{cite web |url=https://djcoilrugby.com/2020/12/01/utah-warriors-co-founder-to-build-liberty-boys-academy/ |title=Utah Warriors Co-Founder to build Liberty Boys Academy - djcoilrugby |date=2 December 2020 }}</ref><ref name="urlToronto Arrows Announce 2020 Academy Athletes, Additional Program Details - Major League Rugby">{{cite web |url=https://www.majorleague.rugby/news/toronto-arrows-announce-2020-academy-athletes-additional-program-details/ |title=Toronto Arrows Announce 2020 Academy Athletes, Additional Program Details |website=Major League Rugby |access-date=2020-12-09 |archive-date=2021-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211019031032/https://www.majorleague.rugby/news/toronto-arrows-announce-2020-academy-athletes-additional-program-details/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="urlMLR Academies Can Be Anything, Which Is OK | Goff Rugby Report">{{cite web |url=https://www.goffrugbyreport.com/news/mlr-academies-can-be-anything-which-ok |title=MLR Academies Can Be Anything, Which Is OK |website= Goff Rugby Report |date=27 October 2020 }}</ref>

In the [[Soviet Union]], children-youth [[sports school]]s were used as youth systems. Financing of the Soviet youth system was conducted by clubs such as [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]], [[CSKA Moscow]], and other clubs, and also through major industrial Soviet state enterprises such as [[Yuzhmash|PA Yuzhmash]], [[Black Sea Shipping Company]], [[Izhevsk Mechanical Plant]], and other enterprises.

==Youth leagues==
While similar to youth academies, '''youth leagues''' are built into a club competition rather than an individual club. However, the teams that play in these youth leagues (called [[farm team]]s) are generally attached to a larger senior club. The purpose of these leagues is to give young players experience in proper competition against other players that they will most likely end up playing with or against. The [[Premier League]] in England is known for having a large [[Premier Academy League|youth league]] attached to its senior clubs. In the forthcoming season the [[A-League]] in Australia will begin its own youth league.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22668500-5001023,00.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Football Federation looks at national youth league | first=David | last=Davutovic | date=2007-10-30}}</ref>

Youth leagues are not just exclusive to football (soccer). The [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) has a youth league established underneath its senior league with no attachment to any senior club. The players that play in this competition are then chosen to play for senior clubs through the [[AFL draft]]. [[Basketball]] clubs in Europe follow the same format as their respective football (soccer) clubs, with youth tournaments in each country, as well as the [[Euroleague Basketball Next Generation Tournament]], where the top 32 [[under-18]] sides compete for the championship. [[Minor ice hockey]] and [[junior ice hockey]] serve an identical purpose for ice hockey and the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). Historically, hockey followed a similar model to association football in that professional teams owned junior teams to develop youth talent (examples including the [[Montreal Junior Canadiens]] and [[Toronto Marlboros]]) to which they would retain territorial rights; this system was phased out in 1967 in favor of a [[draft (sports)|draft]] system.<ref name="pro-am-pact">{{cite news|title=Sweeping Changes In Pro-Am Hockey Pact|date=August 19, 1966|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|page=22|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-aug-19-1966-1087023/}}{{free access}}</ref> To a certain extent, [[Little League Baseball]] serves a similar purpose for professional baseball, although the vast majority of development and recruitment comes at the high school level.

The [[National Football League]] operates two youth academies, one at [[Loughborough University]] in England and the other at [[A. B. Paterson College]] in Australia, with those academies designed mainly for international talent.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://www.nflacademy.com/ |access-date=2024-11-09 |website=NFL Academy |language=en-GB}}</ref> The majority of the NFL's players, along with those of the neighboring [[Canadian Football League]], are developed predominantly through the educational system, first with [[high school football]] and then [[college football]] (university football in Canada). Canada also has [[Canadian Junior Football League|its own junior football system]] similar to hockey's. Neither [[Major League Baseball]] nor the [[National Basketball Association]] have a youth system. Basketball players are typically developed and recruited straight out of high school, although the [[National Basketball Association]] requires at least one year out of high school to be eligible to play. [[College basketball]] is also a source of players for the NBA and other professional leagues.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://www.nflacademy.com/ |access-date=2024-11-09 |website=NFL Academy |language=en-GB}}</ref>

[[MLS Next]] (stylized in all caps) is a system of youth [[association football|soccer]] leagues that are managed, organized and controlled by Major League Soccer. It was introduced by the league in 2020. The system was introduced in mid 2020 and will be active{{update inline|date=November 2022}} for the first time during the 2020–21 season. It is a successor to the [[U.S. Soccer Development Academy]]. The system covers the under-13, under-14, under-15, under-16, under-17, and under-19 age groups.
