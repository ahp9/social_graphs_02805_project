Various [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|association football]] clubs located in [[East Anglia]] vie for being the '''Pride of Anglia''', an unofficial title celebrated by fans of the clubs involved. These clubs include [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]], [[Colchester United]], [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]]—although  by modern geographical reckoning, [[Essex]] is not considered part of East Anglia. 

Currently, only Ipswich can claim their club to be the Pride of Anglia under the two most widely-regarded methods for deciding the accolade, '''most recent league position''',<ref name="2024 season">{{cite web | url=https://www.tntsports.co.uk/football/championship/2023-2024/standings.shtml | title=TNT Sports is not available in your region }}</ref> and '''most recent result in the [[East Anglian derby]]''',<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/cz9j2g3ye8xt | title=Ipswich Town 3-1 Norwich City: Tractor Boys get first East Anglian derby win since 2009 | newspaper=BBC | date=5 Oct 2025 | accessdate=5 Oct 2025}}</ref> respectively.

==Description==
[[File:Colchester_Pride_of_Anglia_2007.jpg|thumb|right|Colchester Chief Executive, Marie Partner with "Pride of Anglia" trophy, awarded by [[Anglia Television]] in 2007. This the only time (on record) a reward has been bestowed on a club for achieving "Pride of Anglia" status]]

Professional [[association football]] teams from the ceremonial counties that make up [[East Anglia]] (i.e. the counties of [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]], [[Essex]] and [[Cambridgeshire]] in England) compete for this unofficial title. No actual official trophy or reward is awarded.

Winning the most recent [[East Anglian derby]] and finishing as the highest Anglian team in the league pyramid are the two main measures employed by fans/pundits etc. that decide who can claim this title. The main two football clubs vying for the title are [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] from Suffolk and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] from Norfolk. Both teams currently regularly compete in the top two tiers in the English football league and often find themselves in the same division, meaning at least two derby matches will be played during the season as league games, in addition to any cup / play-off games where the two teams may be drawn against each other.

Other league clubs from the region include [[Colchester United]], [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] and [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]]. These teams occasionally find themselves in the same league as Norwich and Ipswich and thus have the opportunity to claim the title for finishing highest in the league. In 2007, Colchester United finished in the highest league position in East Anglia and the club were (uniquely) awarded a special trophy by [[Anglia Television]] to mark the occasion.<ref name=trophy>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110807180855/http://www.cu-fc.com/page/News/0%2C%2C10424~1027289%2C00.html#continue U's gain Anglia acclaim], Colchester United FC, 2007-05-18.

==East Anglian derby==
{{main|East Anglian derby}}

When Norwich and Ipswich meet, the match is known as the '[[East Anglian derby]]', first played in 1902. The most recent encounter played on 5 October 2025 at [[Portman Road]] ended in a 3-1 victory to Ipswich. This win saw Norwich lose their unbeaten streak of over 15 years, originally dating back to April 2009.<ref name="derbylist">{{cite web | url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/norwich-city/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/Ipswich%20Town/ | title=Norwich City football club: Record v Ipswich%20Town }}</ref> 

In recent years, the fixture has sometimes been humorously called the 'Old Farm derby',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8006883.stm|title=Live – Premier League & FA Cup|last=Stevenson|first=Jonathan|date=19 April 2009|publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |access-date=19 April 2009}}</ref> a reference to the [[Old Firm]] derby played between rival [[Glasgow]] clubs [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]],<ref name=desp>{{Cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-32736327| work=BBC News | title = Norwich v Ipswich: Play-off clash reignites old rivalry | first = Richard | last = Haugh | date = 15 May 2015 | access-date = 26 February 2017}}</ref> and to the  [[Agriculture in the United Kingdom|prominence of agriculture in East Anglia]].

Another commonly employed measure for "Pride of Anglia", and one that encompasses all of the East Anglian teams, is the side finishing as the highest-placed East Anglian team in the [[English football league system]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.eveningnews24.co.uk/content/Sport/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=Sport&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=Sport&itemid=NOED01%20Apr%202007%2016%3A44%3A11%3A370 |title=Cureton tells fans good times are coming |access-date = 2007-04-20 |date=2007-04-01 |work=Norwich Evening News |author=Chris Lakey}}{{dead link|date=October 2010 |bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In the [[2023–24 in English football|2023–24 season]], Ipswich finished in the highest league position of all East Anglian clubs for the first time in some years.<ref name="2024 season"/> and will by default be the best in Anglia on league position until at least the end of the 2024-2025 season for being the only club from the region in the highest tier of English football. Ipswich Town defeated Norwich City in their most recent encounter in the 2025-2026 season, meaning they can now lay full claim to the Pride of Anglia title after a 15 year win hiatus.
