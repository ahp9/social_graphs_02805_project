In the [[sport]] of [[association football]], a '''defender''' is an [[Glossary of association football terms#O|outfield player]] whose primary role is to stop attacks during the game and prevent the opposition from scoring.

Defenders fall into four main categories: centre-backs, full-backs, sweepers, and wing-backs. The centre-back and full-back positions are most common in modern formations. The sweeper and wing-back roles are more specialised, often limited to certain formations dependent on the manager's style of play and tactics.

==Centre-back==
[[File:John Terry Didier Drogba'14.JPG|left|thumb|Centre-back [[John Terry]] (right) closely marks centre-forward [[Didier Drogba]].|234x234px]]

The centre-back (also known as a central defender or centre-half, as the modern role of the centre-back arose from the [[Midfielder#Centre-half|centre-half]] position) defends in the area directly in front of the goal and tries to prevent opposing players, particularly [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre-forwards]], from scoring. Centre-backs accomplish this by blocking [[Shooting (association football)|shots]], [[Tackle (football move)#Association football|tackling]], intercepting [[Passing (association football)|passes]], contesting headers and [[Marking (association football)|marking]] forwards to discourage the opposing team from passing to them. Centre-backs are often tall and positioned for their ability to win duels in the air. In the modern game, most teams employ two or three centre-backs in front of the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. The [[Formation (association football)#4.E2.80.932.E2.80.933.E2.80.931|4–2–3–1]], [[Formation (association football)#4.E2.80.933.E2.80.933|4–3–3]], and [[Formation (association football)#4.E2.80.934.E2.80.932|4–4–2]] formations all use two centre-backs.

In possession of the ball, centre-backs are generally expected to make long and pinpoint passes to their teammates, or to kick unaimed [[long ball]]s down the field. For example, a [[Glossary of association football terms#C|clearance]] is a long unaimed kick intended to move the ball as far as possible from the defender's goal. Due to the many skills centre-backs are required to possess in the modern game, many successful contemporary central-defensive partnerships have involved pairing a more physical defender with a defender who is quicker, more comfortable in possession and capable of playing the ball out from the back; examples of such pairings have included [[Carles Puyol]] and [[Gerard Piqué|Gerard Pique]] for [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]],  [[David Luiz]], [[Gary Cahill]], [[John Terry]] and [[Ricardo Carvalho]] with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Sergio Ramos]], [[Raphaël Varane]] or [[Pepe (footballer, born 1983)|Pepe]] with [[Real Madrid]], [[Diego Godín]] and [[José María Giménez]] with [[Atlético Madrid]] and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], [[Virgil van Dijk]] with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Nemanja Vidić]] and [[Rio Ferdinand]] with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], or [[Giorgio Chiellini]], [[Leonardo Bonucci]], and [[Andrea Barzagli]] with [[Juventus FC|Juventus]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/jan/19/nemanja-vidic-footballer-of-year|title=Judges have a blindspot when destroyers like Vidic play a blinder|work=The Guardian|last1=Bagchi|first1=Rob|date=19 January 2011|access-date=2 February 2017|archive-date=15 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191015121355/https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/jan/19/nemanja-vidic-footballer-of-year|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/13/giorgio-chiellini-italy-euro-2016|title=Giorgio Chiellini: 'I have a strong temperament but off the pitch I am more serene'|work=The Guardian|last1=Bandini|first1=Nicky|date=13 June 2016|access-date=2 February 2017|archive-date=26 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190726183427/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/13/giorgio-chiellini-italy-euro-2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Under normal circumstances, centre-backs are unlikely to score goals. However, when their team takes a [[corner kick]] or other [[Glossary of association football terms#S|set pieces]], centre-backs may move forward to the opponents' [[penalty area]]; if the ball is passed in the air towards a crowd of players near the goal, then the heading ability of a centre-back is useful when trying to score. In this case, other defenders or [[midfielder]]s will temporarily move into the centre-back positions.

There are two main defensive strategies used by defensive lines: the zonal defence, where each centre-back covers a specific area of the pitch; and man-to-man marking, where each centre-back has the job of tracking a particular opposition player. In the now obsolete man–to–man marking systems such as ''catenaccio'', as well as the ''[[zona mista]]'' strategy that later arose from it, there were often at least two types of centre-backs who played alongside one another: at least one man–to–man marking centre-back, known as the ''stopper'', and a free defender, which was usually known as the ''sweeper'', or ''libero'', whose tasks included sweeping up balls for teammates and also initiating attacks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/soccer-positions-explained-names-numbers-what-they-do-2579-786 |title=Soccer positions explained: names, numbers and what they do |publisher=bundesliga.com |access-date=15 May 2021 |archive-date=28 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210228222507/https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/soccer-positions-explained-names-numbers-what-they-do-2579-786 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Sweeper (''libero'')==

Austrian manager [[Karl Rappan]] is thought to be a pioneer of this role, when he incorporated it into his ''[[catenaccio]]'' or ''verrou'' (also "doorbolt/chain" in French) system with Swiss club [[Servette FC|Servette]] during the 1930s, deciding to move one player from midfield to a position behind the defensive line, as a "last man" who would protect the back-line and start attacks again.<ref name="L’evoluzione del libero">{{cite web |url=https://www.eurosport.it/calcio/levoluzione-del-libero-da-picchi-a-baresi_sto4809423/story.shtml |title=L'evoluzione del libero: da Picchi a Baresi |publisher=Eurosport |language=it |last1=Fontana |first1=Mattia |date=7 July 2015 |access-date=18 May 2020 |archive-date=26 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220926003108/https://www.eurosport.it/calcio/levoluzione-del-libero-da-picchi-a-baresi_sto4809423/story.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mogiel.net/EC/intertoto-history/background.php |title=Background on the Intertoto Cup |last=Elbech |first=Søren Florin |publisher=Mogiel.net (Pawel Mogielnicki) |access-date=14 May 2012 |archive-date=10 February 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020210130955/http://www.mogiel.net/EC/intertoto-history/background.php |url-status=live }}</ref> As coach of [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in the 1930s and 1940s, Rappan played a defensive sweeper called the ''verrouilleur'', positioned just ahead of the goalkeeper.<ref>Andy Gray with Jim Drewett.

During his time with Soviet club [[PFC Krylia Sovetov Samara|Krylya Sovetov Kuybyshev]] in the 1940s, Aleksandr Abramov also used a position similar to a sweeper in his defensive tactic known as the ''Volzhskaya Zashchepka'', or the "Volga clip". Unlike the ''verrou'', his system was not as flexible and was a development of the WM rather than the 2–3–5, but it also featured one of the half-backs dropping deep; this allowed the defensive centre-half to sweep in behind the full-backs.<ref name="pyramid">{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Jonathan |title=Inverting The Pyramid: The History of Soccer Tactics |date=2009 |publisher=Orion |location=London |isbn=978-1-56858-963-3 |pages=159–65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0dXDwAAQBAJ&q=rappan+four+defenders+verrou&pg=PA160 |access-date=25 May 2020 }}</ref>

In Italy, the ''libero'' position was popularised by [[Nereo Rocco]]'s and [[Helenio Herrera]]'s use of ''catenaccio''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/what-nereo-rocco-would-say-about-ac-milan-and-the-azzurri-88731 |title=What Nereo Rocco would say about AC Milan and the Azzurri |publisher=Calciomercato |date=21 November 2017 |access-date=24 February 2020 |archive-date=21 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121151406/https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/what-nereo-rocco-would-say-about-ac-milan-and-the-azzurri-88731 |url-status=live }}</ref> The current Italian term for this position, ''libero'', which is thought to have been coined by [[Gianni Brera]], originated from the original Italian description for this role ''libero da impegni di marcatura'' (''i.e.'', "free from man-marking tasks");<ref name="dizionario"/><ref name="Damele"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/calcio-la-storia-del-calcio_%28Enciclopedia-dello-Sport%29/ |title=La Storia del Calcio: Il calcio dalle origini a oggi |publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport (2002) |language=it |last1=Bortolotti |first1=Adalberto |access-date=18 May 2020 |archive-date=29 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129214730/http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/calcio-la-storia-del-calcio_%28Enciclopedia-dello-Sport%29/ |url-status=live }}</ref> it was also known as the "battitore libero" ("free hitter", in Italian, i.e. a player who was given the freedom to intervene after their teammates, if a player had got past the defence, to clear the ball away).<ref name="pyramid"/><ref name="tuttojuve"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/battitore/ |title=battitóre |publisher=Treccani |language=it |access-date=18 May 2020 |archive-date=17 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617140903/http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/battitore/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=L'Analisi Linguistica e Letteraria 2011-2 |journal=L'Analisi Linguistica e Letteraria: Pubblicazione Semestrale |date=2011 |publisher=Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore |issn=1122-1917 |page=232 |isbn=9788867808625 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLv4CQAAQBAJ&q=%22battitore+libero%22+intervenire&pg=PA232 |access-date=19 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Falco |first1=Giorgio |title=Sottofondo italiano |date=2015 |publisher=Laterza Solaris |location=Bari |isbn=9788858120750 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AnmODAAAQBAJ&q=%22battitore+libero%22+intervenire&pg=PT5 |access-date=19 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Veronell |first1=Maurizio |title=Caratteri, mentalità e dialettica dei sistemi di gioco nel calcio italiano |date=21 December 2016 |publisher=GDS |location=Milan |isbn=9788867825752 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1nNDQAAQBAJ&q=%22battitore+libero%22+intervenire&pg=PT113 |access-date=19 May 2020 |archive-date=5 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240905131609/https://books.google.com/books?id=j1nNDQAAQBAJ&q=%22battitore+libero%22+intervenire&pg=PT113#v=snippet&q=%22battitore%20libero%22%20intervenire&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> In Italian football, the ''libero'' was usually assigned the [[Squad number (association football)|number six]] shirt.<ref name="L’evoluzione del libero"/>

One of the first predecessors of the ''libero'' role in Italy was used in the so–called "''vianema''" system, a predecessor to ''catenaccio'', which was used by [[U.S. Salernitana 1919|Salernitana]] during the 1940s. The system originated from an idea that one of the club's players – Antonio Valese – posed to his manager Giuseppe Viani. Viani altered the English [[Formation (association football)#WM|WM]] system – known as the ''sistema'' in Italy – by having his centre-half-back retreat into the defensive line to act as an additional defender and mark an opposing centre-forward, instead leaving his full-back (which, at the time, was similar to the modern centre-back role) free to function as what was essentially a sweeper, creating a 1–3–3–3 formation; he occasionally also used a defender in the centre-forward role, and wearing the number nine shirt, to track back and mark the opposing forwards, thus freeing up the full-backs from their marking duties. Andrea Schianchi of {{lang|it|La Gazzetta dello Sport}} notes that this modification was designed to help smaller teams in Italy, as the man–to–man system often put players directly against one another, favouring the larger and wealthier teams with stronger individual players.<ref name="Nereo Rocco, l'inventore del catenaccio che diventò Paròn d'Europa">{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/02-11-2014/nereo-rocco-inventore-catenaccio-che-divento-paron-d-europa-milan-90920157724.shtml|title=Nereo Rocco, l'inventore del catenaccio che diventò Paròn d'Europa|work=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=it|author1=Andrea Schianchi|date=2 November 2014|access-date=5 November 2015|archive-date=25 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230425104515/https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/02-11-2014/nereo-rocco-inventore-catenaccio-che-divento-paron-d-europa-milan-90920157724.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=storiedicalcio.altervista.org>{{cite web|url=http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/rocco.html|title=Nereo Rocco|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=it|access-date=5 November 2015|archive-date=15 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915230950/http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/rocco.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://contropiede.ilgiornale.it/gipo-viani-linventore-del-vianema-che-amava-il-vizio-e-scopri-rivera/ |title=Gipo Viani, l'inventore del "Vianema" che amava il vizio e scoprì Rivera |work=Il Giornale |language=it |last1=Damiani |first1=Lorenzo |access-date=19 May 2020 |archive-date=17 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200817120517/http://contropiede.ilgiornale.it/gipo-viani-linventore-del-vianema-che-amava-il-vizio-e-scopri-rivera/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mondopallone.it/2013/04/08/piccola-storia-della-tattica-la-nascita-del-catenaccio-il-vianema-e-nereo-rocco-linter-di-foni-e-di-herrera-iv-parte/ |title=Piccola Storia della Tattica: la nascita del catenaccio, il Vianema e Nereo Rocco, l'Inter di Foni e di Herrera (IV parte) |publisher=www.mondopallone.it |language=it |last1=Chichierchia |first1=Paolo |date=8 April 2013 |access-date=19 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820024914/http://www.mondopallone.it/2013/04/08/piccola-storia-della-tattica-la-nascita-del-catenaccio-il-vianema-e-nereo-rocco-linter-di-foni-e-di-herrera-iv-parte/ |archive-date=20 August 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In Italy, the ''libero'' is also  thought to have evolved from the [[Midfielder#Centre-half|centre-half]]-back role in the English WM system, or sistema, which was known as the ''centromediano metodista'' role in Italian football jargon, due to its association with the ''[[metodo]]'' system; in the ''metodo'' system, however, the "metodista" was given both defensive and creative duties, functioning as both a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|ball–winner]] and [[Midfielder#Deep-lying playmaker (Strolling 10)|deep-lying playmaker]]. Juventus manager [[Felice Borel]] used [[Carlo Parola]] in the centre-half role, as a player who would drop back into the defence to mark opposing forwards, but also start attacks after winning back possession, in a similar manner to the sweeper, which led to the development of this specialised position.<ref name="volo">{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/sport/calcio/serie-a/2016-2017/cards/volo-bonucci-classifica-8-migliori-difensori-italiani-sempre/post-scriptum-parola.shtml|title=Il volo di Bonucci e la classifica degli 8 migliori difensori italiani di sempre|publisher={{Lang|it|Il Corriere della Sera}}|language=it|author1=Mario Sconcerti|date=23 November 2016|access-date=27 December 2016|archive-date=7 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307124337/https://www.corriere.it/sport/calcio/serie-a/2016-2017/cards/volo-bonucci-classifica-8-migliori-difensori-italiani-sempre/post-scriptum-parola.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goal.com/it/news/2/serie-a/2010/03/15/1833664/cera-una-volta-il-football-parola-e-quella-rovesciata |title=C'era una volta il Football – Parola e quella rovesciata IMMORTALE |publisher=Goal.com |last1=Giusto |first1=Antonio |language=it |date=15 March 2010 |access-date=17 May 2020 |archive-date=11 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220711064314/https://www.goal.com/it/news/2/serie-a/2010/03/15/1833664/cera-una-volta-il-football-parola-e-quella-rovesciata |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://vivoperlei.calciomercato.com/articolo/la-parola-a-quella-rovesciata |title=Blog: La "Parola" a quella rovesciata: chi era costui? |publisher=calciomercato.com |language=it |date=10 April 2020 |access-date=17 May 2020 |archive-date=15 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415000949/https://vivoperlei.calciomercato.com/articolo/la-parola-a-quella-rovesciata |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="ilpalloneracconta">{{cite web |url=http://ilpalloneracconta.blogspot.com/2007/09/carlo-parola.html |title=Carlo PAROLA |publisher=ilpalloneracconta |language=it |date=20 September 2019 |access-date=17 May 2020 |archive-date=7 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307124335/http://ilpalloneracconta.blogspot.com/2007/09/carlo-parola.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="ritiri e regista">{{cite news |url=https://www.corriere.it/sport/cards/mezzo-secolo-senza-vittorio-pozzo-mitico-discusso-ct-che-cambio-calcio-italiano/ritiri-regista.shtml |title=Mezzo secolo senza Vittorio Pozzo, il mitico (e discusso) c.t. che cambiò il calcio italiano: Ritiri e regista |work={{Lang|it|Il Corriere della Sera}} |language=it |last1=Radogna |first1=Fiorenzo |page=8 |date=20 December 2018 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=26 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210826002709/https://www.corriere.it/sport/cards/mezzo-secolo-senza-vittorio-pozzo-mitico-discusso-ct-che-cambio-calcio-italiano/ritiri-regista.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> Indeed, Herrera's ''catenaccio'' strategy with his ''Grande Inter'' side saw him withdraw a player from his team's midfield and instead deploy them further-back in defence as a sweeper.<ref name="Profilo: Helenio Herrera">{{cite web |url=https://it.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0231-0e94dc2f87d8-92b9107d1dd6-1000--profilo-helenio-herrera/ |title=Profilo: Helenio Herrera |publisher=[[UEFA]] |language=it |date=4 September 2016 |access-date=22 May 2020 |archive-date=31 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211031091355/https://it.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0231-0e94dc2f87d8-92b9107d1dd6-1000--profilo-helenio-herrera/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Prior to Viani, [[Ottavio Barbieri]] is also thought by some pundits to have introduced the sweeper role to Italian football during his time as [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]]'s manager. Like Viani, he was influenced by Rappan's ''verrou'', and made several alterations to the English WM system or "sistema", which led to his system being described as ''mezzosistema''. His system used a man-marking back-line, with three man-marking defenders and a full-back who was described as a ''terzino volante'' (or ''vagante'', as noted at the time by former footballer and ''[[Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' journalist [[Renzo De Vecchi]]); the latter position was essentially a ''libero'', which was later also used by Viani in his ''vianema'' system, and Rocco in his ''catenaccio'' system.<ref name="Storie di schemi: l’evoluzione della tattica">{{cite web |url=https://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/storie-di-schemi.html |title=Storie di schemi: l'evoluzione della tattica |date=24 December 2015 |publisher=Storie di Calcio |language=it |access-date=19 May 2020 |archive-date=4 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221204094350/https://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/storie-di-schemi.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/genoa-top-11-all-time.html |title=Genoa: Top 11 All Time |date=9 August 2017 |publisher=Storie di Calcio |language=it |access-date=21 May 2020 |archive-date=25 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210625220526/https://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/genoa-top-11-all-time.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>cbcsports.com [http://www.cbc.ca/sports/worldcup2006/history/events/1962.html 1962 Chile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618100013/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/worldcup2006/history/events/1962.html |date=18 June 2006 }}</ref><ref>fifa.com [https://web.archive.org/web/20070701212342/http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/matchreport/newsid=512172.html Intercontinental Cup 1969]</ref>

Though sweepers may be expected to build counter-attacking moves, and as such require better ball control and passing ability than typical centre-backs, their talents are often confined to the defensive realm. For example, the ''catenaccio'' system of play, used in Italian football in the 1960s, often employed a predominantly defensive sweeper who mainly "roamed" around the back line; according to Schianchi, [[Ivano Blason]] is considered to be the first true ''libero'' in Italy, who – under manager [[Alfredo Foni]] with [[Inter Milan|Inter]] and subsequently Nereo Rocco with [[Calcio Padova|Padova]] – would serve as the last man in his team, positioned deep behind the defensive line, and clearing balls away from the penalty area. [[Armando Picchi]] was subsequently also a leading exponent of the more traditional variant of this role in Helenio Herrera's ''[[Grande Inter]]'' side of the 1960s.<ref name="pyramid"/><ref name="Nereo Rocco, l'inventore del catenaccio che diventò Paròn d'Europa"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inter.it/it/societa/storia2005-2.html |title=La leggenda della Grande Inter |trans-title=The legend of the Grande Inter |publisher=Inter.it|language=it|access-date=10 September 2014 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019213304/http://www.inter.it/it/societa/storia2005-2.html|archive-date=19 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/sport/calcio/serie-a/2016-2017/cards/volo-bonucci-classifica-8-migliori-difensori-italiani-sempre/terzo-picchi.shtml|title=Il volo di Bonucci e la classifica degli 8 migliori difensori italiani di sempre|publisher={{Lang|it|Il Corriere della Sera}}|language=it|author1=Mario Sconcerti|date=23 November 2016|access-date=27 December 2016|archive-date=15 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191015121408/https://www.corriere.it/sport/calcio/serie-a/2016-2017/cards/volo-bonucci-classifica-8-migliori-difensori-italiani-sempre/terzo-picchi.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimouomo.com/catenaccio-storia-origini/ |title=Breve storia del catenaccio |publisher=Ultimo Uomo |language=it |last1=Aquè |first1=Federico |date=25 March 2020 |access-date=19 May 2020 |archive-date=31 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230131112745/https://www.ultimouomo.com/catenaccio-storia-origini/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The more modern ''libero'' possesses the defensive qualities of the typical ''libero'' while being able to expose the opposition during counterattacks by carrying or playing the ball out from the back.<ref name="Positions guide: Sweeper"/> Some sweepers move forward into midfield, and distribute the ball up-field, while others intercept passes and get the ball off the opposition without needing to hurl themselves into tackles. If the sweeper does move up the field to distribute the ball, they will need to make a speedy recovery and run back into their position. In modern football, its usage has been fairly restricted, with few clubs in the biggest leagues using the position.

The full-backs (the left-back and the right-back) locate the holding wide positions and up until the 1950s, the full-backs would traditionally stay in defence at all times, except on set-pieces. There is one full-back on each side of the field except in defences with fewer than four players, where there may be no full-backs and instead only centre-backs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://accurapid.com/journal/44soccer.htm |title=Football is Coming Home to Die-Hard Translators |work=Article on the Translation Journal |date=1 April 2008 |access-date=14 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327175724/http://accurapid.com/journal/44soccer.htm |archive-date=27 March 2008}}</ref>

The later 3–2–5 style (also known as the WM formation) involved a third dedicated defender, causing the left and right full-backs to occupy wider positions.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/nov/15/newsstory.sport8 |title=Knowledge Unlimited: What a refreshing tactic |date=15 November 2000 |access-date=22 November 2018 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Sean |last=Ingle |archive-date=18 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018010500/http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,398055,00.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Later, the adoption of 4–2–4 with another central defender<ref name="fifa424">{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/en/development/index/0,1219,16310,00.html?articleid=16310# |title=The 4–2–4 system takes Brazil to two World Cup victories |date=11 September 2000 |access-date=22 November 2018|publisher=FIFA |first=Walter |last=Lutz |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109164350/http://www.fifa.com/en/development/index/0%2C1219%2C16310%2C00.html%3Farticleid%3D16310 |archive-date=9 January 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> led the wide defenders to play even further over to counteract the opposing wingers, and also provide support offensively to complement their own wingers on the flanks. [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] of the 1950s is often regarded as pioneering this style of play, with [[Djalma Santos]] and [[Nílton Santos]] viewed by many as the first modern wing-backs. Over time, the full-back position became increasingly specialised for dynamic players who could not only defend, but also had pace and crossing ability to fulfil this role, as opposed to the central defenders who remained fairly static and commonly relied on strength, height and positioning.

In the modern game, full-backs have taken on a more attacking role than was the case traditionally, often overlapping with wingers down the flank, or more recently, playing "inverted", cutting into the middle of the pitch with the ball and shooting or passing to the strikers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fleet-of-foot full-backs carry key to effective attacking |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/06/sport.comment1 |access-date=11 December 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=David |last=Pleat |date=6 June 2007 |archive-date=4 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104120020/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/06/sport.comment1 |url-status=live }} [[David Pleat]] explains in a ''Guardian'' article how full-backs aid football teams when attacking.</ref> Wingerless formations, such as the diamond [[Formation (association football)#4–4–2|4–4–2]] formation, demand the full-back to cover considerable ground up and down the flank. Some of the responsibilities of modern full-backs include:

* Provide a physical obstruction to opposition attacking players by shepherding them towards an area where they exert less influence. They may manoeuvre in a fashion that causes the opponent to cut in towards the centre-back or defensive midfielder with their weaker foot, where they are likely to be dispossessed. Otherwise, [[Jockeying (association football)|jockeying]] and smart positioning may simply pin back a winger in an area where they are less likely to exert influence.
* Making off-the-ball runs into spaces down the channels and supplying crosses into the opposing penalty box.
* Throw-ins are often assigned to full-backs.
* Marking wingers and other attacking players. Full-backs generally do not commit to challenges in their opponents' half. However, they aim to quickly dispossess attacking players who have already breached the defensive line with a sliding tackle from the side. Markers must, however, avoid keeping too tight on opponents or risk disrupting the defensive organisation.<ref>{{cite news |title=How Gunners can avoid being pulled apart by Brazilian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/18/arsenal |access-date=11 December 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=David |last=Pleat |date=18 February 2008 |archive-date=4 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104120439/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/18/arsenal |url-status=live }} David Pleat explains the team effort in marking an attacking player stationed in the outside-wing position.</ref>
* Maintaining tactical discipline by ensuring other teammates do not overrun the defensive line and inadvertently play an opponent onside.
* Providing a passing option down the flank; for instance, by creating opportunities for sequences like one-two passing moves.
* In wingerless formations, full-backs need to cover the roles of both wingers and full-backs, although defensive work may be shared with one of the central midfielders.
* Additionally, attacking full-backs help to pin both opposition full-backs and wingers deeper in their own half with aggressive attacking intent. Their presence in attack also forces the opposition to withdraw players from central midfield, which the team can seize to its advantage.<ref>{{cite news |title=How Larsson swung the tie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/may/18/championsleague200506.championsleague |access-date=11 December 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=David |last=Pleat |date=18 May 2006 |archive-date=4 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104120830/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/may/18/championsleague200506.championsleague |url-status=live }} David Pleat explains how the introductions of Barcelona full-back [[Juliano Belletti]] and striker [[Henrik Larsson]] in the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]] improved Barcelona's presence in wide areas. Belletti eventually scored the winning goal for the final.</ref>

Due to the physical and technical demands of their playing position, successful full-backs need a wide range of attributes, which make them suited for adaptation to other roles on the pitch. Many of the game's utility players, who can play in multiple positions on the pitch, are natural full-backs. Two rather prominent examples are former [[Associazione Calcio Milan|A.C. Milan]] left-back [[Paolo Maldini]] and the former [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|PSG]] full-back [[Sergio Ramos]], who have played on the flanks as full-backs and in central defence throughout their career. In the modern game, full-backs often chip in a fair share of assists with their runs down the flank when the team is on a counter-attack like [[Leighton Baines]] and [[Trent Alexander-Arnold]]. The more common attributes of full-backs, however, include:

* Pace and stamina to handle the demands of covering large distances up and down the flank and outrunning opponents.
* A healthy work rate and team responsibility.
* Marking and tackling abilities and a sense of anticipation.
* Good off-the-ball ability to create attacking opportunities for their team by running into empty channels.
* Dribbling ability. Many of the game's eminent attacking full-backs are excellent dribblers in their own right and occasionally deputise as attacking wingers.
* Player intelligence. As is common for defenders, full-backs need to decide during the flow of play whether to stick close to a winger or maintain a suitable distance. Full-backs that stay too close to attacking players are vulnerable to being pulled out of position and leaving a gap in the defence. A quick passing movement like a pair of one-two passes will leave the channel behind the defending full-back open. This vulnerability is a reason why wingers considered to be dangerous are double-marked by both the full-back and the winger. This allows the full-back to focus on holding their defensive line.<ref>{{cite news |title=City countered by visitors' Petrov defence |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/dec/31/newsstory.liverpool |access-date=11 December 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=David |last=Pleat |date=31 December 2007 |archive-date=4 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104120927/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/dec/31/newsstory.liverpool |url-status=live }} David Pleat discusses the tactical implications of full-backs and other defenders marking wingers in a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' match analysis.</ref>

Full-backs rarely score goals, as they often have to stay back to cover for the centre-backs during corner kicks and free kicks, when the centre backs usually go forward to attempt to score from headers. That said, full-backs can sometimes score during counterattacks by running in from the wings, often involving one-two passing moves with midfield players.

=== Inverted full-backs ===  
An '''inverted full-back''' is a defender who, instead of remaining in a wide position, moves into central midfield areas when their team has possession.<ref name="CoachesVoice">{{cite web |title=Inverted full-backs: football tactics explained |url=https://learning.coachesvoice.com/cv/inverted-full-backs-guardiola-cancelo-trent-alexander-arnold-lahm-football-tactics/ |website=Coaches' Voice |date=19 October 2022 |access-date=20 July 2025}}</ref><ref name="Wilson2018">{{Cite book

In possession, an inverted full-back functions almost like an additional midfielder. They often form passing triangles with the centre-backs and midfielders, providing forward passing angles and helping the team progress the ball through the middle.<ref name="CoachesVoice" /><ref name="FourFourTwo" /><ref name="TFAcontrolcentre">{{cite web |title=Using inverted fullbacks to control the centre |url=https://totalfootballanalysis.com/article/theory-using-inverted-fullbacks-to-control-the-centre-2 |publisher=Total Football Analysis |date=15 December 2023 |access-date=20 July 2025}}</ref> This requires excellent technical ability and vision to operate in congested central areas.<ref name="CoachesVoice" /><ref name="FourFourTwo" /> By tucking inside, an inverted full-back allows midfielders (such as number eights) to push higher, effectively turning a 4–3–3 into a 3–2–2–3 shape in possession.<ref name="FourFourTwo" /><ref name="CoachesVoice" /> Teams that dominate possession use this movement to create a numerical advantage in midfield, which can pull the opposition’s wide defenders out of position and open space elsewhere on the flank.<ref name="CoachesVoice" /><ref name="FourFourTwo" />

When the ball is lost, the inverted full-back typically drops back to a wider defensive position. In the immediate moments after a turnover, however, they help disrupt the opposition’s attack from the centre. Coaches note that they will “briefly remain in the centre of the pitch,” breaking up or slowing counterattacks through interceptions or tackles.<ref name="CoachesVoice" /><ref name="JobsInFootball" /> This central presence also aids the team’s counter-pressing, as the inverted full-back can screen passes toward the strikers and help limit space in the midfield.<ref name="CoachesVoice" /><ref name="FourFourTwo" /> Eventually, though, they recover to cover the flank, ensuring the team is not exposed on that side.<ref name="CoachesVoice" /><ref name="FourFourTwo" />

Many modern coaches have used inverted full-backs. Guardiola’s Bayern and City sides are the most famous examples,<ref name="FourFourTwo" /><ref name="CoachesVoice" /> but managers like [[Marcelo Bielsa]] (Chile), [[Roberto De Zerbi]], and [[Ange Postecoglou]] have also employed versions of this tactic.<ref name="FourFourTwo" /> [[Mikel Arteta]]’s [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] have regularly seen [[Ben White (footballer)|Ben White]] or [[Oleksandr Zinchenko (footballer)|Oleksandr Zinchenko]] sit narrowly inside during possession.<ref name="FourFourTwo" />

This role carries certain risks: without a traditional overlapping full-back, teams may lack width in attack and risk isolating their wingers.<ref name="FourFourTwo" /> It also requires extremely versatile players – as noted, teams “need to be top-class to do it”, since few defenders are both technical playmakers and quick recoverers.<ref name="CoachesVoice" /><ref name="FourFourTwo" /> When executed well, however, inverted full-backs can help a team dominate possession, create overloads in midfield, and draw opponents out of position, adding a tactical edge to the side’s build-up play.<ref name="CoachesVoice" /><ref name="FourFourTwo" />

==Wing-back==
[[File:Caitlin Foord in action at 2017 Algarve Cup.jpeg|thumb|upright|Wing-back [[Caitlin Foord]] (right, wearing no. 9) in action with [[Australia women's national soccer team|Australia]] against [[China women's national football team|China]] at the [[2017 Algarve Cup]].]]

The wing-back is a variation on the full-back, but with a heavier emphasis on attack. Wing-backs are typically some of the fastest players on a team, when employed. Wing-backs are typically used in a formation with three centre-backs and are sometimes classified as midfielders instead of defenders. They can, however, be used in formations with only two centre-backs, such as in [[Jürgen Klopp]]'s 4–3–3 system that he used at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], in which the wing-backs play high up the field to compensate for a lack of width in attack. In the evolution of the modern game, wing-backs are the combination of [[Midfielder#Winger|wingers]] and full-backs. As such, this position is one of the most physically demanding in modern football. Successful use of wing-backs is one of the main prerequisites for the 3–5–2 and 5–3–2 formations to function effectively.

Wing-backs are often more adventurous than full-backs and are expected to provide width, especially in teams without wingers. A wing-back needs to be of exceptional stamina, be able to provide crosses upfield and defend effectively against opponents' attacks down the flanks. A defensive midfielder may be fielded to cover the advances of wing-backs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197076.stm |title=Positions guide: Wingback |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=21 June 2008 |date=1 September 2005 |location=London |archive-date=4 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230404051419/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197076.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> It can also be occupied by wingers and side midfielders in a three centre-back formation, as seen by Italian manager [[Antonio Conte]].

Examples of players who could and did play as wing-backs were [[AC Milan]] teammates [[Cafu]] and [[Serginho (footballer, born 1971)|Serginho]], Barcelona player [[Dani Alves]], former Arsenal player [[Héctor Bellerín|Hector Bellerin]], [[Roberto Carlos]] of Real Madrid's [[Galácticos]] era, former River Plate's defender [[Juan Pablo Sorín]], World Cup winning German [[Andreas Brehme]], [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]]'s legend [[Antonio Benarrivo]], [[Angelo Di Livio]] of Juventus and Italy and former [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]], Arsenal and Barcelona star [[Sylvinho]].
