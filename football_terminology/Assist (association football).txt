{{Short description|Contribution by a player which helps to score a goal}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2025}}
In [[association football]], an '''assist''' is a contribution leading to the [[Scoring in association football|scoring of a goal]], where the contribution is made by someone on the scoring team other than the scorer. Statistics for assists made by players may be kept officially by the organisers of a competition, or unofficially by, for example, journalists or organisers of [[Fantasy football (Association)|fantasy football]] competitions. Recording assists is not part of the official [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] and the criteria for an assist to be awarded may vary. Record of assists was virtually not kept at all until the end of the 20th century, although reports of matches commonly described a player as having "made" one or more goals. Since the 1990s, some leagues have kept official record of assists and based awards on them.

{{Anchor|Contribution}}<!--[[Goal contribution]] redirects here-->The separate player statistics "[[Scoring in association football#Attribution of goals|goals {{bracket|scored}}]]" and "assists" may be aggregated to a statistic called "[goal] '''contributions'''" or "[goal] '''involvements'''" (analogous to what is called a [[point (ice hockey)|point]] in [[ice hockey]]).

== Criteria ==
Most commonly, an assist is credited to a player for [[passing (association football)|passing]] or [[cross (football)|crossing]] the ball to the scorer.  It may also be awarded to a player whose shot rebounds (off a defender, [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] or goalpost) to a teammate who scores. Some systems may credit an assist to a player who wins a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] or a [[Direct free kick|free kick]] for another player to convert,<ref name="tsg86"/><ref name="tsg90"/> or to an attacking player for contributing to an [[own goal]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.haverford.edu/athletics/soccerm/07Stats/070918hm.htm |title=Haverford College vs Alvernia College |date=18 September 2007 |publisher=[[Haverford College]] |access-date=21 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713150309/http://www.haverford.edu/athletics/soccerm/07Stats/070918hm.htm |archive-date=13 July 2007}}</ref> A goal may be unassisted, or have one assist; some systems allow for two assists.<ref name="tsg86"/><ref name="ncaas5a1p1"/>

=== Opta criteria ===
[[Opta Sports|Opta]], a British [[sports analytics]] company and the official provider of [[Premier League]] statistics,<ref>{{cite web |title=Who are Opta Index? |url=http://www.optasoccer.com/optamizer/ABOUT/index.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001213173200/http://www.optasoccer.com/optamizer/ABOUT/index.asp |archive-date=13 December 2000 |publisher=Opta Index Limited |access-date=8 December 2017 }}</ref><ref name="SIG1999">{{cite web |date=21 December 1999 |title=Sports Internet Group plc Results for the period to 31 August 1999 |url=https://www.investegate.co.uk/ArticlePrint.aspx?id=199912210701338525C |publisher=Sports Internet Group plc |via=Investegate |access-date=8 December 2017 |archive-date=27 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201227172508/https://www.investegate.co.uk/ArticlePrint.aspx?id=199912210701338525C |url-status=dead }}</ref> defines an assist as "The final touch from a teammate, which leads to the recipient of the ball scoring a goal". ''Opta'' requires that if the assist is deflected by an opposition player, it must be deemed as travelling to the goalscorer irrespective of the deflection. Also according to ''Opta'', "in the event of an [[own goal]], [[Free kick (association football)#Direct and indirect free kicks|direct free kick]] goal and direct corner goal, an assist will not be awarded. This same rule applies to penalties unless the penalty taker chooses to pass the ball for another player to score."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.statsperform.com/opta-event-definitions/ |title=Opta event definitions |publisher=Opta |access-date=23 June 2024 |archive-date=13 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240613053131/https://www.statsperform.com/opta-event-definitions/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to Opta, an assist is ''not'' awarded in the following cases:

* Goals scored directly from [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kicks]], [[Free kick (association football)|direct free kicks]], or [[Corner kick|corner-kicks]]
* [[Own goals]]
* Deflected or rebounded balls from opponents that affected the ball's delivery to the goal scorer.
* Balls rebounded off the post.

Opta attest that this strict definition makes assist statistics more accurate and fair in analyzing players' sports performance.

=== FIFA World Cup ===

FIFA's Technical Study Group is responsible for awarding assist points at the [[FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-301_03a_fwc-awards_new_2466.pdf |title=adidas Golden Shoe Award |publisher=FIFA |access-date=29 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626175841/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-301_03a_fwc-awards_new_2466.pdf |archive-date=26 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the Technical Study Group's report on the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]], the authors calculated for the first time unofficial statistics for assists, developing the following criteria:<ref name="tsg86">

</ref>
# An assist was awarded to the player who had given the last pass to the goalscorer.
# In addition, the last but two holder of the ball could get an assist provided that his action had decisive importance for the goal.
# After goals from rebounds those players were awarded an assist who had shot on target.
# After goals scored on penalty or by a [[direct free kick|directly converted free-kick]] the fouled player received a point.
# In case that the goalscorer had laid on the goal for himself ([[dribbling|dribble]], solo run), no assists were awarded.
# No assists were awarded, either, if the goalscorer [[interception|took advantage of a missed pass]] by an opponent.

The [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] technical report adopted similar criteria, but changed the free-kick/penalty criterion:<ref name="tsg90">

*Where goals resulting from penalties are concerned, the player who is fouled in the area receives an assist point (unless, that is, the player who is fouled subsequently executes the penalty himself).{{cn|date=May 2025}}

''Planet World Cup'' has calculated some retrospective data on assists back to the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1966/wc66statistics.html |title=World Cup 1966 statistics |publisher=Planet World Cup |access-date=29 July 2008 |archive-date=23 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023182853/http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1966/wc66statistics.html |url-status=live }}</ref> though the 1986 data differs from that of FIFA.<ref name="tsg86"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1986/wc86statistics.html |title=World Cup 1986 statistics |publisher=Planet World Cup |access-date=29 July 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080720164229/http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1986/wc86statistics.html| archive-date= 20 July 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

==Statistics==
These totals are the official records recognised by the relevant governing body. Independent statistics providers may have different data, either through crediting different players for a given goal, or through having begun recording assists earlier or later than the official statistics provider. Expected assists (xA) is a [[performance metric]] that measures the likelihood that a completed pass becomes an assist, factoring in distance and the type of pass.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Advanced metrics explained |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12829539/expected-goals-expected-assists-pressures-carries-high-turnovers-and-more-advanced-stats-explained |access-date=13 March 2025 |archive-date=11 June 2025 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20250611171910/https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12829539/expected-goals-expected-assists-pressures-carries-high-turnovers-and-more-advanced-stats-explained |url-status=live }}</ref>
