In sports, a '''goal celebration''' (or in slang a 'celly') is the practice of celebrating the scoring of a [[Scoring in association football|goal]]. The celebration is normally performed by the goalscorer, and may involve their teammates, the manager or coaching staff or the supporters of the team. Whilst referring to the celebration of a goal in general, the term can also be applied to specific actions, such as a player removing their shirt or performing a somersault.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lev |first1=Assaf |last2=Galily |first2=Yair |last3=Eldadi |first3=Omer |last4=Tenenbaum |first4=Gershon |title=Deconstructing celebratory acts following goal scoring among elite professional football players |journal=[[PLOS One]] |date=2020 |volume=15 |issue=9 |article-number=e0238702 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0238702 |pmid=32936807 |doi-access=free |pmc=7494092 |bibcode=2020PLoSO..1538702L }}</ref> Celebrations are generally more substantial in lower-scoring sports, such as [[association football]] and [[ice hockey]], where a score has greater significance.

Many goal celebrations have been immortalised, such as in a statue ([[Thierry Henry]] and [[Statue of Bobby Orr|Bobby Orr]]), advertisements ([[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]), postage stamps ([[Pelé]]), magazine covers, or in video games: [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Gareth Bale]], [[Lionel Messi]] among many others are featured in the [[FIFA (video game series)|''FIFA'']] and ''[[EA Sports FC]]'' series.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Beech |first=Richard |date=2013-09-12 |title=Fifa 14 celebrations: How to do Gareth Bale, Ronaldo, and Lionel Messi's signature moves |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/fifa-14-celebrations-how-gareth-2268393 |access-date=2025-05-27 |website=Daily Mirror |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Evolution of EA Sport's FIFA 14 Video Game |url=https://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/ABC_Univision/evolution-ea-sports-fifa-14-video-game/story?id=20028621 |access-date=29 September 2018 |agency=ABC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=8 new celebrations we'd love to see in FIFA 18 |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/8-new-celebrations-wed-love-see-fifa-18 |access-date=5 November 2018 |work=FourFourTwo}}</ref>

==Celebration==

===Goal song===
[[File:ACMilanultras2006curvasud.jpg|thumb|In addition to "[[Jump (Van Halen song)|Jump]]" being played, flares sometimes go off at A.C. Milan's [[San Siro]] when a goal is scored.]]
A ''goal song'' or ''goal celebration music'' is a short piece of music that is played in sports like [[Association football|football]] or [[ice hockey]] after a goal is scored. A goal horn sometimes sounds before the song is played, especially in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).

One such song is [[Bellini (German band)|Bellini]]'s "[[Samba de Janeiro]]", which was used as the goal song in [[UEFA Euro 2008]]. Van Halen's "[[Jump (Van Halen song)|Jump]]" is played every time [[A.C. Milan]] scores a goal at the [[San Siro]].<ref name="Songs">{{cite news |title=The songs of soccer, from stadium anthems to Ronaldo's solo |url=https://www.dw.com/en/the-songs-of-soccer-from-stadium-anthems-to-ronaldos-solo/a-19313958 |access-date=8 October 2018 |agency=DW.com}}</ref> "[[Song 2]]" by Blur is played at some German and Austrian clubs.<ref name="Songs"/> In North America, [[Rock and Roll (Gary Glitter song)|"Rock and Roll (Part Two)"]] by the [[Glitter Band]] is commonly played. [[Donbas Arena]], the home ground of Ukrainian football club [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]], has a tradition of playing music each time home players score goals, with a track corresponding to the nationality of a scorer. For example, "[[Sabre Dance]]" by the Armenian [[Aram Khachaturian]] was played whenever his compatriot [[Henrikh Mkhitaryan]] scored.<ref name="SBHM">{{cite web|title=Sabre Dance by Henrikh Mkhitaryan|url=http://ukrainianfootball1894.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/sabre-dance-by-henrikh-mkhitaryan.html|publisher=Ukrainian Football 1894|access-date=22 August 2012|date=16 August 2012|archive-date=11 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011072244/http://ukrainianfootball1894.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/sabre-dance-by-henrikh-mkhitaryan.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Henrik Mkhitaryan orchestrates Shakhtar Donetsk's great leap forward|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/oct/22/henrik-mkhitaryan-shakhtar-donetsk|access-date=9 June 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 October 2012 | first = Jonathan | last = Wilson}}</ref> When [[FC Bayern Munich]] score a goal in the [[Allianz Arena]], the [[Can-can]] plays.

In ice hockey, the use of goal songs is very common. Prior to 2012, a goal by the NHL's [[Montreal Canadiens]], on [[Bell Centre|home ice]], was followed by [[U2]]'s "[[Vertigo (U2 song)|Vertigo]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fans.canadiens.nhl.com/community/topic/21263-habs-goal-song/|title=Habs Goal Song|publisher=[[Montreal Canadiens]]|access-date=26 February 2011|archive-date=14 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714180430/http://fans.canadiens.nhl.com/community/topic/21263-habs-goal-song/}}</ref> The [[New York Rangers]] play the song "[[Slapshot (Ray Castoldi song)|Slapshot]]", which was written by [[Ray Castoldi]], the music director at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The [[Chicago Blackhawks]] and [[Nottingham Panthers]] play "[[Chelsea Dagger]]" by [[The Fratellis]] after every home goal.

* A group hug of the players on the pitch with the scorer underneath, or the players jumping on each other's shoulders.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mario Balotelli Goal: Brazil, Italy Draw 2-2 (VIDEO) |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/22/mario-balotelli-goal-brazil-italy_n_2933450.html?guccounter=1 |access-date=9 October 2018 |work=Huffington Post}}</ref>
* The scorer running to corner flag, standing with one of his hands holding the flagpole while screaming – [[Gabriel Batistuta]]'s similar celebration when he played for [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] inspired the design of his life-size bronze statue.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ghosh |first1=Bobby |title=Splitting a Pair |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,257149-2,00.html |access-date=8 September 2018 |work=Time magazine |archive-date=22 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322104426/http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,257149-2,00.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>
* The scorer putting an index finger to his lips, as if telling the (opposition) crowd and/or critics to be quiet – Real Madrid forward [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl]] memorably celebrated in this manner when scoring against [[El Clásico|fierce rivals]] Barcelona at the [[Nou Camp]] in 1999.<ref name="Marca">{{cite news |title=Real Madrid-Barcelona: Celebrations in enemy territory |url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2017/04/24/58fe5ed8ca47413f548b461c.html |access-date=9 October 2018 |work=Marca}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=When Raul ended Madrid's humiliation, silenced Nou Camp |url=http://www.egypttoday.com/Article/8/39224/When-Raul-ended-Madrid's-humiliation-silenced-Nou-Camp |access-date=9 October 2018 |work=Egypt Today}}</ref> Starting with the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] adopted a variation in which he would wag his index finger at the crowd, as if telling his critics off.
* The scorer pretending to fire a machine gun, as done by [[Gabriel Batistuta]] and [[Edinson Cavani]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Golden Goal: Gabriel Batistuta for Fiorentina v Arsenal (1999) |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/dec/04/golden-goal-gabriel-batistuta-for-fiorentina-v-arsenal-1999 |access-date=9 October 2018|work=The Guardian}}</ref>
* The scorer turning his wrist near his ear, this is usually done while running. It was used many times, if not all, by [[Luca Toni]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://it.uefa.com/news/newsid=337266.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610053753/http://it.uefa.com/news/newsid=337266.html|archive-date=10 June 2016|title=La mano di Toni sul Mondiale|trans-title=Toni's hand on the World Cup|publisher=[[UEFA]]|language=it|author1=Paolo Menicucci|date=9 September 2005|access-date=9 May 2016}}</ref>
* The scorer diving onto the grass with arms and legs outstretched. This was supposedly first done by [[Jürgen Klinsmann]], shortly after he joined [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. Klinsmann was actually performing this goal celebration to satirise his own (in his belief unjustified) reputation for diving to win free-kicks and penalties. It became known as "a Klinsmann".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hunt|first1=Chris|title=Jürgen Klinsmann: One-on-One|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/j%C3%BCrgen-klinsmann-one-one|access-date=22 November 2014|work=[[FourFourTwo]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group]]|date=1 August 2004|archive-date=29 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129040300/http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/j%C3%BCrgen-klinsmann-one-one}}</ref>
* The scorer walking or running away in a nonchalant style with a "cocky" smirk as if to say, "I'm the best, that was easy, etc." An adaptation of this involves the scorer standing still and turning or looking around with said look. This was done by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] striker [[Eric Cantona]], and later by [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]].<ref name=joy>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/dec/14/newsstory|title=The Joy of Six: goal celebrations|author=Scott Murray|journal=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 December 2007}}</ref>
*Ibrahimović also popularised shaping the fingers on both hands in the shape of a heart for his goal celebrations. This has since been used by Gareth Bale,<ref>{{cite news |last=Trotman |first=Andrew |title=Gareth Bale plans to put 'heart' goal celebration on clothing after filing trademark |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10042652/Gareth-Bale-plans-to-put-heart-goal-celebration-on-clothing-after-filing-trademark.html |access-date=9 May 2013 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=7 May 2013}}</ref> Angel Di María & [[Lorenzo Insigne]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/napoli-insigne-i-dedicate-this-goal-to-my-wife-manchester-city-53825 |title=Napoli, Insigne: "I dedicate this goal to my wife.

* The scorer outstretching both arms and running around changing the angle of arms mimicking an aeroplane. This was made famous by former Brazilian striker [[Careca]] and later earned Italian forward [[Vincenzo Montella]] his nickname of "little aeroplane" (''l'aeroplanino'' in Italian).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=2045764.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129140314/http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=2045764.html|archive-date=29 January 2014|title=European football's best nicknames|publisher=UEFA|date=27 January 2014|access-date=18 June 2017}}</ref>
* The scorer outstretching both arms and running straight. Brazilian striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] often celebrated in this manner in his early career – his goal celebration was the basis for [[Pirelli]]'s 1998 commercial where he replaced the figure of Christ from the [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|''Christ the Redeemer'']] statue while in an Inter Milan strip.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pirelli e le metamorfosi della pubblicità |url=https://www.corriere.it/cultura/17_giugno_21/pubblicita-con-la-maiuscola-fondazione-pirelli-corraini-5efebe1c-569c-11e7-a35b-7a875278503a.shtml |access-date=19 September 2018 |work=Corriere Della Sera}}</ref> Zlatan Ibrahimović, whose idol was Ronaldo, often celebrates with both arms outstretched.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ibrahimovic scores two headers and celebrates in customary fashion |url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/international-football/2018/06/10/5b1d531e22601d2f1d8b45ba.html |access-date=8 October 2018 |work=Marca}}</ref>

* The scorer putting the ball underneath their shirt to indicate the pregnancy of a loved one.
* The scorer sucking his thumb as a tribute to his child(ren) or to signify that scoring a goal is like child's play; over the years this has become a trademark celebration of [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] legend [[Francesco Totti]], which gained him the nickname, ''er Pupone'' (Roman dialect for "the big baby").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballitaliano.org/2626/tottis-goal-celebration-is-for-wife-blasi.html|title=Totti's Goal Celebration Is For Wife Blasi|date=5 January 2009|access-date=31 May 2011|publisher=Football Italiano|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113115443/http://www.footballitaliano.org/2626/tottis-goal-celebration-is-for-wife-blasi.html|archive-date=13 January 2010 }}</ref> [[Bruno Fernandes]] often places his hands over his ears after sucking his thumb.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-03-07|title=Bruno Fernandes explains goal celebration after scoring in Manchester derby|url=https://metro.co.uk/2021/03/07/bruno-fernandes-explains-goal-celebration-after-scoring-in-manchester-derby-14203915/|access-date=2021-03-29|website=Metro|language=en}}</ref>

* The scorer exhibiting some kind of dancing after the goal, usually joined in by teammates.

* The scorer removing his shirt. [[Rivaldo]] would most often do this in Brazil matches, holding his shirt in his right hand and spinning it over his head.

* A common alternative, although more common in the late 1990s and early 2000s, was for the scoring player to lift up his shirt and show the crowd a T-shirt with a message underneath. [[Romário]] was a frequent adopter of this kind of celebration, showing up with a different message every match. [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] striker [[Francesco Totti]] often celebrated goals against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] in the [[Rome derby]] in this way, once memorably revealing a t-shirt which sported the Italian equivalent of the phrase "I have done you again!".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asroma.com/en/news/2016/5/the-a-to-z-of-francesco-totti-|title=The A-to-Z of Francesco Totti|website=www.asroma.com|access-date=8 February 2019|archive-date=20 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191220211348/https://www.asroma.com/en/news/2016/5/the-a-to-z-of-francesco-totti-|url-status=dead}}</ref>

* The scorer jumping into the crowd. This is commonly done whenever a very significant goal, such as an injury-time winner, is scored, an example being [[Troy Deeney]]'s [[last-minute goal]] for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 2013, sending Watford to a Wembley Play-Off Final.<ref>{{cite web |title="Here's Hogg...

*"The Thierry Henry" or "Henrying" was made famous by striker [[Thierry Henry]], who would celebrate by simply propping himself up against the goal post while another hand was on the hip, hinting that he's tired and/or tired of scoring goals, and has a "been there, done that"-type of reaction. This went viral in social networks, using the pose to photoshop Henry into appropriate settings, from propping up the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]], to helping [[Muhammad Ali]] with his punching bag.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/thierry-henry-goal-celebration-for-new-york-red-bulls-sparks-henrying-trend-on-twitter-8836545.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Paul | last=Gallagher | title=Thierry Henry goal celebration for New York Red Bulls sparks #henrying trend on Twitter | date=24 September 2013}}</ref>

*The scorer blowing a kiss to the crowd (this can be done in a mocking gesture); alternatively, the scorer provoking the crowd by kissing his team badge, or in the case of Barcelona captain [[Carles Puyol]] in 2009, kissing his [[Senyera|Catalan]] [[armband]] in front of Real Madrid fans.<ref name="Marca"/>
*The scorer pointing/waving to their own fans – alternatively, wave in a provocative manner to opposition fans; after scoring against Manchester United at [[Old Trafford]] in 2009 Liverpool striker [[Fernando Torres]] held his hand in the air to fans of [[Liverpool F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry|arch rivals United]], with his 'five times' gesture (spread out five fingers) signifying Liverpool's five Champions League titles (to United's three).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://talksport.com/football/426223/harry-wilson-fernando-torres-five-times-manchester-united/|title = Pictured: The moment Wilson copied Torres to mock Man United|date = 26 September 2018}}</ref>

*The scorer kissing the club/national badge on their shirt, to show their love and loyalty for the club/country; some players have even revelled in kissing the badge of their new team when scoring against their former club, a notable example being [[Wayne Rooney]] kissing the Manchester United badge when scoring against his boyhood team Everton.<ref>{{cite news |title=Celebrating in style: We look at players who have revelled in goals against their former clubs |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11662/9684619/celebrating-in-style-we-look-at-players-who-have-revelled-in-goals-against-their-former-clubs |access-date=10 October 2018 |agency=Sky Sports}}</ref>
* The scorer jumping and spinning simultaneously with both arms pointing upwards and landing with a firm stance with both arms pointing down.

* The scorer puts on a mask after scoring. Many different masks were used in the past, some of the most notable ones are [[Quincy Promes]], who wore a red mask, [[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]] who used a Black Panther mask and [[Dominic Solanke]] who used Obito's mask.

==Punishment==

According to the rules of the games (Law 12):
:''While it is permissible for a player to demonstrate his joy when a goal has been scored, the celebration must not be excessive.''<ref name=LawsOfTheGame>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100704211500/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf ''Laws of the Game''], 2010/2011, [[FIFA]]</ref>

In recent seasons, [[FIFA]] have attempted to crack down on some of the more enthusiastic celebrations. If a player incites the crowd, jumping into the stands, and/or takes their shirt off or puts the ball under their shirt to indicate a pregnancy after scoring a goal, they are likely to get [[Penalty card#Yellow card|booked]] by the referee. This can cause huge controversy if the player has already been booked, since they would then be sent off. However, some players get around this rule by pulling the hem of their shirts over the head, without taking the shirt off entirely, but this is not always overturned by the referees. Some players have received fines for dropping their shorts after scoring.

Jumping into the crowd is also a bookable offence on the category of ("Deliberately leaving the field of play without the referee's permission", as identified in Law 12).<ref name=LawsOfTheGame/>

Players might be also fined for revealing T-shirts which contain some kind of message directed to the spectators. Notable examples include [[Robbie Fowler]] being fined for showing a T-shirt that was designed to show support for the [[Liverpool dockers' strike (1995–98)|Liverpool dockers' strike]], incorporating the [[Calvin Klein]] "CK" into the word doCKer;<ref>{{cite news |title=Football: Fowler fined for show of support |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-fowler-fined-for-show-of-support-1275535.html |access-date=10 October 2018 |work=The Independent}}</ref> and [[Thierry Henry]], who was fined by [[UEFA]] after he removed his Arsenal shirt to reveal a T-shirt reading "For the new-born Kyd", which was directed to his friend, [[Texas (band)|Texas]] lead singer [[Sharleen Spiteri]], who had just given birth. In 1999, [[Robbie Fowler]] was also fined £60,000 by his club and the [[Premier League]] for having celebrated his penalty goal against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] by getting down on all fours and miming the snorting of [[cocaine]] off of the white touchline. Although it was seen as Fowler's response to being accused of drug abuse in the tabloid press, then-manager [[Gérard Houllier]] famously claimed that he was merely imitating "a cow eating grass".<ref name="Daily Telegraph">{{cite news |title=Football's best and worst goal celebrations |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/6250946/Football-goal-celebrations-best-and-worst.html |access-date=10 October 2018 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref>

==Not celebrating a goal==
Refusing to celebrate a goal or undertaking muted goal celebrations is not unknown and not uncommon in football. In the case of the former, it is often seen when a player scores against a former club, especially one where the player began his career and/or had his greatest period of success, or where he first made his name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/muted-celebrations-why-van-persies-code-conduct-sets-standard|title=Muted celebrations: Why Van Persie's code of conduct sets the standard|work=FourFourTwo|date=2 October 2014}}</ref> Non-celebration against former clubs does seem to be a fairly recent trend, however. There are several recorded examples of players celebrating against their old club prior to the 2000s, when this practice started to become regarded as disrespectful. Conversely, not celebrating a goal for your current side could be considered somewhat strange. Goalkeepers who score goals via a long kick that is perhaps taken by the wind or evades the opposition goalkeeper upon bouncing on the pitch may not celebrate, as a mark of respect to the opposition goalkeeper.

Muted celebration usually occurs when scoring a consolation goal in a match that is otherwise already lost; celebration may be omitted entirely if there is not enough time left on the clock and the losing team wants the match to continue as soon as possible. It also occurs when a large number of goals have been scored by one team in a match, and the result has been put beyond doubt; for later goals, celebrations might be reduced or non-existent.

In ice hockey, it is seen as good etiquette not to celebrate a goal made on an empty net where the goaltender has been pulled, due to the vulnerability of the opposing team and the lack of challenge.

==Injuries==
While unusual, a number of football players have injured themselves during celebration: examples include [[Paulo Diogo]] (who severed a finger after it got caught in a fence), [[Thierry Henry]], [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]], [[Fabián Espíndola]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccer.fanhouse.com/2008/09/09/fabian-espindolas-mls-goal-celebration-gone-wrong/|title=Sports News & latest headlines from AOL|work=AOL.com|access-date=27 December 2009|archive-date=10 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710194633/http://soccer.fanhouse.com/2008/09/09/fabian-espindolas-mls-goal-celebration-gone-wrong/}}</ref> (who celebrated a goal that was later disallowed due to offside) and [[Michy Batshuayi]].<ref>{{cite news|title=World Cup: Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi's celebration kick blows up in his face|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-29/world-cup-celebration-kick-hits-belgium-batshuayi-in-the-face/9923324|date=29 June 2018|access-date=10 July 2018|website=ABC News}}</ref> An Indian footballer, Peter Biaksangzuala, died from a spine injury in 2014 following a failed somersault celebration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/indian-footballer-dies-after-somersault-celebration-goes-terribly-wrong-9805612.html|title=Indian footballer Peter Biaksangzuala dies from spine injury after doing somersault celebration|author=Tom Sheen|date=20 October 2014|work=The Independent}}</ref>

[[Nicolai Muller]] once injured himself while celebrating scoring a goal against [[FC Augsburg]] when he spun around repeatedly in a "helicopter" style which had until that point been his trademark celebration. Medical examination confirmed that the striker had ruptured the [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] in his right knee. He was out of action for 10 months, and after his team was relegated, he left the club.<ref name="hessenschau">{{cite news |title=Rückkehr perfekt!

==Managers and coaches celebrations==

Managers (and coaching staff) have been known for their exuberant goal celebrations. Some notable celebrations include:

* On 10 April 1993, [[Alex Ferguson]]'s Manchester United were losing to Sheffield Wednesday in the Premier League with four minutes of the 90 to go before [[Steve Bruce]] equalised. After 7 minutes of injury time – dubbed [[Alex Ferguson#"Fergie Time"|'Fergie Time']], alluding to extra minutes allegedly being granted to Ferguson's teams to get a goal – Bruce scored the 97th-minute winner, with Ferguson running from his [[Technical area|dugout]] on to the touch line, while assistant Brian Kidd ran and leapt on to the field.<ref>{{cite news |title=From the Vault: Manchester United, 'Fergie Time' and Steve Bruce's headers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/10/vault-steve-bruce-headers-manchester-united |access-date=15 October 2018 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> 
* In the 2004 Champions League last 16 game between Manchester United and Porto, [[José Mourinho]]'s Porto were on the verge of a defeat when Costinha scored a goal with 30 seconds left of the official 90 minutes to win the tie. Mourinho jumped up from his dugout, fists punching the air as he sprinted down the sideline near to his celebrating players – this dramatic celebration is regarded as the moment when Mourinho announced himself to the game.<ref>{{cite news |title=José Mourinho on his Porto touchline run at Old Trafford |url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gOBLwejwPZ8  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302221525/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOBLwejwPZ8 |archive-date=2017-03-02 |access-date=15 October 2018 |agency=UEFA.com}}</ref> 
* In the 2009 Champions League semi-final, [[Pep Guardiola]]'s Barcelona were losing to Chelsea with minutes remaining before [[Andrés Iniesta]] fired in from 20 yards to win the tie on [[away goal rule|away goals]]. An ecstatic Guardiola uncharacteristically sprinted down the touch line near to where his players were celebrating.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/drogba-rages-as-chelsea-crash-out-in-blaze-of-fury-1680489.html|title=Drogba rages as Chelsea crash out in blaze of fury|last=Fleming|first=Mark|date=7 May 2009|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=18 October 2018 | location=London}}</ref>
*At the closing stages of a 2018 Premier League game between Chelsea and Manchester United, United and former Chelsea manager José Mourinho was involved in a tunnel incident. With Chelsea's [[Ross Barkley]] scoring a 96th-minute equaliser, Chelsea's coach, Marco Ianni, celebrated by running in front of the Manchester United bench and clenching his fists close to Mourinho's face.<ref name="Scuffle">{{cite news |title=Jose Mourinho: Manchester United manager says he is not to blame for Chelsea scuffle |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45928442 |access-date=21 October 2018 |agency=BBC}}</ref> An incensed Mourinho leapt up and attempted to chase Ianni down the tunnel, with security intervening. As he sat back down Chelsea fans repeatedly (and loudly) chanted "fuck off Mourinho".<ref name="Chant"/> At full-time, Mourinho walked over to United fans and applauded, and on his way back to the tunnel he held up three fingers towards Chelsea fans, reminding them he won three Premier League titles with the club.<ref name="Scuffle"/><ref name="Chant">{{cite news |title=Jose Mourinho Reveals Aftermath of Astonishing Touchline Fracas |url=https://www.balls.ie/football/jose-mourinho-touchline-fracas-399205 |access-date=21 October 2018 |agency=Balls.ie.}}</ref>
*During a [[Merseyside derby]] in the [[2018–19 Premier League]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] manager [[Jürgen Klopp]] caused controversy for his celebrations near the end of the match. As [[Divock Origi]] scored a 96-minute winner against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], Klopp ran onto the pitch to hug goalkeeper [[Alisson Becker|Alisson]]. Klopp later apologized for his actions, but was nonetheless fined £8,000 by [[The Football Association]].
