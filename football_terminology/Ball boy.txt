Due to the nature of the sport, quick retrieval of loose [[tennis ball|balls]] and delivery of the game balls to the servers are necessary for quick play in tennis. In professional tournaments, every court will have a trained squad of ball boys/girls with positionings and movements designed for maximum efficiency, while also not interfering with active play. As well as dealing with the game balls, ball boys/girls may also provide the players with other assistance, such as the delivery of towels and drinks.<ref name="Wimbledon Ballboys">[http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/behind_the_scenes/201205091336567795051.html About Wimbledon - Behind the scenes, Ball boys and ball girls]. wimbledon.org.</ref>

===Positions===
* ''Nets'' are located on either side of the net to retrieve balls that are trapped by the net. Their job is to gather ''dead'' balls from the court and feed them to the ''bases'' after a point. This is usually done by rolling them alongside the court.
* ''Bases'' are located just off each corner (at either end of the baseline at either end of the court). Their job is to retrieve balls from the ''nets'' and then feed balls to the server.

===Feeding===
''Feeding'' is how the ball boys and girls give the balls to the players. At different tournaments, they use different techniques for feeding. At some tournaments, bases have both arms in the air, feeding the balls with one arm; at others, they have one arm in the air which they feed the balls and the other arm behind their back. When feeding the ball, they must also be aware of a player's preference. Most players accept the standard, which is for the ball boy or girl to gently toss the ball (from the position with their arms extended upwards) such that it bounces one time then to the proper height for the player to catch the ball easily.

===Hiring===
There are various methods for selecting the ball boys and girls for a tournament.  In many tournaments, such as [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] and the [[Queen's Club Championships]], they are picked from or apply through schools, where they are selected by tournaments, and they have to go through a number of selections and tests.<ref name="Wimbledon Ballboys" />  In some other tournaments, such as the [[Nottingham Open]], [[Australian Open]] and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]],<ref>[http://www.usta.com/Global/Pro_Tennis/Grand_Slams/US_Open/News/2009/2009_US_Open_Ballperson_Tryouts.aspx Official Site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627110419/http://www.usta.com/Global/Pro_Tennis/Grand_Slams/US_Open/News/2009/2009_US_Open_Ballperson_Tryouts.aspx |date=2009-06-27 }} United States Tennis Association - 2009 US Open Ballperson Tryouts.</ref> positions are advertised and there are open try-outs.

Applicants are required to pass a physical ability assessment. In addition to fitness and stamina, the abilities to concentrate and remain alert are essential.

==Association football==
[[File:Ball boy.jpg|thumb|right|A ball boy at a football match in China in 2007]]
In 2006, the IFAB Laws of the Game of [[association football]] were changed to [[Multiball system|allow multiple balls to be used]] under the direction of a referee. Higher level organised matches now commonly use 6+ balls with ball boys scattered around the pitch to quicken the pace of play. Typically positioned behind [[advertising board]]s surrounding the pitch, ball boys will try to be in possession of a spare ball at all times, so that this can be given to the players prior to the loose ball being retrieved.

Methods for selecting ball boys vary between grounds.<ref name=AF_how>{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Louise|title=How football clubs choose their ballboys – and ballgirls|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/24/ballboys-eden-hazard-swansea-city-chelsea|access-date=7 June 2014|work=Guardian|date=24 January 2013}}</ref> On occasion, away teams have complained about perceived favour of ball boys towards home sides.<ref name=AF_how/>

Association football ball boys hit the headlines in England in a 2013 [[EFL Cup]] match when [[Eden Hazard]], a member of the away team, which was trailing at the time, appeared to kick at an apparently time-wasting ball boy Charlie Morgan who was lying on top of the ball.<ref name=Haz1>{{cite news|last1=Hytner|first1=David|title=Chelsea's Eden Hazard may face longer ban for ballboy altercation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/25/chelsea-eden-hazard-ban-ballboy|access-date=7 June 2014|work=Guardian|date=25 January 2013}}</ref> Hazard was subsequently [[red card (association football)|sent off]] for violent conduct and suspended for three games.<ref name=Hazard>{{cite news|title=FA rules out increasing Eden Hazard's three-match ban for ballboy kick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/31/fa-eden-hazard-three-match-ban|access-date=7 June 2014|work=Guardian|date=31 January 2013}}</ref> It was later revealed that the ball boy had [[Twitter|tweeted]] the day before that he had intended to waste time.<ref name=Hazard2>{{cite news|title=Swansea City ballboy Charlie Morgan boasted about time wasting before Capital One semi-final with Chelsea|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/league-cup/9823144/Swansea-City-ballboy-Charlie-Morgan-boasted-about-time-wasting-before-Capital-One-semi-final-with-Chelsea.html|access-date=26 October 2018|work=Telegraph|date=24 January 2013}}</ref>

==Baseball==
[[File:Foul Ball (35819434331).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|A ball girl retrieving a [[foul ball]] at a [[Baltimore Orioles]] game]]
Ball kids are stationed in out-of-play areas near the first and third base [[foul line (baseball)|foul line]]s to retrieve out-of-play [[baseball (ball)|baseball]]s. They should not be confused with [[bat boy]]s and bat girls, who remain in or near a team's [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] and the [[home plate]] area, primarily to tend to a team's [[baseball bat]]s.

As ball kids are stationed on the field, albeit in foul territory, they can occasionally interfere with play; such events are governed by Rule 6.01(d), the main point of which is that if the interference is unintentional, any live ball remains alive and in play.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://baseballrulesacademy.com/bat-boy-ball-boy-interference/ |title=Bat Boy or Ball Boy Interference |website=baseballrulesacademy.com |date=15 August 2017 |accessdate=December 16, 2021}}</ref>  For this reason, most teams will use experienced individuals who understand the rules, to minimize mistaken interference.  One of the more infamous examples was the use of a [[Hooters]] girl as a promotion.  The woman unfortunately snagged a ball that was fair and live in a [[Tampa Bay Rays]] game, throwing it to the fans.  The batter was awarded a double on the interference.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://patch.com/florida/clearwater/video-hooters-girl-makes-foul-play-on-fair-ball-at-ph3970ddccec | title=VIDEO: Hooters Girl Makes Foul Play on Fair Ball at Phillies Game | date=12 March 2013 }}</ref>

Since 1992, the [[San Francisco Giants]] have employed older men as "balldudes", instead of the traditional youths. In 1993, Corinne Mullane became the first "balldudette", and she and her daughter Molly, who began working as a balldudette in the 2000s, have since been included in the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] as the first mother-daughter ball-retrieving duo in baseball.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Moffitt |first=Bob |date=March 29, 2019 |title=How An Elk Grove Woman And Her Mother Ended Up Honored In The Baseball Hall Of Fame |url=https://www.capradio.org/132397 |access-date=2023-03-19 |website=capradio.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Bruce |last=Jenkins |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/giants/jenkins/article/Giants-Ball-Dudettes-Bay-Area-mother-daughter-15259401.php |title=How first Ball Dudette landed in Hall of Fame |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=May 10, 2020 |pages=B1, B6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Gates |url=https://baseballhall.org/discover/hall-of-fame-librarian-debuts-as-balldude |title=Hall of Fame 'balldude' |publisher=Baseball Hall of Fame |access-date=June 2, 2020 }}</ref>

==Cricket==
Ball boys are stationed around the field just outside the [[boundary (cricket)|boundary]] to retrieve any balls struck into the spectator stands or to the boundary rope. In India, disabled people are not allowed to be ball-boys anymore after a controversy occurred in 2017, after criticism of the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] surrounding the appearance of a polio-afflicted fan who had been serving as a ball-boy for a few years.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-10-22|title=Polio-afflicted fan Dharamveer Pal 'lives for cricket', BCCI wants him away from boundary|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/polio-afflicted-fan-lives-for-cricket-bcci-wants-him-away-from-boundary-4900688/|access-date=2020-12-14|website=The Indian Express|language=en}}</ref>
