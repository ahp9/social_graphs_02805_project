In [[association football]], the '''United Trinity''' or the '''Holy Trinity''' refers to the [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] trio of [[George Best]], [[Denis Law]] and [[Bobby Charlton|Sir Bobby Charlton]], who helped United become the first ever English club team to win the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in [[1968 European Cup Final|1968]].

Charlton was a member of the [[Busby Babes]], a group of talented young players brought through the [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|club's academy]] by the eponymous manager [[Matt Busby]] and his assistant [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]], as well as club scout [[Joe Armstrong (football scout)|Joe Armstrong]], who discovered Charlton in 1953 and Best in 1961, among others. Law arrived at the club from Italian team [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] for a club record £115,000 in 1962, having previously played for [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] and [[Manchester derby|rivals]] [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].

Charlton made his debut on 6 October 1956, scoring twice in a 4–2 win against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://stretfordend.co.uk/playermenu/charlton.html |title=Bobby Charlton |access-date=14 December 2014 |work=Stretford End – The Official Statistics Website of Manchester United |archive-date=24 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924123152/http://www.stretfordend.co.uk/playermenu/charlton.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Law made his debut on 18 August 1962, scoring in a 2–2 with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://stretfordend.co.uk/playermenu/law.html |title=Denis Law |access-date=14 December 2014 |work=Stretford End – The Official Statistics Website of Manchester United |archive-date=24 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924132511/http://www.stretfordend.co.uk/playermenu/law.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although Best made his debut against West Bromwich Albion on 14 September 1963,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://stretfordend.co.uk/playermenu/best.html |title=George Best |access-date=14 December 2014 |work=Stretford End – The Official Statistics Website of Manchester United |archive-date=1 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001234125/http://www.stretfordend.co.uk/playermenu/best.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Ashby |first=Ben |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/secrecy-and-delight-george-bests-first-team-debut |title=Secrecy and delight: George Best's first-team debut |date=12 September 2013 |access-date=14 December 2014 |work=[[FourFourTwo]]}}</ref> it wouldn't be until the reverse fixture on 18 January 1964 when all three would feature in the same starting line-up; a 4–1 victory in which all three scored, with Law scoring two of them.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oscroft |first=Tim |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Features/2014/Jan/Manchester-United-recalls-50-years-since-Charlton-Law-and-Best-first-played-together.aspx |title=The Trinity: 50 years on |date=17 January 2014 |access-date=14 December 2014 |work=Manchester United F.C.

Throughout the 1960s all three would be voted as the winner of the [[Ballon d'Or]], the trophy awarded to the world's best player. Law won in [[1964 Ballon d'Or|1964]], Charlton in [[1966 Ballon d'Or|1966]] and Best in [[1968 Ballon d'Or|1968]].

However tough the match was, you always knew Bobby could unleash one of his strikes from God-knows-where, Denis would make something out of nothing inside the box or George would just do something magical.
