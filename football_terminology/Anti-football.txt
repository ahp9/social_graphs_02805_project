"'''Anti-football'''", also known colloquially as '''Haramball''', is a playing style in [[association football]] that emphasizes a highly defensive and aggressive approach, relying mainly on passing and involving the deployment of all team members except the striker behind the ball. The goal of the tactic is to prevent the opposing team from scoring, rather than pursuing an offensive strategy to win the game. Managers known for such tactics include [[José Bordalás]], [[Diego Simeone]], [[José Mourinho]], [[Sean Dyche]], [[Walter Smith]], [[Massimiliano Allegri]], [[Mikel Arteta]], among others.

The term is also used to describe teams that intentionally prevent the game from progressing by kicking the ball forward without attempting to reach any players, engaging in acts of diving and time-wasting, and kicking the ball away during free kicks. Such actions often result in a yellow card by the referee.

[[UEFA]], the governing body of football in [[Europe]], offers a [[UEFA Respect Fair Play ranking|fair play prize]] to teams that prioritize fair play, including avoiding anti-football tactics. Teams that seek to "unlock" the game by playing offensively, taking risks, retaining possession, and avoiding fouls, receive higher fair play scores. The three highest-rated teams in Europe automatically qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] from 1995 to the 2014–15 season. They continue to receive a monetary reward for their fair play.
