[[File:Nogomet Maribor - Varteks 1961 (4).jpg|thumb|A goal being scored (1961)]]
In games of [[association football]], teams compete to score the most '''goals'''. A goal is scored when the [[Ball (association football)|ball]] passes completely over a goal line at either end of the field of play between two centrally positioned upright goal posts 24&nbsp;feet (7.32&nbsp;m) apart and underneath a horizontal crossbar at a height of 8&nbsp;feet (2.44&nbsp;m) — this frame is itself referred to as a [[Football pitch#Goals|goal]]. Each team aims to score at one end of the pitch, while preventing their opponents from scoring at the other end. Nets are usually attached to the goal frame to catch goalscoring balls, but the ball is not required to touch the net.

[[File:Ball in and out of play 2.svg|thumb|If the line in this diagram is the goal line between the goal posts, the only case in which a goal has been scored is position D.]]

Rules concerning goal scoring are described in [[Determining the Outcome of a Match (association football)|Law 10]] of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]:

{{quote|text=A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, between the goalposts and under the crossbar, provided that no [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|offence]] has been committed by the team scoring the goal.|title=Law 10: Determining the Outcome of a Match<ref name="Lotg_2018_91">{{cite web|title=Laws of the Game 2018/19|url=http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/661/065042_170818_LotG_18_19_EN_DoublePage_150dpi_Korr.pdf|website=theifab.com|publisher=IFAB|access-date=2019-01-24|page=91|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125073532/http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/661/065042_170818_LotG_18_19_EN_DoublePage_150dpi_Korr.pdf|archive-date=2019-01-25|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

As with other cases of the ball travelling [[Ball in and out of play|out of the field of play]], all of the ball must cross all of the line, otherwise play continues.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bray|first1=Ken|title=When is a goal not a goal?|url=https://plus.maths.org/content/when-goal-not-goal|website=plus.maths.org|access-date=16 February 2018|language=en}}</ref> A goal is credited to the team attacking the goal scored upon, regardless of which team actually caused the ball to enter the goal. A ball entering a goal from the action of a player defending that goal is called an [[own goal]].

If the ball hits the frame of the goal and remains in play, play continues. Goals can be scored going in off the goal frame.

Even if serious foul play unambiguously prevents a goal from being scored, the [[referee (association football)|referee]] cannot award a goal unless the ball enters the goal as described above; i.e., there is no provision for awarding a goal akin to the [[awarded goal]] in [[ice hockey]], the [[Try (rugby)|penalty try]] in [[rugby football]], or the [[goaltending]] offence in [[basketball]] (although such a provision did once exist, [[Scoring in association football#Goal awarded for handball by opposition|as described below]]).

A goal cannot be scored directly from a [[dropped ball]], [[indirect free kick]] or a [[throw-in]]. Should the ball go into the opponents' goal from these without first being touched by another player, play is restarted with a [[goal kick]]. A player cannot score an own goal directly from ''any'' restart of play (other than, theoretically, a penalty kick); in that case a [[corner kick]] would be awarded. Both of these situations, especially the latter, are exceedingly rare.

As a result of rule changes introduced in 2019, it is not possible to score an attacking goal with the hands or arm.  If a goalkeeper throws the ball directly into the opponent's goal from his/her own penalty area, no goal is awarded; instead a goal-kick is awarded to the defending side.<ref name="keeper_throw"/>  In practice such a situation is improbable given the distances involved, but this can occur in variations of the sport where the Laws are adapted to play on a smaller area.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-07-17 |title=FIFA Puts An End To The Scourge Of Amazing, Impossible Goalkeeper Goals |url=https://deadspin.com/fifa-puts-an-end-to-the-scourge-of-amazing-impossible-1836457655 |access-date=2024-02-09 |website=Deadspin |language=en}}</ref> If the ball goes directly into the opponent's goal from the hands or arm of a player in any other circumstances, the handling is penalised as a [[handball]] offence (even if it was unintentional, or would otherwise have been legal).<ref name="unintentional_handball"/> It remains possible to score an [[own goal]] with the hands or arm.

The 2019 rule changes also provided that a goal cannot be scored if the ball enters either goal directly after touching a match official; a dropped ball is awarded if this occurs.<ref name="Lotg_2018_91" />

If a player or team official is illegally on the field of play when that person's team scores a goal, the goal is disallowed, with a direct free kick being awarded to the opposing side.<ref name="laws_2019_54">[http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/793/103202_200519_LotG_201920_EN_SinglePage.pdf Laws of the Game 2019/20], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603034707/http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/793/103202_200519_LotG_201920_EN_SinglePage.pdf |date=3 June 2019 }}, p. 54.  The detailed reasons given in the laws why a player may be illegally on the field of play are:
* the player has been sent off
* the player has been substituted
* the player is an unused substitute
* the player has left the field of play temporarily, requires the referee's permission to re-enter, and has not received such permission
</ref>

After a goal is scored, play is restarted with a [[kick-off (association football)|kick-off]] by the side which conceded the goal.

===Deciding whether a goal has been scored===
{{see also|Goal-line technology|Video assistant referee}}
Most goals are relatively unambiguous, as the ball will usually strike the net attached to the goal structure indicating that it has passed over the goal line as described above. Occasionally, however, situations occur where it is difficult for officials to tell if the ball completely crossed the goal line before a rebound, save, or clearance from the goal area. Additionally, even if the ball crosses the goal line as required, a goal may be disallowed if the attacking team commits an infringement of the Laws of the Game, such as the [[Offside (association football)|offside offence]] or a [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|foul]].

As with all other decisions on the Laws of the Game, the referee is the final authority as to whether a goal is scored. The match referee is advised by [[assistant referee (association football)|assistant referee]]s, whose view across the pitch from the sidelines may in some cases be more useful in determining whether the ball crossed the goal line or whether the attacking team committed an infringement.

Goals incorrectly awarded or disallowed due to mistakes in determining if the ball crossed the line are referred to as [[ghost goal]]s. The goal net was one of the earliest tools employed to aid match officials in determining whether a goal was scored. Introduced in the 1890s, the goal net provides a simple way to help determine whether the ball passed on the correct side of the goal posts and crossbar. Although not mandated by the Laws of the Game, goal nets are now ubiquitous across most levels of organised football. Since 2012, [[goal-line technology]] has been used at the highest levels of professional football; it employs a system of cameras and/or sensors to provide the referee with a discreet signal when the ball has crossed the goal line.<ref name=IFABofficial>{{cite web|title=IFAB makes three unanimous historic decisions|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2012/m=7/news=ifab-makes-three-unanimous-historic-decisions-1660541.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507234418/http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2012/m=7/news=ifab-makes-three-unanimous-historic-decisions-1660541.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 7, 2015|website=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|access-date=23 April 2015}}</ref> The [[video assistant referee]] was added in 2018 after years of trials; this is an additional assistant referee who constantly monitors video footage of the match and is empowered to advise the referee if he/she makes "clear and obvious errors" in matters, including in the awarding of goals.

==Attribution of goals==
The Laws make no mention of attributing goals to individual players. Nevertheless, goals are almost always attributed to individuals, that player being the one who provided the final action causing the goal to be scored. Generally, this is the last player to touch the ball, notwithstanding inconsequential deflections such as failed attempts at a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|save]]. Should a player cause a goal to be scored against their own team, the goal is recorded as an [[own goal]]. 

The authority on attributing goals varies between competitions. The [[Premier League]] in [[England]] has a dedicated [[Dubious Goals Committee]] for resolving attribution disputes.<ref name="DGC">{{ cite web| first1 = Sean | last1 = Ingle | first2 = Barry | last2 = Glendenning | first3 = James | last3 = Dart | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/aug/23/theknowledge.sport | title = Is there really a Dubious Goals Committee? | work = The Knowledge | publisher = The Guardian | date = 23 August 2006 | access-date = 2010-05-28 }}</ref> 

For an individual player, scoring multiple goals in a game is considered a notable achievement. In association football, a [[hat-trick]] refers to the uncommon feat of scoring three goals in a single game. Awards exist for individual players who score the most goals in some competitions, such awards are often called the "[[Golden Boot (disambiguation)|Golden Boot]]"<!--intentional link to DAB page-->.

While prose match reports have long mentioned when one player contributes to an attack which leads to a goal scored by another, it is only since the 1990s that statistics for such "[[assist (association football)|assist]]s" have been commonly tracked.

==Goal celebrations==
{{mainarticle|Goal celebration}}
[[File:Atlético de Madrid - 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Atlético Madrid]] players celebrate a goal with a group hug]]
Players will typically celebrate scoring a goal with team mates, occasionally putting on elaborate displays for the crowd. The Laws allow this, but mandate that celebration must not be "excessive".<ref name="Lotg_2018_106">{{cite web|title=Laws of the Game 2018/19|url=http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/661/065042_170818_LotG_18_19_EN_DoublePage_150dpi_Korr.pdf|website=theifab.com|publisher=IFAB|access-date=2019-01-24|page=106|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125073532/http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/661/065042_170818_LotG_18_19_EN_DoublePage_150dpi_Korr.pdf|archive-date=2019-01-25|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Players and Goals (Henry Fellows, 1858).jpg|thumb|Illustration of the goals used at Rugby School (1858)]]

===Before 1863===
In [[medieval football|English traditional football]], the object of the game was typically to convey a ball into a specified area, or to touch a specific object (the area or object often being called the "goal")<ref name="cobler">{{cite journal |title=To The Printer |author=The Cobler of Walbrooke |journal=Public Advertiser |date=1766-09-04 |location=London |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18202720/football_memories/ |page=4 |quote= The Gole being fixed, and Two Inns out of Three being to determine who were Conquerors}}.</ref><ref>Strutt (1801)[1810] [https://archive.org/details/gri_33125012252157/page/n173/mode/2up p. 92]: "The goal is usually made with two sticks driven into the ground, about two or three feet apart"</ref><ref>{{cite journal |quote=Having touched with the Ball the appointed Gate Post, the champion who held the ball was immediately hoisted on the necks of his exulting companions [...] |date=1827-02-28 |page=3 |title=The Foot Ball |journal=Derby Mercury |volume=96 |issue=4938}}</ref> defended by the opposing team.

In the more formalised football games of English public schools and universities, the object was typically to kick the ball between goal-posts guarded by the opposition.  This might be required to be above a crossbar (as in the game of football played at [[Rugby School]]),<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of Football as played at Rugby School (1845) |quote=it must go over the bar and between the posts without having touched the dress or person of any player}}</ref> below a bar or other object (as in the [[Sheffield Rules]] of 1862)<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Sheffield Rules (1862)}}</ref> or at any height (as at [[Shrewsbury School]]).<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Description of the Rules of Football as played at Shrewsbury School (1855) |quote=A goal could be kicked at any height.}}</ref>

===The 1863 FA Rules===
The size and type of goals were among the first questions decided by the [[Football Association]] (FA).  At its second meeting, on 10 November 1863, the FA agreed on the following three resolutions:<ref name="resolutions">{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1863) (initial resolutions)}}</ref>

* The goals should be defined by two upright posts without any tape or bar across them.
* That a goal should be scored whenever the ball was kicked between the goalposts or over the space between them.
* That the goal-posts be 8 yards apart.

The next meeting, on 17 November, added the further condition that a goal could not be scored when the ball was "thrown, knocked or carried" between the posts.<ref name="resolutions"/>

These points were reflected in the first draft of the Laws of the Game created by FA secretary [[Ebenezer Cobb Morley|E. C. Morley]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Sporting Life |title=The Football Association |page=3 |date=1863-11-11 |issue=386}}</ref>  Morley's proposal met with objections expressed in correspondence from [[John Charles Thring|J. C. Thring]] of [[Uppingham School]], and also from [[William Chesterman]] of [[Sheffield F. C.]],<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Football Association |journal=Supplement to Bell's Life in London |date=1863-12-05 |page=1 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Football_Association_(Bell%27s_Life_in_London),_1863-12-05.png}}</ref> principally on the grounds that it would be difficult to judge whether a ball that went above the height of the posts should count as a goal; Thring correctly predicted that a crossbar "w[ould] be adopted in the end".<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Football Association |journal=Bell's Life in London |date=1863-12-12 |page=3 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Football_Association_(Bell%27s_Life_in_London)_1863_12_12.png}}</ref>  Nevertheless, this feature of the game was preserved in the Association's first published set of laws, which read:<ref name="laws_1863">{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1863)}}</ref> {{quote|A goal shall be won when the ball passes between the goal posts or over the space between the goal posts (at whatever height), not being thrown, knocked on, or carried}}

===Subsequent developments===

====Introduction of tape / crossbar ====
[[File:England v Scotland 1879.png|thumb|From 1866 to 1883, the laws provided for a tape between the goalposts]]
At the first revision of the FA rules, in 1866, a tape was introduced between the posts at a height of 8 feet, with a goal counting only if the ball went below this tape.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1866) |quote=A goal shall be won when the ball passes between the goal posts under the tape, not being thrown, knocked on, or carried.}}</ref>  According to a contemporary newspaper report of the meeting:<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Bell's Life in London |issue=2288 |page=7 |date=1866-02-24 |title=The Football Association |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Football_Association_(Bell%27s_Life_in_London)_1866-02-24.png}}</ref> {{quote |[[Arthur Pember|The chairman]] urged some strong reasons why a goal should not be won so long as the ball was between the posts at no matter what height, and quoted an instance which occurred at [[Reigate]], where one of the opposite side raised the ball quite 90 feet in the air between the goal posts.  A dispute arose as to whether the goal was won or not, and the bystanders decided that the ball was kicked between the posts, but he thought it was a most unsatisfactory goal, and was therefore decidedly in favour of goals being kicked under the tape}}

In 1875, after a proposal by [[Queen's Park FC]], the laws allowed the option of using either a crossbar or tape.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1875)}}</ref> At the [[International Football Conference]] of December 1882, it was decided to require a crossbar;<ref>{{cite journal |title=National Football Conference in Manchester |journal= Glasgow Herald |volume= 100 |issue=292 |page=5 |date=1882-12-07 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:National_Football_Conference_In_Manchester_(Glasgow_Herald)_1887-12-07.png }}</ref>  this change was introduced into the Football Association's laws in 1883.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1883)}}</ref>

The dimensions of the goal (8 yards wide and 8 feet high) have remained unchanged since 1866.

====Use of hands to score a goal====
The original FA laws of 1863 disallowed a goal when the ball was "thrown, knocked on, or carried",<ref name="laws_1863"/>  even if the handling was otherwise legal.<ref>"Knocking on" was not banned from general play until 1867 -- see {{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1867)}}</ref> In 1882, a change in the laws, introduced by [[Nicholas Lane Jackson]] of [[Finchley F.C.|Finchley FC]] and [[Morton Betts]] of [[Harrow Chequers F.C.|Old Harrovians FC]], made it possible to score an [[own goal]] by use of the hands.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1882) |quote=A goal shall be won when the ball has passed between the goal-posts under the tape or bar, not being thrown, knocked on nor carried '''by anyone of the attacking side'''}} [emphasis added]</ref>

In 1962, a change introduced by the [[Scottish Football Association]] permitted a goal-keeper to score a goal by throwing the ball into the opposing goal from his own penalty area.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1962min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1962 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |page=3 |access-date=2019-01-24 |quote=provided [the ball] has not been thrown, carried, or propelled by hand or arm, by a player of the attacking side, except in the case of a goal-keeper, who is within his own penalty area |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125073444/https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1962min.pdf |archive-date=2019-01-25 |url-status=live }} [emphasis added]</ref> This innovation was heavily criticised in some quarters.<ref>e.g. {{cite journal |title=Now Goalkeepers May Turn into Goalthrowers! |date=1962-07-07 |page=32 |first=Harry |last=Gee |journal=Coventry Evening Telegraph |issue=22107}}</ref> In 1974, a further change to the laws allowed a goal to be scored when the ball was handled unintentionally by an attacker.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1974min.pdf |title=International Football Association Board: 1974 Minutes of the Annual General Meeting |page=6 |access-date=2019-01-24 |quote=provided [the ball] has not been thrown, carried, or intentionally propelled by hand or arm, by a player of the attacking side |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125183146/https://ssbra.org/ifab/assets/pdf/1974min.pdf |archive-date=2019-01-25 |url-status=live }} [emphasis added]</ref> In 2019 both of these changes were reversed:

* it was specified that a goalkeeper cannot score against the opposing team by throwing the ball directly into goal from his/her own penalty area.  Should the ball go into the opponents' net in these circumstances, a goal-kick is awarded to the defending team.<ref name="keeper_throw">{{cite web |url=http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/793/103202_200519_LotG_201920_EN_SinglePage.pdf |page=162 |title=Laws of the Game 2019/20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603034707/http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/793/103202_200519_LotG_201920_EN_SinglePage.pdf |archive-date=3 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Goal awarded for handball by opposition====
The original laws of the game, in 1863, specified no punishments for infringements of the rules.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1863)}}</ref>  In 1872, the [[indirect free kick]] was introduced as a punishment for handball.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1872)}}</ref>  This indirect free-kick was thought to be an inadequate remedy for a handball which prevented an otherwise-certain goal.  From a meeting of the [[Sheffield & Hallamshire County Football Association|Sheffield Football Association]] in February 1879, we have the following report:<ref>{{cite book|first=Brendan|last=Murphy|title=From Sheffield with Love|year=2007|publisher=Sports Book Limited|isbn=978-1-899807-56-7|page=107}}</ref><ref>Note: although the Sheffield Association had adopted the FA laws in 1877, it continued to independently consider proposals for new changes to the laws until 1883</ref> {{quote|It was proposed by Mr. T. Banks, on behalf of the [[Norfolk F.C.|Norfolk Club]], to add to law 8 — "If any player of the defending side, except the goalkeeper, stop the ball with his hands within three yards of the goal, when it is going in goal, it shall count a goal to the opponents."<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Sheffield Daily Telegraph |date=1879-02-18 |page=7 |title=Sheffield Football Association |issue=7386}}</ref>}}After a "long and noisy discussion", the change was rejected.

At the 1881 meeting of the [[Football Association]], a similar proposal was introduced by J. Arnall and J. B. Clayton of the [[Birmingham Football Association]], but it was likewise rejected.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Bell's Life in London |issue=3162 |page=10 |date=1881-02-05 |title=The Football Association |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Football_Association_(Bell%27s_Life_in_London)_1881-02-05.png}}</ref>  Such a law was finally approved the next year, to become part of the FA's laws for the 1882-83 season: {{quote|When any player, other than the goal-keeper, wilfully stops a ball in the vicinity of his own goal by using his hands when, in the opinion of the umpires or referee, the ball would have passed through the goal, a goal shall be scored to his opponents.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1882)}}</ref>}}
This goal, which was similar to today's [[Try (rugby)|penalty try]] in [[rugby football|rugby]], survived as part of the game for only one season.  At the [[International Football Conference]] of December 1882, it was decided to remove this law from the 1883-84 season.<ref>{{cite journal |title=National Football Conference in Manchester |journal= Glasgow Herald |volume= 100 |issue=292 |page=5 |date=1882-12-07 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:National_Football_Conference_In_Manchester_(Glasgow_Herald)_1887-12-07.png }}</ref><ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Laws of the Game (1883)}}</ref>  One commentator wrote that the rule "was the means of causing the referee a very awkward point to decide at times, and we all know the duties of the referee are heavy enough without this; and, further, the penalty, in my opinion, is too great [...]  A free kick [...] is quite sufficient".<ref>{{cite journal| author=Lancastrian |title=The Football Association Conference |journal= Athletic News and Cyclist's Journal |volume=vii |issue=38.3 |page=5 |date=1882-12-13 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Association_Football_Conference_(Athletic_News)_1882-12-13.png}}</ref>

====Goal scored from set-piece====
{{further|Kick-off (association football)#History|Dropped-ball#History|Free kick (association football)#History|Penalty kick (association football)#History|Throw-in#History|Goal kick#History|Corner kick#History}}
The laws have at various times restricted the ability to score from a [[Set piece (football)|set piece]] situation (such as a free kick or corner-kick). If the ball goes into the goal directly from such a restart but the laws do not permit the awarding of a goal, depending on which team performed the set piece a goal kick or corner kick is awarded.
