'''''{{lang|es|Galácticos}}''''' (Spanish for '''''galactics''''', referring to superstars) are expensive, world-famous [[Association football|football]] players recruited during the "''galácticos''" policy pursued by [[Florentino Pérez]] during his presidency at [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]], where in his first tenure between 2000 and 2006, he purchased at least one ''galáctico'' in the summer of every year. The club's second ''galáctico era'' began in 2009 with Pérez's return to presidency, and is considered to be more successful both economically and in terms of on-pitch achievements.<ref name="scroll.in">{{cite web|title=For Real Madrid, Galacticos 2.0 has proven to be more successful than its predecessor|url=https://scroll.in/field/839553/for-real-madrid-galacticos-2-0-has-proven-to-be-more-successful-than-its-predecessor|work=Vyasa Shastry|publisher=scroll.in|date=3 June 2017}}</ref><ref name="SOED">{{cite book|title = Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|date =2007|location = Oxford, UK|isbn = 978-0199206872|publisher = Oxford University Press}}</ref>

The term itself carries both positive and negative connotations. Initially, it was used to emphasise the greatness of the superstar players being signed and the construction of a world-class team. Later, the term developed a more negative connotation, with ''galáctico'' becoming associated with [[prima donna]] and being used to deride the transfer policy and team built under it, following media perception that the policy at Real in the early 2000s had failed to deliver the expected levels of success.

The term has occasionally been used to describe other teams, both in football and in other sports, that have been perceived to follow a similar policy. For example, British [[rugby union]] commentator [[Martin Gillingham]] called [[Top 14|French]] club [[RC Toulonnais|Toulon]] "rugby's ''galácticos''" in 2012 due to a wave of signings of international stars by owner [[Mourad Boudjellal]].<ref name=Gillingham>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/03/27/top-14-toulon-are-the-galacticos-of-the-rugby-world/ |title=Top 14: Toulon are the Galácticos of the rugby world |first=Martin |last=Gillingham |work=[[The Independent]] |date=2012-03-27 |access-date=2012-06-06 |location=London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331061211/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/03/27/top-14-toulon-are-the-galacticos-of-the-rugby-world/ |archive-date=2012-03-31 }}</ref>

==Origins==
Although the term was popularized in the 2000s, the origins of the ''Galáctico'' policy date as far back as the 1950s and 1960s, when the policy was first founded by club-president [[Santiago Bernabéu Yeste|Santiago Bernabéu]]. Bernabéu signed multiple star players for large fees in quick succession, such as [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]], [[Francisco Gento]], [[Raymond Kopa]], [[Héctor Rial]], [[Ferenc Puskás]] and [[José Santamaría]]. This period of buying allowed Real Madrid to enjoy their finest era of dominance, winning twelve [[La Liga]] championships and six [[European Cup]]s.

The ''Galácticos'' transfer policy was contrasted with the ''[[Quinta del Buitre]]'' era of the late 1980s. This saw Real Madrid playing a more physical and less appealing style of football, and had an increased emphasis on producing homegrown players such as [[Emilio Butragueño]], [[Manolo Sanchís]], [[Rafael Martín Vázquez]], [[Míchel (footballer, born 1963)|Míchel]] and [[Miguel Pardeza]]. This period allowed Real Madrid to also enjoy domestic and European success, winning five La Liga championships and two [[UEFA Cup]]s.

The term ''Galácticos'' in reference to this team is often credited to [[Jaume Ortí]], president of [[Valencia CF]], who challenged Real Madrid to honours in the early 2000s. The term in general goes back further, with ''[[Mundo Deportivo]]'' finding a reference in 1988 describing [[FC Barcelona]] signing [[Julio Salinas]] as a ''Galáctico''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Muñoz |first1=Xavier |title=El término fichaje ‘Galáctico’ lo acuñó MD en 1988|trans-title=The term 'Galáctico' signing was coined by ''Mundo Deportivo'' in 1988 |url=https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20190521/462374787992/el-termino-fichaje-galactico-lo-acuno-md-en-1988.html |access-date=29 July 2024 |work=[[Mundo Deportivo]] |date=21 May 2019 |language=Spanish}}</ref>

==First ''galáctico'' era==
[[File:Football against poverty 2014 - Ronaldo (3).jpg|thumb|upright|€108&nbsp;million was spent by Real Madrid to sign [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] and [[Luís Figo]] (2014 image) in the early 2000s.]]

The first ''galáctico'' era is considered to be synonymous with the presidency of [[Florentino Pérez]] between 2000&ndash;2006, from the signing of [[Luís Figo]] in 2000, to the departure of [[Zinedine Zidane]] in 2006. The first Pérez era brought:

* {{flagicon|Portugal}} [[Luís Figo]] – signed in 2000 for €60&nbsp;million from [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].
* {{flagicon|France}} [[Zinedine Zidane]] – signed in 2001 for €73.5&nbsp;million from [[Juventus FC|Juventus]].
* {{flagicon|Brazil}} [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] – signed in 2002 for €45&nbsp;million from [[Inter Milan|Inter]].
* {{flagicon|England}} [[David Beckham]] – signed in 2003 for €37.5&nbsp;million from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].
* {{flagicon|England}} [[Michael Owen]] – signed in 2004 for €9&nbsp;million from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].
* {{flagicon|Brazil}} [[Robinho]] – signed in 2005 for €24&nbsp;million from [[Santos FC|Santos]].
* {{flagicon|Spain}} [[Sergio Ramos]] – signed in 2005 for €27&nbsp;million from [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]].

Several other players were often considered to be a part of the ''galácticos'' legacy due to their influence on the team during that period, despite being signed previously to the reign of Pérez, or being graduates of the youth system. These included:
* {{flagicon|Spain}} [[Fernando Hierro]] – signed pre-Pérez in 1989 for €1&nbsp;million from [[Real Valladolid|Valladolid]].
* {{flagicon|Spain}} [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl]] – graduated from youth system in 1994.
* {{flagicon|Spain}} [[Guti (Spanish footballer)|Guti]] – graduated from youth system in 1995.
* {{flagicon|Brazil}} [[Roberto Carlos]] – signed pre-Pérez in 1996 for €3.5&nbsp;million from [[Inter Milan|Inter]].
* {{flagicon|Spain}} [[Fernando Morientes]] – signed pre-Pérez in 1997 for €6.6&nbsp;million from [[Real Zaragoza|Zaragoza]].
* {{flagicon|Spain}} [[Iván Helguera]] – signed pre-Pérez in 1999 for €4.5&nbsp;million from [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]].
* {{flagicon|Spain}} [[Míchel Salgado]] – signed pre-Pérez in 1999 for €11&nbsp;million from [[Celta de Vigo|Celta]].
* {{flagicon|England}} [[Steve McManaman]] – signed pre-Pérez in 1999 for free-transfer from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].
* {{flagicon|Spain}} [[Iker Casillas]] – graduated from youth system in 1999.

==2000–2006: Pérez's first presidency==
Though Real Madrid had already won two [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]] in 1998 and 2000 under the presidency of [[Lorenzo Sanz]], Sanz lost his re-election bid to Pérez. Pérez won by promising an aggressive new transfer policy and expensive new signings, in particular, Luís Figo from [[El Clásico|rivals]] Barcelona.

Pérez then sold the club's training ground, the [[Ciudad Deportiva, Madrid|Ciudad Deportiva]], for €480&nbsp;million, allowing Real to clear debts, and build a replacement training complex at a fraction of the cost. It also allowed for significant funds to be used for player transfers. The deal to sell the complex was later investigated by the EU on illegal-competition grounds, however, no charges were brought.

After the purchase of Figo for €62&nbsp;million, a world-record transfer fee, Pérez sought to buy at least one world-class superstar player (dubbed a ''galáctico'') each summer. The record was broken a year later by the purchase of [[Zinedine Zidane]] from [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] for €75&nbsp;million. After a demand for youth integration in the side, which coincided with the appointment of [[Vicente del Bosque]], the policy was redubbed as "''Zidanes y Pavones''", with the name deriving from Zidane and [[Francisco Pavón]], a product from the club's youth academy — the idea was to sign one major superstar per year, and promote youth players sporadically.

[[Florentino Pérez]] was also fond of [[Francesco Totti]], a world-class [[trequartista]] (attacking midfielder) who played for [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] at the time, and tried to sign him in order to perfect the galácticos squad, but was rejected, as the Italian number 10 remained out of loyalty to his Roman club.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2016/09/27/57ea2da022601dfe228b456d.html|title = Real Madrid's Galactico that never was|date = 27 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.as.com/en/2018/11/27/football/1543320693_705355.html|title=Totti: "In some parallel universe, I was Sergio Ramos' captain"|date=27 November 2018}}</ref> Totti has stated in an interview that the Los Blancos even sent him "a No.10 shirt with ‘Totti’ on it" to show their earnestness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asroma.com/en/news/2018/9/totti-on-new-champions-league-campaign-rejecting-real-ballon-d-or-race-and-more?tdsourcetag=s_pctim_aiomsg|title=Totti on new Champions League campaign, rejecting Real, Ballon d'Or race and more|access-date=2019-06-19|archive-date=2020-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812042735/https://www.asroma.com/en/news/2018/9/totti-on-new-champions-league-campaign-rejecting-real-ballon-d-or-race-and-more?tdsourcetag=s_pctim_aiomsg|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Initial success===
Immediate success followed for three seasons, with Real winning La Liga in 2000&ndash;01 and 2002&ndash;03, and claiming the [[UEFA Champions League]] in [[2001–02 UEFA Champions League|2001&ndash;02]], with Zidane scoring the winning goal in [[2002 UEFA Champions League Final|the final]]. After winning the 2002&ndash;03 La Liga title, Real Madrid added English midfielder [[David Beckham]] from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for €35&nbsp;million. Beckham's status as a world-class footballer, in addition to his heavily publicized marriage to pop star [[Victoria Beckham|Victoria Adams]], resulted in Real Madrid gaining great advertising potential around the world, especially in Asia. By further promoting the other superstar players in various marketing campaigns in the continent, the club became the world's richest club in terms of revenue in 2005&ndash;06.

Despite expectations of continued dominance in domestic and European competition, the club failed to win any trophy for the next three seasons. They also suffered from elimination in the UEFA Champions League, exiting in the 2004 quarter-finals, and two consecutive exits in Round of 16 in 2005 and 2006. In the same period, Barcelona won successive La Liga titles in 2005 and 2006, along with the Champions League in [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League|2006]].

===Perceived failure===
Several reasons have been proposed in the media for the failure of the ''galáctico'' policy:

* A lack of interest in defensive talent harmed the team, as potential transfers were overlooked because Pérez did not want to pay large wages to defensive players. Shortly after signing Beckham, [[Claude Makélélé]] departed the team when the club refused to raise his relatively low salary, despite him being widely considered as one of the best defensive midfielders in the world and key to the team. Negotiations to sign [[Patrick Vieira]] from [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 2004 failed for similar reasons. The defensive players signed by Pérez during this period, namely [[Walter Samuel]], [[Thomas Gravesen]], [[Jonathan Woodgate]], [[Cicinho]], [[Carlos Diogo]] and [[Pablo Gabriel García|Pablo García]], all for high fees, underperformed while playing for the club, with Woodgate seeming the only potential success, his time being compounded by severe injuries. [[Sergio Ramos]], who joined Real Madrid for €27&nbsp;million in the summer of 2005 from [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]], failed to shine until Pérez's departure in 2006. Pavón, one-half of the ''Zidanes y Pavones'' policy, never lived up to expectation and left the club in 2007.
* The shock firing of coach [[Vicente del Bosque]], who won two Champions League titles, and led Real Madrid to their 29th league championship in the 2002&ndash;03 season. It has been suggested that there was a political split, with del Bosque and his players (namely Hierro, Morientes, [[Steve McManaman]] and Makélélé), against the policy Pérez instituted. Three of the aforementioned players had backed a significant wage raise for Makélélé, and they all left the club shortly after del Bosque's departure. More importantly, del Bosque was able to balance the many different egos of the players in the star studded team, considering that several ''galácticos'' were all competing for the same position. Without del Bosque, the superstar players placed together failed to form a cohesive footballing unit, indicating that having a large number of very talented, renowned individual footballers did not effectively translate into a great footballing team.
* Lack of stability and interference by Pérez, who appointed [[Carlos Queiroz]], an assistant manager at United, in the week following the arrival of Beckham and dismissal of del Bosque. Queiroz was allegedly forced to pick the star players, regardless of form or performance on the pitch in order to maximise on marketing potential, and had limited input into tactical decisions. McManaman later described this as the "Disneyfication of Real Madrid" in his autobiography. Queiroz was later fired after only one trophyless season in 2003&ndash;04, with Real suffering in subsequent years from high turnover in non-playing staff, with four managers and four directors of football in the four years following del Bosque's firing in 2003.
* Signings for non-footballing (marketing) reasons, namely in regards to Beckham. Beckham, a natural right winger, joined the club partly due to his huge popularity in Asia. This meant Figo, another right winger already at the club, had to compete for a starting berth at the club. The signings of two high-profile players in the same position meant one or the other was forced to play out of position in many games, with Beckham in central-defensive midfield when Figo was on the right, or Figo on the left or centre when Beckham occupied the right. One former club director also reportedly quoted saying that Beckham was signed for his good looks and [[Ronaldinho]], who joined Barcelona the same summer, was too "ugly" to play for Real Madrid. While Real Madrid failed to win any trophy for three straight seasons, Ronaldinho would lead the powerful resurgence of Barcelona; and furthermore he proved to be one of the most marketable players during that time.
* The 2003 pre-season Asian tour catered more to the needs of the club's marketing than to its players' preparations. Shortly after Beckham joined the club, the team embarked on an 18-day summer tour in Asia, to cash in on his worldwide appeal. It included exhibition matches in Beijing, Tokyo, Hong Kong and [[Bangkok]], which alone earned the club €10&nbsp;million. Some have compared this tour with the first visit of [[The Beatles]] to the United States in 1964. Although lucrative and generating wide publicity, the preparation value of preseason in Asia was questionable, as the team failed to adequately prepare for the following season. It was exhausting for the players, as endless rounds of publicity engagements and restrictions on the players' freedom of movement (due to the team hotel being besieged by fans). Most players admitted that they would have preferred a low-profile training camp and/or to have been home in Spain for the pre-season, instead of playing meaningless show matches against low quality opponents.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/2003/08/11/real_home/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030815092824/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/2003/08/11/real_home/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=August 15, 2003 | work=CNN | title=Globetrotters Real back at base after Asian tour}}</ref>
* Poor transfer decisions, namely in regards to [[Samuel Eto'o]]. Real Madrid owned 50% of the contract Eto'o signed with [[RCD Mallorca|Mallorca]] since 1998, and had first preference over where he could sign if he chose to leave Mallorca. Pérez sold these rights to Eto'o in 2004, arguing that Real Madrid already had the best two strikers in the league ([[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] and Raúl), and that there was no place for another forward. Eto'o himself also ruled out a move back to the club for similar reasons, despite Real Madrid signing another forward in [[Michael Owen]] that same summer. Eto'o would later join Barcelona, and lead them to 2004&ndash;05, 2005&ndash;06 and 2008&ndash;09 [[La Liga]] titles, as well as 2005&ndash;06 and 2008&ndash;09 Champions League titles. Meanwhile, Owen, the alternative signing to Eto'o, left after one season after failing to secure a starting berth at Real.

===End of the first era===
The decline in the team's on-field performance had seemingly hit a nadir in the [[2005–06 Real Madrid CF season|2005&ndash;06 season]], crashing out of the [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the Round of 16 without scoring a goal in either [[Two-legged match|leg]]. Despite the new signings, which included [[Júlio Baptista]] (€24&nbsp;million), [[Robinho]] (€30&nbsp;million), and [[Sergio Ramos]] (€27&nbsp;million),<ref>[http://www.marca.com/2014/05/17/en/football/spanish_football/1400326984.html "Alberto Moreno angling for Real Madrid move"]. Marca. Retrieved 23 August 2014</ref> Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.<ref>{{cite news|title=Real Madrid 0–3 Barcelona|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4441406.stm|access-date=26 July 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=19 November 2005}}</ref> Madrid's coach [[Vanderlei Luxemburgo|Wanderley Luxemburgo]] was sacked the following month and his replacement was [[Juan Ramón López Caro]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Real Madrid sack coach Luxemburgo |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4497208.stm |access-date=26 July 2014 |work=BBC Sport |date=4 December 2005}}</ref> A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the [[2005–06 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]] semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,<ref>{{cite news |title=Real Madrid concede six in defeat |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4695456.stm |access-date=26 July 2014 |work=BBC Sport |date=8 February 2006}}</ref> a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. This foresaw Pérez resigning as club president on February 27, 2006, and was succeeded by [[Ramón Calderón]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4757112.stm |title=Perez resigns as Madrid president |work=BBC Sport |date=27 February 2006 |access-date=7 January 2012}}</ref>

The final season of the ''galáctico'' era is considered to be the [[2006–07 Real Madrid CF season|2006&ndash;07 season]]. [[Fabio Cannavaro]] and [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] were brought in for a combined fee of €21&nbsp;million, while Zidane and Ronaldo both departed, with the former retiring. The incoming transfers were notable in the fact that less media attention or marketing was involved in the signing of these players; Cannavaro had been fresh off captaining Italy to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], but had left Juventus after it was relegated to [[Serie B]], while Van Nistelrooy had fallen out of favour at Manchester United. Both signings were seen as needed for the team, which lacked stability in both attack and defence in the season prior.

Following Pérez's departure, Calderón hired [[Fabio Capello]] with a mandate of "reining in the players and clearing out dead wood". Capello balanced the team out and moved away from the ''galáctico'' approach enforced previously, with Capello famously dropping Beckham for periods of the season, due to form and inability to be integrated into the starting eleven. However, Beckham was returned to the team during the second half of the season, and was widely considered by many to be one of their better performers at the time. The team's performance in the Champions League still disappointed, with their elimination to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] on the [[away goals rule]]: the team initially enjoyed a 3–2 first leg win at home, but lost the second leg away 2–1, with [[Roberto Carlos]] failing to control the ball on kickoff which led to [[Roy Makaay]] scoring in 10.12 seconds, the fastest Champions League goal in history. Domestically, the team finally overtook Barcelona and won La Liga, but Capello was sacked at the conclusion of the season.

The nail in the coffin of the end of the first ''galáctico'' era is considered to be the departure of Beckham to join [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) side [[LA Galaxy]] after the 2006&ndash;07 season.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6732583.stm | publisher=BBC News | first=John | last=Sinnott | title=LA deal revived Beckham – Antic | date=10 June 2007}}</ref> Beckham's contract was due to expire after that season, and Calderón favored re-signing him, however, Beckham derided his treatment, and benching, by Capello, who later responded publicly saying that Beckham would get no further chances on the first team, although he was later forced to backtrack on that declaration.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6248514.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Real Madrid sack manager Capello | date=28 June 2007}}</ref> Beckham was also the last of the big four to move on, with Figo having joined [[Inter Milan]] two seasons prior, Zidane retiring after the 2006 World Cup, and Ronaldo moving to [[A.C. Milan]] half a season before Beckham's departure. Capello was then replaced by [[Bernd Schuster]], who led the team to the second consecutive La Liga title in [[2007–08 Real Madrid CF season|2007–08]] and a [[Supercopa de España]] at the beginning of the [[2008–09 Real Madrid CF season|2008–09 season]]. However, Madrid continued to fail in the Champions League, with consecutive round of 16 exits, and couldn't produce stable results on the domestic front either, with multiple early Copa del Rey eliminations and Barcelona regaining dominance in the La Liga.

Several other players are considered to be a part of the ''galácticos'' legacy due to their influence on the team during that period despite either being signed previously to Pérez's presidency, being graduates of the Madrid youth system, or being players more focused on defending than attacking; these often include:
* {{flagicon|Spain}} [[Iker Casillas]] – part of the first ''galácticos''.

==2009–2018: Pérez's second presidency==
===Background: 2008–09 season===
The 2008–09 season saw Real Madrid eclipsed by rivals Barcelona, who completed their [[Treble (association football)|treble]], including beating Real to win La Liga by a wide margin of nine points. Real were humbled in the Champions League first knockout round by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], suffering a 1–0 loss at the Santiago Bernabéu and a heavy 4–0 defeat at [[Anfield]]. The defeat marked the fifth successive season of early Champions League exits in the round of 16, with Real not making the quarter-finals since 2004. To make things worse, they lost both their ''[[El Clásico]]'' matches and crashed out of the Copa del Rey to [[Segunda División B|third tier]] side [[Real Unión]]. The team was widely derided in the press. Manager Bernd Schuster was sacked midway through the 2008–09 season, with the team perceptibly in decline despite the efforts of [[Juande Ramos]], who kept the team with 19 successive victories, shortening the deficit to only six points (initially, Barcelona led by 12). It was all brought to an end when a rampant Barcelona later defeated an exposed Real 2–6, with [[Lionel Messi]], [[Xavi (footballer, born 1980)|Xavi]] and [[Thierry Henry]] being the stars.

In addition, Real Madrid president Ramón Calderón resigned in January 2009 after corruption allegations and having failed to secure notable transfer targets for the club.

===2009–10 season===
The resignation of Ramón Calderón resulted in a presidential election in mid-2009, returning Florentino Pérez to the presidency. Pérez again pledged to go on a spending spree to return the club to European and domestic competitiveness, notably with his vocal claims of an attempt to sign AC Milan's [[Kaká]]. Just 24 hours after his appointment, [[Manuel Pellegrini]] was unveiled as Juande Ramos' replacement as manager. After much speculation linking him to the club, Kaká was duly signed for a then-world record fee of £56&nbsp;million on 9 June 2009.

Then, on 11 June, Manchester United revealed they had accepted a shock offer of £80&nbsp;million (a new world record transfer fee) for [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]. United gave Real until 30 June to complete the deal, and on 26 June, Real Madrid and United signed the final agreement for the transfer of Ronaldo, which became effective on 1 July. That same day, it was confirmed that [[Olympique Lyonnais]] had accepted an offer from Madrid for [[Karim Benzema]]. On 29 July 2009, it was announced that Real and Liverpool had reached an agreement for the transfer of [[Álvaro Arbeloa]] to the Spanish club for a fee of €4&nbsp;million, the same amount Liverpool paid for the player in January 2007; Arbeloa subsequently signed a five-year contract with Real.

On 4 August, Real Madrid and Liverpool again agreed terms for the transfer of [[Xabi Alonso]] to the Santiago Bernabéu for a fee of €34&nbsp;million. Other players that came to Real Madrid included [[Raúl Albiol]], [[Ezequiel Garay]] and [[Esteban Granero]]. [[Antonio Adán]] became the third goalkeeper through the youth system. Newly hired manager Manuel Pellegrini was under heavy pressure to deliver instant success following the high-profile off-season signings.<ref>[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2016193-misery-in-madrid-means-manuel-pellegrini-is-under-the-most-title-race-pressure#articles/2016193-misery-in-madrid-means-manuel-pellegrini-is-under-the-most-title-race-pressure "Pellegrini is under pressure"].

In their first year, the second era of ''galácticos'' failed to win any trophies. They were [[Alcorconazo|crushed 4–0]] against [[AD Alcorcón|Alcorcón]] in the [[2009–10 Copa del Rey#Round of 32|Copa del Rey]] (ultimately losing 4–1 on aggregate), then were knocked out of the [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League#Round of 16|Champions League]] in the round of 16 for the sixth consecutive year (losing to Lyon 2–1 on aggregate), after which Pellegrini received an ultimatum from club president Pérez that Real would have to win La Liga or he would be sacked. Ending the domestic season, Real Madrid set a club record of 96 points, with 31 wins and 102 goals scored, but nonetheless finished second in [[2009–10 La Liga|La Liga]] to defending champions Barcelona. Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of [[Big Five (association football)|Europe's top five leagues]], until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in [[2018–19 Premier League|2018–19]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2023936-manchester-united-real-madrid-and-european-footballs-greatest-ever-runners-up|title=Manchester United, Real Madrid and European Football's Greatest-Ever Runners-Up|publisher=[[Bleacher Report]]|first=Nicky|last=Bandini|date=10 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="Bleacher Report">{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/708610-92-points-not-good-enough-for-real-madrid-to-win-la-liga|title=92 Points Not Good Enough for Real Madrid to Win La Liga|publisher=[[Bleacher Report]]|access-date=19 July 2022}}</ref>

Once again, Real Madrid suffered from poor transfer decisions, as [[Wesley Sneijder]] and [[Arjen Robben]], who were transferred to Inter Milan and Bayern Munich respectively because they were considered surplus to requirements, each played key roles as their clubs reached the [[2010 UEFA Champions League Final|2010 Champions League final]] at the Santiago Bernabéu.

===2010–11 season===
Manuel Pellegrini was sacked and [[José Mourinho]] was appointed manager. Even before the 2009–10 season had concluded, the team was actively courting Mourinho, who had successfully managed Inter Milan to a final victory over Barça in the Champions League (''Los Blancos'' fans were pleased that this denied Barça the opportunity to win the Champions League at the Bernabéu<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/sid_lowe/04/29/real.celebrate/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503160750/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/sid_lowe/04/29/real.celebrate/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=May 3, 2010 | work=CNN | title=Madrid revels in Barcelona's exit | date=30 April 2010}}</ref>) en route to achieving a continental treble. Mourinho was released by Inter after a record-breaking compensation package was agreed on 27 May 2010.

Though a manager and not a player, Mourinho has often been referred to as a ''galáctico''. He was in high demand as a football manager for his past successes, having earlier in his career led an unfancied [[FC Porto|Porto]] to consecutive European trophies, then at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and Inter took underachieving squads to domestic and European successes. While Real Madrid wanted to make his arrival a media frenzy, Mourinho vetoed the club's plans which supposedly would have involved a giant catwalk or parading a massive white shirt across the pitch. Florentino Pérez was absent during the simple media presentation announcing Mourinho's appointment; only director general [[Jorge Valdano]], the media and Mourinho were present. This suggested an apparent power shift, with Real Madrid "having at long last allowed a coach [Mourinho] the freedom to build the squad".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/7791398/Jose-Mourinho-begins-Real-Madrid-revolution.html|work=The Telegraph|title=Jose Mourinho begins Real Madrid revolution|date=1 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/7791398/Jose-Mourinho-begins-Real-Madrid-revolution.html | location=London | work=The Telegraph | first=Sid | last=Lowe | title=Jose Mourinho begins Real Madrid revolution | date=1 June 2010}}</ref>

Real Madrid continued the spending spree by signing players [[Ángel Di María]], [[Sergio Canales]], [[Pedro León]], [[Ricardo Carvalho]], [[Sami Khedira]] and [[Mesut Özil]]. Khedira and Özil had just earlier played key roles in [[Germany national football team|Germany]]'s third-place finish at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].
<!--DONT INCLUDE RUMOURS, ONLY ACTUAL SIGNINGS.-->
On 20 April 2011, the second ''galácticos'' era managed to win their first trophy, a 1–0 victory over [[2010–11 FC Barcelona season|Barcelona]] in the [[2011 Copa del Rey Final|final]] of the [[Copa del Rey]], with [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] scoring the decisive goal in extra time. They also managed to get past the round of 16 of the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|UEFA Champions League]] for the first time in seven years, reaching the semi-finals where they lost to eventual champions Barça. In [[2010–11 La Liga|La Liga]], they finished as runners-up to Barça with 92 points, being defeated 0–5 in the 13th round, and drawing 1–1 in the 32nd round, thus achieving their first point in the last six matches against the ''Azulgranas''.

May 2011 saw the appointment of former ''galáctico'' Zinedine Zidane as general manager of the club, replacing Jorge Valdano.

===2011–12 season===
In the [[2011–12 Real Madrid CF season|2011–12 season]], Real Madrid won its 32nd title, under the management of José Mourinho, with a national record of 100 points, a record 121 goals scored, a record goal difference of +89 and the most away wins among several other records in a single La Liga season. The key moment was the 2–1 win over Barça at [[Nou Camp]] on 21 April, Barça's first home loss of the season, which extended Real Madrid's lead in the table to seven points with four matches left, and led to Barça coach [[Pep Guardiola]] conceding the league title. In the Champions League, the team reached the semi-finals where they faced Bayern Munich (managed by [[Jupp Heynckes]], who had previously led Real Madrid to its 1998 Champions League title), losing the first leg 2–1 and winning the second leg at home 2–1 (with former Real Madrid player Arjen Robben converting a penalty to level the aggregate score). Bayern won 3–1 in the ensuing penalty shootout which saw spot kicks of ''galácticos'' Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaká saved by Bayern's [[Manuel Neuer]], as well as a missed penalty by [[Sergio Ramos]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/champions-league/9226202/Real-Madrid-2-Bayern-Munich-1-agg-3-3-Bayern-win-3-1-on-pens-match-report.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425225935/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/champions-league/9226202/Real-Madrid-2-Bayern-Munich-1-agg-3-3-Bayern-win-3-1-on-pens-match-report.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 April 2012 |title=Bayern Munich reach Champions League final after beating Real Madrid in dramatic penalty shoot-out |publisher=Telegraph |date= 26 April 2012|access-date=2012-05-19 |location=London |first=Henry |last=Winter}}</ref>

===2012–13 season===
Real Madrid started the [[2012–13 Real Madrid CF season|2012–13 season]] by winning the [[2012 Supercopa de España|Supercopa de España]], defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to winning them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in [[2012–13 La Liga|La Liga]], accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by [[Borussia Dortmund]] 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the [[2012–13 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]] in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the [[2013 Copa del Rey Final|final]], which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to [[Atlético Madrid]] 1–2 [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|a.e.t.]] in the final in a heartbreaking fashion. A major transfer of the season was the signing of [[Luka Modrić]] from [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a fee in the region of £33&nbsp;million. After the loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by "mutual agreement".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22583729|title=Jose Mourinho: Real Madrid boss to leave next month|publisher=BBC|date=20 May 2013}}</ref> Real Madrid beat Barcelona in three of their six meetings that season (2–1 in Supercopa at home, 3–1 in the Copa del Rey away, 2–1 in the league at home), drawing two (2–2 in the league away, 1–1 in the Copa del Rey at home) and losing once (2–3 in the Supercopa away). The most striking victory came in the [[2012–13 Copa del Rey]] semi-finals where Madrid knocked out [[2011–12 Copa del Rey|defending champions]] Barcelona 4–2 on aggregate by winning 3–1 at Camp Nou (with two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo) after a 1–1 draw at the Bernabéu.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2013/2/26/4032842/barcelona-vs-real-madrid-2013-el-clasico-final-score-result-copa-del-rey|title=Barcelona vs. Real Madrid, 2013 El Clasico: Final score 1-3, Los Merengues stunningly brilliant|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|author=Kim McCauley|date=26 February 2013}}</ref> The third win over Barcelona came in the 26th round of La Liga, where Real defeated them 2–1 with goals scored by Karim Benzema and Sergio Ramos.

Mourinho's last year, however, saw infighting between him and several ''galácticos'' like [[Iker Casillas]], Sergio Ramos, [[Pepe (footballer, born 1983)|Pepe]] and Cristiano Ronaldo. Mourinho's selection policy generated controversy; long-time Real Madrid player and club captain Casillas had been sidelined since January 2013 despite recovering from a broken hand, in favor of [[Diego López Rodríguez|Diego López]], who had been in fine form in the domestic and European campaign during Casillas' absence.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.goal.com/en-sg/news/3907/champions-league/2013/04/04/3876985/mourinho-cant-recall-casillas-with-diego-lopez-in-such-fantastic- | title=Mourinho can't call Casillas back with Diego Lopez in such fantastic form &#124; Goal.com}}</ref>

In the Champions League, Real Madrid defeated Manchester United, drawing the first leg at the Bernabeu 1–1 and then producing a comeback 2–1 win at [[Old Trafford]] (which was marred by controversy over a red card being issued to Manchester United player [[Nani (footballer)|Nani]]), with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring in both legs. The team reached their third consecutive Champions League semi-finals, though [[Borussia Dortmund]] beat Real in the first leg 4–1 with [[Robert Lewandowski]] scoring four goals, leading Dortmund manager [[Jürgen Klopp]] to remark that it was a historic night for his club, saying, "That was like Robin Hood taking from the rich" (Dortmund had previously gone with an expensive group of largely foreign players but after almost going bankrupt had restructured back to financial health largely via young home-grown players).<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/25/jose-mourinho-real-madrid-borussia-dortmund | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Sid | last=Lowe | title=Dortmund thrashing of Real like 'Robin Hood taking from the rich', says Klopp | date=25 April 2013}}</ref> Real's 2–0 home win in the second leg with two late goals was not enough to overturn Dortmund's 4–3 aggregate advantage.

Real advanced to the Copa del Rey final against city rival [[Atlético Madrid]] after defeating Barcelona 4–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals. However, Real Madrid fell short of clinching the trophy, being denied by a man-of-the match performance of goalkeeper [[Thibaut Courtois]], as Atletico scored in extra time to win 2–1. Mourinho, despite having signed a four-year contract extension in 2012, departed Real Madrid by mutual agreement with the club at the conclusion of the 2012–13 season, amid feuds with key players Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos and Pepe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1657436-real-madrid-highs-ands-lows-of-their-2013-14-season|title=Real Madrid: Highs and Lows of Their 2012-13 Season|publisher=[[Bleacher Report]]|work=Samuel Marsden|date=31 May 2013}}</ref>

Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures after the season concluded marked the end of the ''Second Galáctico Era'' that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and four FIFA Club World Cup titles.
