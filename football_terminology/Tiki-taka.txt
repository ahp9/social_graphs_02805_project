Earlier tactics that, like tiki-taka, rose to success in their times due to an unprecedented perfection in passing and movement without the ball include the Schalker Kreisel ("Schalke spinning top"), which won [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] six German championships between 1934 and 1942, and the [[Total Football]] used by [[Ajax Amsterdam|Ajax]] and the Dutch national team during the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Die Schalker haben das Tiki-Taka erfunden (Schalke invented the tiki-taka)|language=de|last=Klemm|first=Thomas|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine]]|date=4 October 2014|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/sport/fussball/unser-taeglich-buch-die-schalker-haben-das-tiki-taka-erfunden-13189688.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Heroes or culprits?

Manager [[Angelo Niculescu]] adopted a Temporizare ("delaying") style, which is also considered a precursor of tiki-taka. The team would try to keep possession of the ball for as long as possible, using repeated and short passes until a breach in the opposition defense was found. Using this tactic, he transformed the Romanian national team and managed to qualify them to the Mexico 1970 World Cup after a 32-year absence.<ref>{{Cite web|last=UEFA.com|date=2015-06-20|title=Romania mourns World Cup coach Niculescu {{!}} Inside UEFA|url=https://www.uefa.com/news-media/news/0222-0e911fafd467-7b0d21a6bf9f-1000--romania-mourns-world-cup-coach-niculescu/|access-date=2021-04-04|website=[[UEFA]]|language=en}}</ref>

=== Barcelona ===

The roots of tiki-taka began to be implemented by Johan Cruyff during his tenure as manager of Barcelona from 1988 to 1996.<ref name="martinez" /> The style of play continued to develop under fellow Dutch managers [[Louis van Gaal]] and [[Frank Rijkaard]] and has been adopted by other [[La Liga]] teams.<ref name="martinez">{{cite news

Pep Guardiola managed Barcelona from 2008 to 2012, winning 14 titles. Under his guidance, tiki-taka was established. This was partly due to Guardiola's visionary coaching, partly due to an exceptional generation of players, many of whom had been schooled in La Masia's idiosyncratic style, and partly due to Barcelona's ability to sustain intense pressure on the ball.<ref name="wilson">{{cite news

}}</ref> The tactic shared Dutch Total Football's principle of high defensive line, positional interchange and use of possession to control the game. Tiki-taka diverged from its Total Football roots by subordinating everything to the pass: Guardiola played a [[centre-forward]] as a [[false nine]] to keep the ball moving fluidly from different angles; he played the [[full back (association football)|full-back]]s higher; he selected [[midfielder]]s in defence to exploit their passing ability; and he forced the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] to play the ball out from the back.<ref name="wilson" />

The guiding principle of this type of play was efficient use of space. The teams must narrow the playing space while defending, and must expand the playing space wider while attacking. The objective was to make quick and short passes, till an opponent was caught out of position and space was created. Pep also used the concept of positional play, which in simple words mean that the pitch is divided into different zones, and that no more than two players must occupy the same line vertically and no more than three players should occupy the same line horizontally. Guardiola trained his players by painting lines on the training ground to show players what the zones were. This training made it an instinct of the players to find zones where they can receive or play a pass. Thus, for a layman, it would have look like passing and keeping possession, it was actually quite calculated.

=== Spain national team ===

[[Raphael Honigstein]] describes the tiki-taka played by the [[Spain national football team|Spain national team]] at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] as "a radical style that only evolved over the course of four years," arising from Spain's decision in 2006 that "they weren't physical and tough enough to outmuscle opponents, so instead wanted to concentrate on monopolising the ball."<ref name="honigstein">{{cite news

Pep Guardiola's example of tiki-taka at Barcelona is considered the best application of this style after they won the sextuple in 2009. Barcelona played with a high defensive line usually applying the offside trap with midfielders providing support to defenders to make more passing options available. Defenders are patient, preferring safe pass options looking for midfielders with the ball circulated anywhere on the pitch waiting for a gap to make a vertical pass. The team created most of chances depending on through balls and performing give and go pass usually with [[Lionel Messi]] involved in action. Guardiola preferred freedom in the final third of the pitch which was effective as the team created many chances per match.

Tiki-taka has been variously described as "a style of play based on making your way to the back of the net through short passing and movement,"<ref name="marcotti">{{cite news

[[Sid Lowe]] identifies [[Luis Aragonés]]' tempering of tiki-taka with pragmatism as a key factor in Spain's success in Euro 2008. Aragonés used tiki-taka to "protect a defense that appeared suspect [...], maintain possession and dominate games" without taking the style to "evangelical extremes." None of Spain's first six goals in the tournament came from tiki-taka: five came from direct breaks and one from a set play.<ref name="lowe_2008-06" /> For Lowe, Spain's success in the 2010 World Cup was evidence of the meeting of two traditions in Spain's football: the "powerful, aggressive, direct" style that earned the silver medal-winning [[Football at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Antwerp Olympics]] team the nickname ''La Furia Roja'' ("The Red Fury"), and the tiki-taka style of the contemporary Spain team, which focused on a collective, short-passing, technical and possession-based game.<ref name="lowe_2010-06">{{cite news

Analyzing Spain's [[2010 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Germany vs Spain|semi-final victory over Germany at the 2010 World Cup]], Honigstein described the team's tiki-taka style as "the most difficult version of football possible: an uncompromising passing game, coupled with intense, high pressing." For Honigstein, tiki-taka is "a significant upgrade" of Total Football because it relies on ball movement rather than players switching position. Tiki-taka allowed Spain to "control both the ball and the opponent."<ref name="honigstein" />
<!-- references needed: Both Liverpool and Swansea are using a more aggressive form of tiki-taka where they take advantage of long passes to the flanks more often than Barcelona. Swansea had great success during their 2011-2012 Premier League debut season where they managed a top half finish despite having a weaker team on paper. Liverpool went over to tiki-taka when former Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers took over the team in the 2012–2013 season. After a rocky start to the season the team adapted to the style of play and started dominating games even against top opposition. -->

Hedgecoe claimed, "With no strikers, no defenders…no goalkeeper, perhaps, just 11 technically blessed midfielders merrily passing the ball around until someone walks it into the net".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://iberosphere.com/2012/06/why-i-no-longer-love-spains-tiki-taka/6466|title=Why I no longer love Spain's tiki-taka|publisher=iberosphere.com|date=26 June 2012}}</ref>

In a 2013 interview with ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'', Spain and Barcelona defender [[Gerard Piqué]] admitted that he felt that Barcelona had become predictable in the way they played as a result of being overly dependent on ''tiki-taka'', stating: "We played the last few years with homegrown coaches, first Pep and then Tito, and maybe we ended up exasperating our style of play to the extent that we found ourselves slaves to that system, that style. Now that Tata, who comes from outside the club, has arrived, and who shares the same ideas of football, which are based on possession, he is, however, showing us different options. It's very positive because it gives us variety. When we are being pressed, sending the ball long a few times is not negative; it helps you mix things up, giving you oxygen and preventing us from getting crushed with no way out. We have started pressing far up the field again, winning back possession in the final third of the field and, from there, it's far easier to create chances without having to build up from right at the back, particularly against sides who close up a lot. It's normal to try to develop new ideas and variations. After many years, our opponents obviously knew how we attacked, how we moved. Look at Alves and Alba, for example. They push a lot and some opponents would give them space down the wing, but not let them move inside. It became difficult to get in. We needed to find alternative solutions and Tata's doing that without ruining our style – we still have the same possession. We needed variations like this."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/news/story/_/id/1555339/barcelona-defender-gerard-pique-explains-tiki-taka-slaves-remark |title=Gerard Pique explains tiki-taka remark |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Corrigan |first1=Dermot |date=17 September 2013 |access-date=17 May 2020 }}</ref><ref name="Pique welcomes varied tactics">{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/news/story/_/id/1548815/gerard-pique-welcomes-varied-barcelona-tactics-gerardo-martino |title=Gerard Pique welcomes varied tactics |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Corrigan |first1=Dermot |last2=Gladwell |first2=Ben |date=10 September 2013 |access-date=17 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio_Estero/Liga/10-09-2013/barcellona-pique-ammette-eravamo-schiavi-tiqui-taka-tito-vilanova-tata-martino-201134122055.shtml |title=Barcellona, Piqué ammette: "Eravamo schiavi del tiqui-taca" |work=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=it |last1=Ricci |first1=Filippo Maria |date=10 September 2013 |access-date=17 May 2020 }}</ref>

Although [[Pep Guardiola]] is known for adopting a tiki-taka inspired playing style with his teams, in 2014, he was dismissive of the use of the particular label being applied to describe his teams' playing styles; moreover, he himself was critical of a possession–based strategy with little attacking intent, stating: "I loathe all that passing for the sake of it, all that tiki-taka. It's so much rubbish and has no purpose. You have to pass the ball with a clear intention, with the aim of making it into the opposition's goal. It's not about passing for the sake of it. Don't believe what people say. Barça didn't do tiki-taka! It's completely made up! Don't believe a word of it! In all team sports, the secret is to overload one side of the pitch so that the opponent must tilt its own defence to cope. You overload on one side and draw them in so that they leave the other side weak."<ref name="guardiolatikitaka"/>

In 2017, Italian defender [[Giorgio Chiellini]] expressed his belief that the popularisation of the attacking–minded ''tiki-taka'' playing style, associated with the Spain national side and Barcelona under Guardiola, and the increasing focus on developing defenders who are comfortable with the ball at their feet from a young age, had in fact had a negative impact on their overall defensive quality, and Italian football's ability to produce top defenders in particular, stating: "''Guardiolismo'' [a term he coined for "the Guardiola way"] has ruined a generation of Italian defenders a bit – now everyone is looking to push up, defenders know how to set the tone of play and they can spread the ball, but they don't know how to mark. Unfortunately, that's the way it is. When I was young, we used to do drills to get a feel for the man you were marking. Nowadays, from crosses, Italian defenders – and I can only really talk for Italian defenders, I am only relatively interested about foreign players – don't mark their man. It's a great pity because we're losing our DNA a bit and some of those characteristics which had made us excel in the world. Now, we need talented players up front, but we also need to bring somebody through in defence because we are never going to be able to play Spain's ''tiki-taka'' because it's not part of our philosophy."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.as.com/en/2017/11/09/football/1510250032_810638.html |title=Chiellini: Guardiolismo has ruined a generation of defenders |publisher=AS.com |last1=Calemme |first1=Mirko |date=9 November 2017 |access-date=17 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/italy/story/3264350/pep-guardiolas-tactics-have-ruined-italian-defenders-giorgio-chiellini |title=Pep Guardiola's tactics have 'ruined' Italian defenders - Giorgio Chiellini |publisher=ESPN FC |date=9 November 2017 |access-date=17 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/mondiali-2018/italia/2017/11/09-33618707/italia_chiellini_un_flop_con_la_svezia_sarebbe_unonta/ |title=Italia, l'allarme di Chiellini: "Il guardiolismo ha rovinato una generazione di difensori" |work=Il Corriere dello Sport |language=it |last1=Santoni |first1=Andrea |date=9 November 2017 |access-date=17 May 2020 }}</ref>

Similarly, in 2019, Italian goalkeeper [[Gianluigi Buffon]] expressed mixed views regarding goalkeepers being given more responsibilities with the ball at their feet, as well as the fact that keepers were being increasingly judged by scouts more on their ball skills than their goalkeeping ability, stating: "Today there is this great – in my opinion, exaggerated – focus on how keepers play the ball with their feet; how they need to pass and move with their other team-mates. I myself, ever since I was a kid, was an atypical goalkeeper. I often had this role of being a 'libero', playing with my feet a lot. At times, honestly, I did it in an excessive way. Despite that, I maintain one thing: if you lose that true attention, that sincere focus on being a good goalkeeper – which means stopping shots, knowing how to come out for a high ball, understanding how you approach a low ball as you come off your line – then, for me, you’re being asked to totally go against your natural role." He also added: "You see goalkeepers today who are much better than their peers, but wind up getting overlooked in favour of someone else who can play three tidy passes. If you ask me, I would say that every great team – or at least the teams that have won – has always had a great keeper who knows how to make saves first of all. After that, if they can do things with their feet then sure, that is even better."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/gianluigi-buffon-has-a-few-things-tell-you-about-goalkeeping-and-life |title=Gianluigi Buffon has a few things to tell you about goalkeeping – and life |publisher=FourFourTwo |date=6 March 2019 |access-date=17 May 2020 }}</ref>

== History of countering tiki-taka ==
The high-profile success of tiki-taka as practiced by Barcelona and the Spain national team in the late 2000s led to a variety of tactics and formations designed to contain and counter the system's domination of ball possession.

=== 2008–2009 season ===
Guardiola's Barcelona faced 52 different teams and managed wins against all of them except [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Chelsea required to better perfection to handle Barcelona's backlash|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/23/barcelona-chelsea-champions-league|work=The Guardian |access-date=8 July 2012|author=Daniel Taylor|date=23 April 2012|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Messi's Chelsea jinx continues|url=http://www.mid-day.com/sports/2012/apr/260412-sports-Messis-Chelsea-jinx-continues.htm|work=Mid-Day|publisher=Mid-Day Infomedia Ltd|access-date=8 July 2012|date=26 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Champions League: Barcelona v Chelsea – in pictures|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2012/apr/24/champions-league-barcelona-chelsea-in-pictures#/?picture=389161151&index=1|work=The Guardian |access-date=8 July 2012|author=Steven Bloor|date=24 April 2012|location=London}}</ref> During the [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|2009 Champions League semi-finals]], Chelsea, who were managed by [[Guus Hiddink]], used a solid, compact, and communicating defence to force Barça to shoot outside the penalty area as well as having defender [[José Bosingwa]], helped by centre-back [[John Terry]] and defensive midfielder [[Michael Essien]], man-mark [[Lionel Messi]]. This worked as the first leg was a 0–0 draw at the [[Camp Nou]]. The draw ensured Chelsea were the first visiting team that season to keep a clean sheet in Barça's home stadium. In a controversial second leg match with Chelsea calling for up to four penalties, Chelsea were up 1–0 until [[Andrés Iniesta]] scored in stoppage time to level the tie at 1–1 and let Barça advance on away goals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chelsea ride their luck with 'blue angel' sitting on their goal taunting Barcelona's Lionel Messi|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/9224988/Chelsea-ride-their-luck-with-blue-angel-sitting-on-their-goal-taunting-Barcelonas-Lionel-Messi.html|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|access-date=8 July 2012|author=Jason Burt|date=24 April 2012|location=London}}</ref>

=== 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup ===
The first team to defeat the Spain national team in a tournament during the tiki-taka era was the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], who eliminated Spain with a 2–0 victory in the semi-finals of the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. USA coach [[Bob Bradley]] used a narrow and deep 4–4–2 designed to force Spain's possession to wide areas and draw Spain's defence out of shape, creating space for counter-attacks that resulted in goals for [[Jozy Altidore]] and [[Clint Dempsey]].

=== 2009–2010 season ===
In the [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League knockout phase#Semi-finals|2010 semi-finals of the Champions League]], José Mourinho's [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] players denied Barça space as they double-marked Messi and prevented [[Xavi (footballer, born 1980)|Xavi]] from achieving a successful passing rhythm. Inter won the first leg 3–1, and then lost 0–1 to advance on aggregate 3–2.<ref>{{cite news|title=Inter Milan 3 – 1 Barcelona|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8630297.stm|work=BBC Sport- Football|publisher=BBC|access-date=8 July 2012|author=Jonathan Stevenson|date=20 April 2010}}</ref> Mourinho would become manager of Real Madrid the next season and employ similar tactics, resulting in a bitter domestic rivalry with Guardiola over the following two years.

=== 2010 FIFA World Cup ===

In their opening game of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], Spain suffered a 1–0 loss to [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. Following the match, Switzerland's manager [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]] admitted that he had been influenced by United States coach Bob Bradley's tactics from the Confederations Cup's match between the USA and Spain.<ref>{{cite news|title=Switzerland credits U.S. for its upset of Spain|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/17/AR2010061705667.html|newspaper=Washington Post|access-date=16 April 2015|author=Steven Goff|date=18 June 2010}}</ref>

=== 2011–2012 season ===
Chelsea manager [[Roberto Di Matteo]] succeeded in countering tiki-taka when his team met Barça in the semi-finals of the [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League knockout phase|2011–12 UEFA Champions League]]. According to Chelsea's [[Fernando Torres]], concentrating on space rather than trying to steal the ball was part of his squad's strategy to counter Barça. Winning battles on the wings, such as [[Ramires]] against [[Dani Alves]], would force Barça to funnel their attacks toward the centre of the field. Former Chelsea winger [[Pat Nevin]] noted that stationing three disciplined midfielders in front of the back four defenders denied Barça space, forcing Lionel Messi to withdraw deeper and narrower to get to the ball (as Messi was high on the pitch, he was stripped of the ball by Chelsea's [[Frank Lampard]], which led to a goal for Chelsea in the first leg).<ref>{{cite web|title=Chelsea can prey on Barcelona's weaknesses|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thefootballtacticsblog/2012/04/can_chelsea_prey_on_barcelonas.html|work=BBC Football Tactics Blog|publisher=BBC|access-date=8 July 2012|author=Alistair Magowan|date=23 April 2012}}</ref> During the second leg, Di Matteo deployed a 4–5–1 formation with a very compact midfield structure. While Barça enjoyed 73% of ball possession over the two legs and 46 shots to Chelsea's 12 (11 of these shots on target versus Chelsea's four), by contrast, Chelsea's Frank Lampard completed two telling passes in the two legs; both of them leading to goals.

=== 2012–2013 season ===
The [[2012–13 FC Barcelona season|next season]], Barcelona faced [[Massimiliano Allegri]]'s [[A.C. Milan]] in the Champions League round of 16. In the first leg at the San Siro, Milan employed a very narrow 4–4–2 formation, with [[Stephan El Shaarawy]] acting both as a second striker and a fifth midfielder, ready to break in behind Dani Alves, and [[Sulley Muntari]] closely man-marking Xavi in the center. Thus, Barcelona had only one chance on goal and ended up losing 2–0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zonalmarking.net/2013/02/22/milan-2-0-barcelona-barca-completely-nullified/|title=Milan 2-0 Barcelona: Barca completely nullified|website=Zonal Marking}}</ref> In the second leg, Barca changed their formation to what was effectively a 3–3–1–3, with David Villa in a centre-forward role, allowing Messi space between the lines and completely demolishing Milan's shape, ending in a 4–0 Barcelona victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zonalmarking.net/2013/03/13/barcelona-4-0-milan-tactics/|title=Barcelona 4-0 Milan: Villa plays centrally and allows Messi space between the lines|website=Zonal Marking}}</ref>

Later in the same season, tiki-taka's vulnerability was exposed when [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] defeated Barça 4–0 in the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League|2012–13 Champions League]] semi-finals and 3–0 in the return leg. Bayern head coach [[Jupp Heynckes]] had built upon his predecessor [[Louis van Gaal]]'s foundations by making the team more defensively balanced, while replacing Van Gaal's "positional football"—everyone had to stick to their specific space on the pitch when attacking the opposition goal—with a much more fluid and attacking style that gave the forwards freedom to roam and swap.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22253591|title=Bayern Munich: Is this their best ever team?|work=BBC Sport|access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref> In the first leg, Barça enjoyed 63% possession but Bayern had 11 corners to Barcelona's four, and had nine shots on goal to Barça's one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/sports/soccer/Barcelona+shouldn+give+hope+turning+around+deficit+Bayern/8288182/story.html|title=canada.com - Page Not Found|via=Canada.com}}</ref> Bayern's [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] and [[Javi Martínez]] held a compact midfield that played crucial roles in shutting down Barcelona's [[Xavi (footballer, born 1980)|Xavi]]'s and [[Andrés Iniesta]]'s attempts to pass forward at midfield, while [[Arjen Robben]] and [[Franck Ribéry]] proved effective on the wings.<ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/23/javi-martinez-bayern-barcelona | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Michael | last=Cox | title=Javi Martínez the key weapon as Bayern cut Barcelona down to size | date=23 April 2013}}</ref><ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22254778|title=Bayern Munich 4-0 Barcelona|work=BBC Sport|access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref>

=== 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup ===
Tiki-taka was again exposed when [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] defeated Spain 3–0 in the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup|2013 Confederations Cup]] [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup Final|final]], ending Spain's run of 29 unbeaten matches in competitive football.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/confederationscup/matches/round=255211/match=300222461/summary.html |title=Fred and Neymar claim Confeds for Brazil |publisher=FIFA.com |date=July 1, 2013 |access-date=July 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702190636/http://www.fifa.com/confederationscup/matches/round%3D255211/match%3D300222461/summary.html |archive-date=July 2, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/brazil-defeats-spain-to-win-confederations-cup-1.1313782|title=Brazil defeats Spain to win Confederations Cup|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|date=June 30, 2013|access-date=July 1, 2013}}</ref> The ball possession was 47% for Brazil and 53% for Spain, with two goals conceded in the first half of the match.

=== 2013–2014 season ===
[[Diego Simeone]]'s [[Atlético Madrid]] faced Barcelona six times in the [[2013–14 in Spanish football|2013–14 season]], managing to remain undefeated in all six matches. Simeone utilized a 4–4–1–1 formation, with [[Gabi (footballer, born 1983)|Gabi]] and [[Tiago Mendes|Tiago]] as the defensive midfielders, [[Koke (footballer, born 1992)|Koke]] and [[Arda Turan]] acting more like inside-midfielders than traditional wingers, [[Raúl García (footballer, born 1986)|Raul García]] or [[David Villa]] often dropping deep to join the midfield and [[Diego Costa]] as the lone striker up-front. In this formation, Simeone denied Barcelona their vital space in the midfield, rendering tiki-taka tactics useless against Atlético. Atlético also relied on their height advantage over the Barça players, with centre-backs [[Diego Godín]] and [[Miranda (footballer, born 1984)|Miranda]] intercepting all Barcelona long-balls and often going forward when Atlético took a corner kick or free-kick. It is no coincidence that Godín scored Atlético's goal in the last league match against Barcelona, a header from a corner-kick, to give Simeone's team the league title. Atlético also managed to eliminate Barcelona from the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] relying on these tactics.

[[Carlo Ancelotti]]'s [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] relied on positioning to force [[Pep Guardiola]]'s Bayern Munich to defeat in the first semi-final leg of the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League]] at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Santiago Bernabéu]]. Bayern, practicing a form of tiki-taka, pressed high in attack but was vulnerable in defence. Real Madrid's players strictly kept their positions when defending, and managed to score on a counter-attack, winning the first game 1–0. In the second leg in [[Munich]], Bayern's defences were even more vulnerable, and Real Madrid managed a resounding 4–0 victory, their first ever away victory against Bayern, eliminating the Champions League holders.

=== 2014 FIFA World Cup ===
In the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]], Dutch manager Louis van Gaal deployed a 5–3–2 formation against Spain in the first match of the group stage. This formation had [[Robin van Persie]] and [[Arjen Robben]] as strikers, [[Midfielder|a three-man midfield]] assisted by wing-backs [[Daryl Janmaat]] and [[Daley Blind]] and a three-man defence. Spain managed to open the score from a controversial penalty won by Diego Costa and converted by [[Xabi Alonso]], but the swift counter-attacks of the Netherlands proved highly effective in the rest of the match, resulting in a 5–1 victory for the Dutch, topped off by Robin van Persie's "flying dutchman" masterpiece, the worst defeat for Spain in 64 years. It is noteworthy that Van Gaal was the manager of Barcelona in the 2002–03 season, the man mainly responsible for bringing up Xavi and Andrés Iniesta, who went on to become basic elements of Barcelona and Spain's tiki-taka style.

In the second match of the group stage, [[Chile national football team|Chile]] under [[Jorge Sampaoli]] used a fluidly-changing 3–4–3 formation, evolving into a 5–3–2 when defending, and having their three central midfielders man-mark Spain's three central midfielders ([[Marcelo Díaz]] on [[David Silva]], [[Charles Aránguiz]] on Xabi Alonso and [[Arturo Vidal]] on [[Sergio Busquets]]), a tactic previously used by influential coach [[Marcelo Bielsa]]. Chile managed to score twice in the first half, and Spain were unable to breach their opponents five-man defence, exiting the World Cup in the group stage. Spain's disastrous 2014 World Cup, along with Barcelona's move to a more direct style under managers [[Gerardo Martino]] and [[Luis Enrique (footballer)|Luis Enrique]], have marked the end of tiki-taka.<ref name="Five reasons Barcelona might struggle"/><ref name="Is Luis Enrique a Better Barcelona Manager Than Pep"/><ref name="evolution of Barcelona's Tiki Taka"/><ref name="Pique welcomes varied tactics"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/world-cup-2014-spains-humiliating-exit-signals-the-painful-death-of-tikitaka-as-we-know-it-9548602.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220507/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/world-cup-2014-spains-humiliating-exit-signals-the-painful-death-of-tikitaka-as-we-know-it-9548602.html |archive-date=2022-05-07 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Spain World Cup 2014: Spain's humiliating exit signals the painful death of tiki-taka as we know it|publisher=Independent.co.uk|date=June 19, 2014|access-date=August 28, 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fusion.net/story/108346/end-of-tiki-taka|title=Sunday's Clásico marked the definitive end of tiki taka|work=Fusion |publisher=Fusion.net|date=23 March 2015|access-date=28 August 2015}}</ref>

=== UEFA Euro 2016 ===
Following a successful qualifying campaign, a rejuvenated Spain entered [[UEFA Euro 2016]] with a majority of the team's golden generation still intact, along with a new wave of attacking players such as [[Nolito]] and [[Álvaro Morata]] leading the line. ''La Roja'''s opening two group games against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] both resulted in convincing 1–0 and 3–0 wins respectively. With the new generation of attacking talent combining with the tiki-taka style of play of the remaining players from the golden generation, Spain quickly became unanimous favourites for the tournament by the media, and with two wins from their first two group games, Spain look set to win their group, giving them the luxury of not having to play a group winner until the semi-final round going into their final group game against second-placed [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/european-championship/74/blog/post/2897602/spain-have-been-the-best-of-the-euro-2016-contenders-so-far|title=Spain seem to be Euro 2016 favourites as contenders struggle for form|publisher=ESPN FC|date=June 19, 2016|access-date=June 28, 2016}}</ref> Thanks to the Croatians' effective exploitation of Spain's vulnerability to the counter-attack, Spain lost their final group game 2–1, despite having taken an early lead through [[Álvaro Morata|Alvaro Morata]], which was canceled out by a goal later in the half from [[Nikola Kalinić (footballer)|Nikola Kalinić]], followed by a last-gasp winner from [[Ivan Perišić]]. As a result, Spain finished runners-up in their group behind Croatia, setting them up for a rematch of their Euro 2012 final with [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. Despite being the favourites, Spain were caught off guard by Italy's uncharacteristically aggressive attacking play in the first half, as Italy took the lead just after the half-hour mark, with [[Giorgio Chiellini]] putting away a rebound from an Italian free-kick. Spain began to regain more ball possession and began to push for an equalizer in the second half, but the Italians' strong defense repeatedly repelled Spain's attack. Spain also lacked enough space in the midfield to create any decent chances due to Italian coach [[Antonio Conte]]'s usage of a 3–5–2 formation, with Italy's superior numbers in the midfield allowing Italy to create multiple scoring opportunities on the counter-attack that was previously exploited by Croatia. Italy ultimately scored another goal in added time through [[Graziano Pellè]], securing the win for Italy.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Foulerton |title=Dominant Italy brush aside champions Spain |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/history/news/0253-0d81b24e0059-7534c6d3e771-1000--dominant-italy-brush-aside-holders-spain-in-euro-2016-first/ |website=[[UEFA]] |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=27 June 2016 |access-date=27 June 2016 }}</ref>
