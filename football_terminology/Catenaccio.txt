[[File:Catenaccio1.png|thumb|Karl Rappan's ''verrou'', a predecessor to the ''catenaccio'']]

'''''Catenaccio''''' ({{IPA|it|kateˈnattʃo}}) or '''The Chain''' is a [[Association football tactics and skills|tactical system]] in [[association football|football]] with a strong emphasis on defence. In [[Italian language|Italian]], ''catenaccio'' means "door-bolt", which implies a highly organised and effective backline defence focused on nullifying opponents' attacks and preventing goal-scoring opportunities.

==History==
===Predecessors and influences===
Italian ''catenaccio'' was influenced by the ''verrou'' (also ''doorbolt'' or ''chain'' in French) system invented by [[Austria]]n coach [[Karl Rappan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mogiel.net/EC/intertoto-history/background.php |title=Background on the Intertoto Cup |last=Elbech |first=Søren Florin |publisher=Mogiel.net (Pawel Mogielnicki) |access-date=14 May 2012}}</ref> As coach of [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in the 1930s and 1940s, Rappan played a defensive [[Defender (association football)|sweeper]] called the ''verrouilleur'' (literally "the one who locks the door"), positioned just ahead of the goalkeeper.<ref>Andy Gray with Jim Drewett. Flat Back Four: The Tactical Game. Macmillan Publishers Ltd, London, 1998.</ref> Rappan's ''verrou'' system, proposed in 1932, when he was coach of [[Servette FC|Servette]], was essentially a modification of the 2–3–5 system, and in some ways resembled the modern 4–4–2 or [[Formation (association football)#4–3–3|4–3–3 formations]]; his system implemented with four defenders, three of which were fielded in a fixed role playing a strict [[man-to-man marking]] system, plus an attacking [[Midfielder#Centre-half|centre-half]], who would also act as a [[playmaker]], in the middle of the field, who played the ball together with two [[Midfielder#Winger|midfield wings]]. The system was essentially a 1–3–3–3 formation, with the ''verrouilleur'' as the last player in front of the goalkeeper, and with the two outside forwards or wingers functioning as forwards high up the pitch, keeping possession of the ball and always looking to cross the ball to the central striker making runs into the box or looking to find a pass to the most forward midfielder making a run in behind the opposing defense from the midfield. (with the right winger sitting slightly further back), but who would often drop off into deeper midfield roles when possession was lost. The team would often sit back and defend during matches, which enabled them to overcome stronger teams or physically fitter opponents successfully. In his 2009 book ''Inverting the Pyramid'', [[Jonathan Wilson (writer)|Jonathan Wilson]] notes that the "''verrou'' ... is best understood as a development from the old 2–3–5 ... . Rather than the centre-half dropping in between the two [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-backs]], as in the W-M, the two wing-halves fell back to flank them. They retained an attacking role, but their primary function was to combat the opposition wingers. The two full-backs then became in effect central defenders, playing initially almost alongside each other, although in practice, if the opposition attacked down their right, the left of the two would move towards the ball, with the right covering just behind, and vice versa. In theory, that always left them with a spare man–the ''verrouilleur'' as the Swiss press of the time called him or the ''libro'' as he would become–at the back." Wilson notes that a weakness of the ''verrou'' system was that it placed excessive demands on the centre-half, as the player deployed in this role was required to attack and act as a playmaker when on the ball, while instead dropping back into the defence, acting almost as a centre-back, off the ball. With this system, Rappan won two league titles with Servette, and five more with [[Grasshopper Club Zürich|Grasshopper]], after joining the club in 1935.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/787166-world-football-the-five-greatest-tactical-innovations-in-football-history |title=World Football: The 5 Greatest Tactical Innovations in Football History |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=Sahu |first1=Amogha |date=2 August 2011 |access-date=25 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thefalse9.com/2015/01/football-tactics-beginnerscatenaccio.html |title=Football Tactics For Beginners: Catenaccio |publisher=thefalse9.com |last1=Chatterjee |first1=Jayeek |date=9 January 2015 |access-date=25 May 2020 }}</ref><ref name="pyramid">{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Jonathan |title=Inverting The Pyramid: The History of Soccer Tactics |date=2009 |publisher=Orion |location=London |isbn=978-1-56858-963-3 |pages=159–66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0dXDwAAQBAJ&q=rappan+four+defenders+verrou&pg=PA160 |access-date=25 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jun/08/euro2008 |title=The end of forward thinking |work=The Guardian |last1=Wilson |first1=Jonathan |date=8 June 2008 |access-date=25 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Jay |title=The Best of Soccer Journal: An NSCAA Guide to Soccer Coaching Excellence |date=2012 |publisher=Maidenhead: Meyer & Meyer Sport |location=London |isbn=978-1-84126-329-8 |pages=69–71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kgW6UtpiofoC&q=%22karl+rappan%22+playmaker&pg=PA70 |access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref>

During his time with Soviet club [[PFC Krylia Sovetov Samara|Krylya Sovetov Kuybyshev]] in the 1940s, Alexander Kuzmich Abramov also used a similar defensive tactic known as the ''Volzhskaya Zashchepka'', or the "Volga Clip." Unlike the ''verrou'', his system was not as flexible, and was a development of the 3–2–5 or ''[[Formation (association football)#WM|WM]]'', rather than the 2–3–5, but it also featured one of the half-backs dropping deep; this allowed the defensive centre-half to sweep in behind the full-backs, essentially acting as a sweeper.<ref name="pyramid"/> In [[Spain]], starting in the 1940s and reaching great success in the 1950s, [[Helenio Herrera]] developed an early version of his 1960s ''catenaccio.'' With [[Atlético Madrid]] (1949–1953), he won two consecutive league titles with a defence nicknamed "the Iron Curtain". He kept on developing his system later on in other Spanish clubs until reaching his well-known 5–3–2 formation when he went years later to [[Inter Milan|Inter]] in [[Italy]] (see below).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.martiperarnau.com/alfonso-aparicio-santo-y-sena-del-atletico-de-madrid/|title=Alfonso Aparicio: santo y seña del Atlético de Madrid|website=martiperarnau.com|language=es|access-date=1 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://soycalcio.com/2020/04/14/vida-y-obra-del-catenaccio-iii-helenio-herrera/|title=Vida y obra del catenaccio (III) La historia de Helenio Herrera|website=Soy Calcio|language=es|last=Fernando Nogueras|date=14 April 2020|access-date=1 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://footballcitizens.com/helenio-herrera/|title=Helenio Herrera.

Italian ''Catenaccio'' has its roots with [[Mario Villini]] of [[Triestina Calcio|Triestina]] in the 1941 season,<ref name=":0">''Grandi storie. L'allenatore. Pp. 2''.

Although this ultra-defensive strategy was initially criticised by members of the Italian press, including journalist [[Gianni Brera]], Andrea Schianchi of ''La Gazzetta dello Sport'' notes that this modification was designed to help smaller teams in Italy, as the man–to–man system often put players directly against one another, favouring the larger and wealthier teams with stronger individual players.<ref name="pyramid" /><ref name="Nereo Rocco, l'inventore del catenaccio che diventò Paròn d'Europa">{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/02-11-2014/nereo-rocco-inventore-catenaccio-che-divento-paron-d-europa-milan-90920157724.shtml|title=Nereo Rocco, l'inventore del catenaccio che diventò Paròn d'Europa|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=it|author1=Andrea Schianchi|date=2 November 2014|access-date=5 November 2015}}</ref><ref name="Storie di schemi: l'evoluzione della tattica" /><ref name="storiedicalcio.altervista.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/rocco.html|title=Nereo Rocco|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=it|access-date=5 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://contropiede.ilgiornale.it/gipo-viani-linventore-del-vianema-che-amava-il-vizio-e-scopri-rivera/ |title=Gipo Viani, l'inventore del "Vianema" che amava il vizio e scoprì Rivera |work=Il Giornale |language=it |last1=Damiani |first1=Lorenzo |access-date=19 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mondopallone.it/2013/04/08/piccola-storia-della-tattica-la-nascita-del-catenaccio-il-vianema-e-nereo-rocco-linter-di-foni-e-di-herrera-iv-parte/ |title=Piccola Storia della Tattica: la nascita del catenaccio, il Vianema e Nereo Rocco, l'Inter di Foni e di Herrera (IV parte) |publisher=mondopallone.it |language=it |last1=Chichierchia |first1=Paolo |date=8 April 2013 |access-date=19 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820024914/http://www.mondopallone.it/2013/04/08/piccola-storia-della-tattica-la-nascita-del-catenaccio-il-vianema-e-nereo-rocco-linter-di-foni-e-di-herrera-iv-parte/ |archive-date=20 August 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://invasoredicampo.blogspot.com/2011/01/lavagna-tattica-che-vinca-il-migliore.html |title=LAVAGNA TATTICA, il catenaccio all'italiana |publisher=Invasore di Campo |language=it |last1=Brigante |first1=Giuseppe |access-date=19 May 2020 }}</ref>

In the 1946 season, [[Ottavio Barbieri]] introduced the sweeper role to Italian football during his time as [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]]'s manager. He was influenced by Rappan's ''verrou'', and made several alterations to the English WM system or ''sistema'', which led to his system being described as ''mezzosistema''. [[Gipo Viani]], after him, called this "Vianema". His system used a man-marking back-line, with three man-marking defenders and a full-back who was described as a ''terzino volante'' (or ''vagante'', as noted at the time by former footballer and ''[[Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' journalist [[Renzo De Vecchi]]); the latter position was essentially a ''libero''. The team's midfield played in a triangular shape, with the centre-half-back or ''metodista'' fielded in front of the back-line. His formation also made use of three forwards in attacking trident, but the right-sided [[Forward (association football)#Winger|winger]] was also tasked with assisting the midfield defensively, and therefore acted in the manner of a right-sided [[Midfielder#Wide midfielder|wide midfielder]], known as the ''tornante'' in Italian football.<ref name="Storie di schemi: l'evoluzione della tattica" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/genoa-top-11-all-time.html |title=Genoa: Top 11 All Time |date=9 August 2017 |publisher=Storie di Calcio |language=it |access-date=21 May 2020 }}</ref>

===Italian ''catenaccio''===
In the late 1950s, [[Nereo Rocco]]'s [[Calcio Padova|Padova]] pioneered a modified catenaccio tactics in Italy where it would be used again by other Italian teams throughout the 1960s; his strategy was initially also known as the ''mezzosistema'', as, like the ''vianema'', it modified elements of the ''sistema''.<ref name="Storie di schemi: l'evoluzione della tattica"/><ref>cbcsports.com [http://www.cbc.ca/sports/worldcup2006/history/events/1962.html 1962 Chile]</ref><ref>fifa.com [https://web.archive.org/web/20070701212342/http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/matchreport/newsid=512172.html Intercontinental Cup 1969]</ref> Rocco's tactic, often referred to as the real ''Catenaccio'', was shown first in 1947 with [[U.S. Triestina|Triestina]]: the most common mode of operation was a 1–3–3–3 formation with a strictly defensive team approach, while his team would look to score by starting quick counter-attacks with long balls after winning back possession. With catenaccio, Triestina finished the Serie A tournament in a surprising second place. Some variations include 1–4–4–1 and 1–4–3–2 [[Formation (association football)|formations]]. He later had great success with [[AC Milan|Milan]] using the catenaccio system during the 60s and 1970s, winning several titles, including two [[Serie A]] titles, three [[Coppa Italia]] titles, two [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]], two [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cups]], and an [[Intercontinental Cup (1960–2004)|Intercontinental Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/what-nereo-rocco-would-say-about-ac-milan-and-the-azzurri-88731 |title=What Nereo Rocco would say about AC Milan and the Azzurri |publisher=Calciomercato |date=21 November 2017 |access-date=24 February 2020 }}</ref><ref name="Pianeta Milan">{{cite web |url=https://www.pianetamilan.it/focus/news-milan-el-paron-nereo-rocco-lallenatore-della-prima-coppa-campioni/ |title=El Paròn Nereo Rocco, l'allenatore della prima Coppa Campioni |publisher=Pianeta Milan |language=it |date=20 May 2019 |access-date=24 February 2020 |archive-date=24 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200224175816/https://www.pianetamilan.it/focus/news-milan-el-paron-nereo-rocco-lallenatore-della-prima-coppa-campioni/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="La storia della tattica: dal Catenaccio al calcio totale">{{cite web |url=https://www.eurosport.it/calcio/la-storia-della-tattica-dal-catenaccio-al-calcio-totale_sto4735856/story.shtml |title=La storia della tattica: dal Catenaccio al calcio totale |publisher=Eurosport |language=it |last1=Fontana |first1=Mattia |date=12 August 2014 |access-date=19 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/padova_rocco.html |title=Il Padova di Nereo Rocco: La Leggenda del Santo Catenaccio |date=26 November 2015 |publisher=Storie di Calcio |language=it |access-date=25 May 2020 }}</ref>

[[Alfredo Foni]] used the ''catenaccio'' tactic successfully with Inter during the early 1950s; unlike Rocco, the teams's strong defensive play off the ball did not limit the offensive manner in which his team played while in possession of the ball.<ref name="Storie di schemi: l'evoluzione della tattica">{{cite web |url=https://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/storie-di-schemi.html |title=Storie di schemi: l'evoluzione della tattica |date=24 December 2015 |publisher=Storie di Calcio |language=it |access-date=19 May 2020 }}</ref> In his system, his team's right winger, [[Gino Armano]], would drop back to mark the opposing team's left winger (essentially acting as a ''tornante''), allowing [[Ivano Blason]], the right-back, to shift across and act as a sweeper and clear balls away. Blason also played as a sweeper under Rocco; as such, he is often considered to be the first true sweeper in Italian football.<ref name="pyramid"/><ref name="Nereo Rocco, l'inventore del catenaccio che diventò Paròn d'Europa"/> The key innovation of ''Catenaccio'' was the introduction of the role of a ''libero'' defender (sweeper) who was positioned behind a line of three defenders. The sweeper's role was to recover loose balls, nullify the opponent's striker and double-mark when necessary. Another important innovation was the counter-attack, mainly based on long passes from the defence.<ref name="Storie di schemi: l'evoluzione della tattica" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimouomo.com/catenaccio-storia-origini/ |title=Breve storia del catenaccio |publisher=Ultimo Uomo |language=it |last1=Aquè |first1=Federico |date=25 March 2020 |access-date=19 May 2020 }}</ref>

In [[Helenio Herrera]]'s version of ''catenaccio'' in the 1960s, he used a 5–3–2 formation, in which four man-marking defenders were tightly assigned to the opposing attackers while an extra player, the sweeper, would pick up any loose ball that escaped the coverage of the defenders. The emphasis of this system in Italian football spawned the rise of many top Italian defenders who became known for their hard-tackling and ruthless defending. Despite the defensive connotations, Herrera claimed shortly before his death that the system was more attacking than people remembered, saying "the problem is that most of the people who copied me copied me wrongly. They forgot to include the attacking principles that my Catenaccio included. I had [[Armando Picchi|Picchi]] as a sweeper, yes, but I also had [[Giacinto Facchetti|Facchetti]], the first full back to score as many goals as a forward." Although his ''[[Grande Inter]]'' side were known primarily for their defensive strength, they were equally renowned for their ability to score goals with few touches from fast, sudden [[counter-attacks]], due to Herrera's innovative use of attacking, overlapping full-backs. Under Herrera, Inter enjoyed a highly successful spell, which saw them win three Serie A titles, two European Cups, and two Intercontinental Cups.<ref name="Helenio Herrera: More than just catenaccio">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=61622/profile.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116143638/http://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=61622/profile.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 January 2017|title=Helenio Herrera: More than just catenaccio|publisher=FIFA|access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/707/431/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222165048/http://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/707/431/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 February 2014|title=Mazzola: Inter is my second family|publisher=FIFA|access-date=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref name="leggenda">{{cite web|url=http://www.inter.it/it/societa/storia2005-2.html |title=La leggenda della Grande Inter|trans-title=The legend of the Grande Inter|publisher=Inter.it|language=it|access-date=10 September 2014 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019213304/http://www.inter.it/it/societa/storia2005-2.html|archive-date=19 October 2012}}</ref><ref name="sempreinter">{{cite web|url=http://www.sempreinter.com/2012/10/15/la-grande-inter-helenio-herrera-1910-1997-il-mago/|title=La Grande Inter: Helenio Herrera (1910-1997) – "Il Mago"|date=15 October 2012 |publisher=Sempre Inter|language=it|access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1606149-great-team-tactics-breaking-down-helenio-herreras-la-grande-inter|title=Great Team Tactics: Breaking Down Helenio Herrera's 'La Grande Inter'|publisher=Bleacher Report|access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref><ref name="Obituary">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obitaury-helenio-herrera-1293412.html |title=Obituary: Helenio Herrera – Obituaries, News |work=The Independent |location=UK |first=Norman |last=Fox |date= 11 November 1997|access-date=22 April 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2019/08/07/helenio-herrera-innovator-who-single-handedly-changed-beautiful-game |title=Helenio Herrera: The Innovator Who Single-Handedly Changed the Beautiful Game |magazine=Sports Illustrated |date=7 August 2019 |access-date=22 May 2020 }}</ref><ref name="Profilo: Helenio Herrera">{{cite web |url=https://it.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0231-0e94dc2f87d8-92b9107d1dd6-1000--profilo-helenio-herrera/ |title=Profilo: Helenio Herrera |publisher=UEFA |language=it |date=4 September 2016 |access-date=22 May 2020 }}</ref>

Manager [[Ferruccio Valcareggi]] used tactics inspired by the Italian ''catenaccio'' system, which was popularised by Inter manager Herrera during the 1960s, with the Italy national team, employing a sweeper behind two man–marking central defenders and a full-back, as well as a strategy which made use of heavy defending, focussing predominantly on stability, grinding out results while conceding few goals and defending narrow leads; although his tactics were controversial – in particular as during the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] in Mexico, he devised his infamous ''staffetta'' (relay) policy of playing one of his two star playmakers, [[Sandro Mazzola]] and [[Gianni Rivera]], in each half, to avoid offsetting the defensive balance within his team – and not particularly exciting, they proved to be effective. Moreover, although at times he drew criticism in the Italian media over Italy's dull, slow gameplay and lack of goals, Italy also demonstrated their offensive capabilities throughout the tournament, as well as their technical capabilities, which enabled them to conserve energy and cope with the altitude in Mexico. He had a successful spell as Italy's manager, winning [[UEFA Euro 1968]] on home soil, and leading Italy to the [[1970 FIFA World Cup Final|1970 World Cup final]]; however, in the latter match, Italy suffered a heavy 4–1 defeat to a much more [[Jogo Bonito|offensive minded and stylish]] Brazilian side. His team adopted a more attractive playing style in the lead-up to the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]], which saw them considered among the favourites to win, but suffered a surprising first-round elimination in the final tournament.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/oct/25/world-cup-final-1970-brazil-v-italy-as-it-happened |title=World Cup final 1970: Brazil v Italy – as it happened |work=The Guardian |last1=Smyth |first1=Rob |last2=Murray |first2=Scott |date=25 October 2016 |access-date=20 May 2020 }}</ref><ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite web|author1=Brian Glanville|title=Obituary: Ferruccio Valcareggi|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/05/italy.football|work=The Guardian|access-date=2 April 2015|date=5 November 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/1970-world-cup-pele-takes-his-final-bow-1.804446 |title=1970 World Cup: Pele takes his final bow |publisher=CBC Sports |last1=Molinaro |first1=John F. |date=21 November 2009 |access-date=20 May 2020 }}</ref><ref name="storiedicalcio.2">{{cite web |url=https://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/valcareggi_ferruccio.html |title=VALCAREGGI Ferruccio: una vita nel pallone |date=9 February 2016 |publisher=storiedicalcio.altervista.org |language=it |access-date=20 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/great-sporting-moments-brazil-4-italy-1-1970-world-cup-final-1741232.html |title=Great Sporting Moments: Brazil 4 Italy 1, 1970 World Cup final |work=The Independent |last1=Viner |first1=Brian |date=13 July 2009 |access-date=20 May 2020 }}</ref><ref name="magliarossonera">{{cite web |url=http://www.magliarossonera.it/protagonisti/Gioc-Valcareggi.html |title=Ferruccio VALCAREGGI (I) |publisher=magliarossonera.it |language=it |access-date=20 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2005/11/03/esce-mazzola-entra-rivera-cosi-la-staffetta.html |title=Esce Mazzola, entra Rivera così la staffetta ha fatto storia |work=La Repubblica |language=it |last1=CROSETTI |first1=MAURIZIO |date=3 November 2005 |access-date=20 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1986/05/30/vigilia-mundial-pensando-al-70.html |title=VIGILIA MUNDIAL PENSANDO AL ' 70 |work=La Repubblica |language=it |last1=BRERA |first1=GIANNI |date=30 May 1986 |access-date=20 May 2020 }}</ref><ref name="LA STORIA DEL CALCIO">{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/calcio-la-storia-del-calcio_%28Enciclopedia-dello-Sport%29/ |title=CALCIO - LA STORIA DEL CALCIO |publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport |language=it |access-date=20 May 2020 }}</ref>

===Decline of ''catenaccio'' with the advent of ''total football'', and the birth of ''zona mista''===
[[Jock Stein]]'s [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] defeated the ''catenaccio'' system in the [[1967 European Cup Final]] with a highly offensive strategy. They beat Herrera's Inter Milan 2–1 on 25 May 1967 creating the blue print for [[Rinus Michels]]' ''total football'', a continuation of Stein's free flowing attacking football.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1967/may/25/championsleague.sport |title=Relentless attack captures European Cup |work=The Guardian |date=25 May 1967 |access-date=28 November 2011 |location=London |first=Albert |last=Barham }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/scottish-premier/3005452/Murdoch-the-true-Lionheart.html |title=Murdoch the true Lionheart |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=15 May 2001 |access-date=7 April 2012 |location=London |first=Roddy |last=Forsyth }}</ref><ref name="Chris Hunt">{{cite news |url=http://www.chrishunt.biz/features40.html |title=LOCAL HEROES: THE LISBON LIONS |publisher=Chris Hunt |date=June 2007 |access-date=13 November 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0045/print.shtml |title=Celtic win European Cup 1967 |work=BBC Sport |access-date=21 May 2020 }}</ref> ''[[Total Football]]'', which was invented by Dutch manager Rinus Michels in the 1970s, exposed the weaknesses of the ''Catenaccio'' system. Unlike previous systems, in ''Total Football'', no out–field player is fixed in their nominal role; anyone can assume in the field the duties of an [[attacker]], a [[midfielder]] or a [[Defender (association football)|defender]], depending on the play. Due to players often switching positions with one another, man-marking strategies, such as ''catenaccio'', were no longer effective at coping with this fluid system.<ref name="Storie di schemi: l'evoluzione della tattica" /><ref name="tactical fads" /><ref name="What is Total Football?" /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/dec/23/the-question-football-tactics-develop-decade |title=The Question: How will football tactics develop over the next decade? |work=The Guardian |last1=Wilson |first1=Jonathan |date=23 December 2009 |access-date=21 May 2020 }}</ref> Despite previously losing out 4–1 to Milan in the [[1969 European Cup Final]], who were managed by Rocco, a manager known for his defensive catenaccio strategy,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/match/62526--milan-vs-ajax/?referrer=%2Fuefachampionsleague%2Fseason%3D1968%2Fmatches%2Fround%3D960%2Fmatch%3D62526%2Findex |title=Milan 4–1 Ajax |publisher=UEFA |access-date=21 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.gazzetta.it/Dream_Cup/Primo_Piano/2007/07_Luglio/Milan_69.shtml |title=Il mondo ai piedi del Milan di Rocco |work=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=it |access-date=21 May 2020 }}</ref> in 1972, Michels' [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] defeated Inter 2–0 in the [[1972 European Cup Final|European Cup final]], and Dutch newspapers announced the "destruction of ''Catenaccio''" at the hands of ''Total Football''.<ref name="tactical fads">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/12019180/From-2-3-5-to-gegenpress-how-footballs-tactical-fads-have-come-and-gone.html |title=From 2-3-5 to gegenpress: how football's tactical fads have come and gone |work=The Daily Telegraph |last1=Liew |first1=Jonathan |date=27 November 2015 |access-date=21 May 2020 }}</ref><ref name="What is Total Football?">{{cite web |url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/what-is-total-football-famous-tactics-explained-the-clubs/w5yd5dzofn4p17ewmav4atk2b |title=What is Total Football?

As man-marking alone was insufficient to cope with the fluidity of ''total football'', coaches consequently began to create a new tactical system that mixed man-marking with zonal defence in order to counter this strategy, which came to be known as ''[[zona mista]]'' ("mixed zone" in Italian), or ''gioco all'italiana'' ("gameplay in the Italian manner" in Italian), in Italian football, as it mixed elements of Italian ''catenaccio'' ([[Marking (association football)#Man-to-man marking|man-marking]]) with elements of ''total football'' ([[Marking (association football)#Zonal marking|zonal marking]]). Italian manager [[Giovanni Trapattoni]], who had played under Rocco at Milan, and was initially influenced by Rocco's ''catenaccio'' system, was one of the main proponents of this system from the 1970s onwards, and used it to great success.<ref name="Storie di schemi: l'evoluzione della tattica" /><ref name="tactical fads" /><ref name="What is Total Football?" />

==Modern use of ''catenaccio''==
===Derivative defensive strategies===
Highly defensive structures with little attacking intent – which are colloquially often referred to as "[[anti-football]]" or "[[Park the bus (football term)|parking the bus]]", and which have been employed at times by managers such as [[José Mourinho]] and [[Diego Simeone]] – are often arbitrarily and incorrectly labelled as ''Catenaccio'' by pundits, managers, and players, but this deviates from the original design of the system; while ''catenaccio'' was similarly an organised system that involved tactical discipline and deep, heavy, and patient defending off – or even behind – the ball, it also made use of now obsolete man-to-man marking, a sweeper, who was tasked with protecting the back-line and also starting plays after winning back possession, as well as employing sudden counter-attacks to score goals.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/sep/22/football-tactics-trends |title= The Question: Could the sweeper be on his way back? |work=The Guardian |date=22 September 2009|access-date=19 June 2012 |location=London |first=Jonathan |last=Wilson}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/the-beauty-of-catenaccio-style-of-football |title=The beauty of 'Catenaccio' style of Football |publisher=Sportskeeda.com |last1=Chakraborty |first1=Abhishek |date=2 June 2012 |access-date=19 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/catenaccio-rules |title=Catenaccio rules! |publisher=sportskeeda.com |author1=Zico |date=7 June 2010 |access-date=19 May 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Manchester City and Chelsea continue to learn the lessons of Sacchi's revolution |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/28/manchester-city-and-chelsea-continue-to-learn-the-lessons-of-sacchis-revolution |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210528165442/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/28/manchester-city-and-chelsea-continue-to-learn-the-lessons-of-sacchis-revolution |date=28 May 2021 |archive-date=28 May 2021 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |last=Lahm |first=Philipp |access-date=29 May 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Italian football===
Although ''Catenaccio'' has still come to be associated with the Italy national side and Italian club teams, due to its historic association with Italian football, it is actually used quite infrequently by [[Serie A]] and Italy national teams in contemporary football, who instead currently prefer to apply balanced tactics and formations, mostly using the 5–3–2 or 3–5–2 system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1391041-4-2-3-1-is-the-new-normal-but-is-serie-as-3-5-2-the-antidote |title=4-2-3-1 Is the New Normal, but Is Serie A's 3-5-2 the Antidote? |author=Will Tidey |date=8 August 2012 |publisher=BleacherReport.com |access-date=4 January 2013}}</ref> For example, under manager [[Cesare Prandelli]], the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] also initially used the 3–5–2 formation, which had been popularised by Juventus manager [[Antonio Conte]] throughout the [[2011–12 Serie A|previous Serie A season]] following his success in the league; although Prandelli used a ball–playing sweeper, he also used attacking wing-backs and a more offensive–minded approach with Italy. In their first two clashes of [[UEFA Euro 2012 Group C]], the system resulted in two 1–1 draws against Spain and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. He subsequently switched to a stylish attacking possession-based system using their 'standard' 4–4–2 diamond formation for the knockout stages; the switch proved to be effective, as the team went on to reach the [[UEFA Euro 2012 final|final]], where they suffered defeat to a similarly more offensive-minded [[Spain men's national football team|Spain side]], who used a possession–based strategy based on passing known as ''tiki-taka''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/20424/prandellis-revolution?page=1 |title=Prandelli's revolution |publisher=Football Italia |last1=Fleming |first1=Scott |date=26 June 2012 |access-date=26 February 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news  | last = Hayward  | first = Paul  | title = Euro 2012: Cesare Prandelli gets Italy playing with as much heart as head to reach final against Spain  | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/euro-2012/9365975/Euro-2012-Cesare-Prandelli-gets-Italy-playing-with-as-much-heart-as-head-to-reach-final-against-Spain.html  | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]  | date = 29 June 2012  | access-date = 2 July 2012  | url-status = live  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120701143434/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/euro-2012/9365975/Euro-2012-Cesare-Prandelli-gets-Italy-playing-with-as-much-heart-as-head-to-reach-final-against-Spain.html  | archive-date = 1 July 2012  | df = dmy-all  }}</ref><ref name="cambia">{{cite web |url=https://sport.sky.it/calcio-estero/fotogallery/2014/09/04/evoluzione_tattica_italia_zoff_trapattoni_donadoni_lippi_prandelli_conte.html#3 |title=L'Italia che cambia: per ogni ct c'è un modulo diverso |publisher=sport.sky.it |language=it |date=20 December 2016 |access-date=26 February 2020 |archive-date=20 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210120192152/https://sport.sky.it/calcio-estero/fotogallery/2014/09/04/evoluzione_tattica_italia_zoff_trapattoni_donadoni_lippi_prandelli_conte.html#3 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title = Napolitano a Prandelli &quot;Se andava via mi sarei arrabbiato&quot; – | url = http://www.repubblica.it/speciali/calcio/europei/polonia-ucraina2012/squadre/italia/2012/07/02/news/tornata_la_nazionale-38404614/ | language = it | publisher = [[La Repubblica]] online, www.repubblica.it | date = 2 July 2012 | access-date = 2 July 2012 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120703080848/http://www.repubblica.it/speciali/calcio/europei/polonia-ucraina2012/squadre/italia/2012/07/02/news/tornata_la_nazionale-38404614/ | archive-date = 3 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Rob Smyth of ''[[The Guardian]]'' was critical of Spain's striker–less formation and particular brand of ''[[tiki-taka]]'' at UEFA Euro 2012, believing that the lack of emphasis on the offensive aspect of the game led to fewer goals, and that the team's seemingly endless passing and preoccupation with ball–possession was in fact boring, dubbing it "Tiki-takanaccio", a reference to the defensive–minded ''catenaccio'' tactical system, despite the fact that ''tiki-taka'' had ironically originated from the more offensive minded Dutch ''total football'' strategy.<ref name="boring">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jun/30/euro-2012-spain-boring |title=Euro 2012: Spain wear tag of boring for lack of excitement and goals |work=The Guardian |last1=Smyth |first1=Rob |location=London |date=30 June 2012 |access-date=17 May 2020 }}</ref> Prandelli did make use of a more organised and defensive [[Formation (association football)#3–4–3|3–4–3 formation]] against Spain during the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]] semi-final, attempting to stifle Spain's possession game by reducing spaces, and subsequently hitting them on the counter-attack; the system proved to be more effective, as Italy created several opportunities and were only eliminated on penalties following a goalless draw.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2648369-italy-and-spain-renew-rivalry-to-begin-euro-2016-knockout-round |title=Italy and Spain Renew Rivalry in 1st Euro 2016 Knockout Round |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=Lopresti |first1=Sam |language=en |date=25 June 2016 |access-date=28 May 2024 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1686857-confederations-cup-2013-results-score-and-highlights-from-spain-vs-italy |title=Confederations Cup 2013 Results: Score and Highlights from Spain vs. Italy |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=Zucker |first1=Joseph |language=en |date=27 June 2013 |access-date=29 May 2024 }}</ref>

Previously, [[Azeglio Vicini]], on the other hand, had led Italy to the semi-finals of both [[UEFA Euro 1988]] and the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], on home soil, thanks to a more attractive, offensive-minded possession based system, which was combined with a solid back-line and elements of the Italian ''zona mista'' ("mixed zone" in Italian) approach, or ''gioco all'italiana'', which was a cross between zonal marking and man-marking systems, such as ''catenaccio''. Despite their more aggressive attacking approach under Vicini during the latter tournament, Italy initially struggled in the first round, before recovering their form in the knock-out stages, and produced small wins in five hard-fought games against defensive sides, in which they scored little but risked even less, totalling only seven goals for and none against leading up to the semi-finals of the competition. Italy would then lose a tight semi-final on penalties following a 1–1 draw with [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], due in no small part to a more defensive strategy from [[Carlos Bilardo]], who then went on to lose the [[1990 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] 1–0 to a much more offensive-minded [[Germany national football team|Germany]] side led by manager [[Franz Beckenbauer]].

Vicini's successor as the Italy national side's manager, [[Arrigo Sacchi]], also attempted to introduce his more attacking–minded tactical philosophy, which had been highly successful with Milan, to the Italy national team; his tactics, which were inspired by Dutch ''total football'', made use of an aggressive high-[[Glossary of association football terms#P|pressing]] system, which used a [[Formation (association football)#4–4–2|4–4–2 formation]], an attractive, fast, attacking, and possession-based playing style, and which also used innovative elements such as zonal marking and a high defensive line playing the [[Offside (association football)#Offside trap|offside trap]], which largely deviated from previous systems in Italian football, despite still maintaining defensive solidity. Italy initially struggled to replicate the system successfully, and encountered mixed results.

Previously, at the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]], [[Enzo Bearzot]]'s Italian side also often adopted an attractive, offensive-minded possession game based on passing, creativity, movement, attacking flair, and technique, due to the individual skill of his players; the front three would also often change positions with one another, in order to disorient the opposing defenders. Italy finished the tournament in fourth place, a result they replicated two years later at [[UEFA Euro 1980]] on home soil. At the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]], he instead adopted a more flexible and balanced tactical approach, which was based on the ''zona mista'' system, and which used a fluid 4–3–3 formation, with [[Gaetano Scirea]] as a sweeper, who held both defensive and creative duties. While the team were organised and highly effective defensively, they were also capable of getting forward and scoring from quick counter-attacks, or keeping possession when necessary. The system proved to be highly effective as Italy went on to win the title.<ref name="genio"/><ref name="game">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=61538/profile.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312065534/http://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=61538/profile.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 March 2017|title=Bearzot: 'Football is first and foremost a game'|publisher=FIFA|access-date=9 March 2017}}</ref><ref name="Bearzot Guardian Obituary">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/dec/21/enzo-bearzot-obituary|title=Enzo Bearzot obituary|work=The Guardian|author1=Brian Glanville|date=21 December 2010|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref> Bearzot's Italy side were also known for their solidity, aggression, and defensive strength, possessing a number of hard–tackling players in their team, such as midfielder [[Marco Tardelli]], and defenders [[Claudio Gentile]] and [[Giuseppe Bergomi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/forum/printable.asp?m=1554851 |title=Top 50 Hardest Footballers |work=The Times |date=13 August 2007 |access-date=22 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019002225/http://www.empireonline.com/forum/printable.asp?m=1554851 |archive-date=19 October 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref> Gentile, who served as the team's ''stopper'', or man-marking centre-back, gained a degree of infamy in the media for his highly physical man-marking of [[Diego Maradona]] in Italy's second-round match against Argentina; although controversial, the strategy proved to be effective as Gentile essentially nullified the Argentine playmaker's impact on the game, with Italy winning the match 2–1.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/world-cup/columns/story/_/id/5146962/ce/us/thugs-hard-men |title=Soccer isn't for ballerinas |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Hirshey |first1=David |last2=Bennett |first2=Roger |date=29 April 2010 |access-date=20 May 2020 }}</ref>

The ten-man team was playing with a 4–3–2 scheme, just a midfielder away from the team's regular 4–4–2 system. In a tightly-contested match, Italy went on to keep a clean sheet and earned a 1–0 victory through a controversial injury-time penalty.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jun/27/worldcup2006.match | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Totti steps up to redeem erratic Italy | first=Richard | last=Williams | date=27 June 2006 | access-date=28 April 2010 }}</ref> 

During his tenure with the Italy national team, Conte returned to Italy's traditional tactical roots, adopting a more organised, defensive-minded, counter-attacking approach, due to the perceived lack of talent in the side at the time, as well as injuries to key players. He used a fluid 3–5–2 formation at [[UEFA Euro 2016]], in which the wide midfielders or wingbacks effectively functioned as wingers in a 3–3–4 formation when attacking, and as fullbacks in a 5–3–2 formation when defending behind the ball.<ref name="new special one">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/06/15/italy-hail-the-new-special-one-antonio-conte/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/06/15/italy-hail-the-new-special-one-antonio-conte/ |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Italy hail the new 'special one' Antonio Conte|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=James|last=Ducker|date=15 June 2016|access-date=2 February 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name="never underestimate">{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/european-championship/74/blog/post/2898768/italys-start-to-euro-2016-shows-you-should-never-underestimate-them|title=Italy's start to Euro 2016 shows you should never underestimate them|publisher=ESPN FC|first=James|last=Horncastle|date=21 June 2016|access-date=3 July 2016|archive-date=10 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710224405/http://www.espnfc.us/european-championship/74/blog/post/2898768/italys-start-to-euro-2016-shows-you-should-never-underestimate-them|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Bull |first1=J.
