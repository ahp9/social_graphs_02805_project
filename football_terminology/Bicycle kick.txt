In [[association football]], a '''bicycle kick''', also known as an '''overhead kick''' or '''scissors kick''', is an acrobatic strike where a player kicks an airborne [[Ball (association football)|ball]] rearward in midair. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air and, before descending to the ground, making a shearing movement with the legs to get the ball-striking leg in front of the other. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the [[cycling]] motion or the [[Scissors|scissor]] motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.{{efn-ua|Turner refers to the bicycle kick as "[t]he apex of wonder-goals",{{sfn|Turner|2011|loc=Ephemeral Goals & Eternal Glory}} and Witzig defines it as "the most spectacular—yet the most opportunistic and desperate—move that exists in soccer".{{sfn|Witzig|2006|p=22}}}}

Bicycle kicks can be used defensively to clear away the ball from the goalmouth or offensively to strike at the opponent's goal in an attempt to score. The bicycle kick is an advanced football skill that is dangerous for inexperienced players. Its successful performance has been limited largely to the most experienced and athletic players in [[History of association football|football history]].

[[Working class|Labourers]] from the Pacific seaports of [[Chile]] and [[Peru]] likely performed the first bicycle kicks in football matches, possibly as early as the late 19th century. Advanced techniques like the bicycle kick developed from South American adaptations to the football style introduced by [[British diaspora|British immigrants]]. Brazilian footballers [[Leônidas (footballer, born 1913)|Leônidas]] and [[Pelé]] popularized the skill internationally during the 20th century. The bicycle kick has since attained such a wide allure that, in 2016, [[FIFA]] (association football's [[Sports governing body|governing body]]) regarded the bicycle kick as "football's most spectacular sight".

As an iconic skill, bicycle kicks are an important part of [[association football culture]]. Executing a bicycle kick in a competitive football match, particularly in scoring a goal, usually garners wide attention in the [[Sports journalism|sports media]]. The bicycle kick has been featured in works of art, such as sculptures, films, advertisements, and literature. Controversies over the move's invention and naming have added to the kick's acclaim in popular culture. The manoeuvre is also admired in similar ball sports, particularly in the variants of association football like [[futsal]] and [[beach soccer]].

[[File:Chilena de Sergio Ramos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=Photograph of a football match|[[Real Madrid]] defender [[Sergio Ramos]] (''in white'') uses a bicycle kick against rivals [[Athletic Bilbao]] in a ''[[La Liga]]'' match in 2010.]]
The bicycle kick is known in English by three names: bicycle kick, overhead kick, and scissors kick. The term "bicycle kick" describes the action of the legs while the body is in mid-air, resembling the pedalling of a bicycle.{{sfn|Tyagi|2010|loc=Football Terms}} The manoeuvre is also called an "overhead kick", which refers to the ball being kicked above the head,{{sfn|Bischops|Gerards|2003|p=88}} or a "scissors kick", as the technique reflects the movement of two scissor blades coming together.{{sfn|Schmidt|1997|p=88}} Some authors differentiate the "scissors kick" as similar to a bicycle kick, but done sideways or at an angle;<ref>See:
*{{harvnb|Witzig|2006|p=22}}
*{{harvnb|Borden|2009|p=138}}
*{{harvnb|Gardner|1994|pp=144, 148}}</ref> other authors consider them to be the same move.<ref>See:
*{{harvnb|Ruiz|2003|loc=Perfect Shooting}}
*{{harvnb|Rull|2004|p=166}}
*{{harvnb|Schmidt|1997|p=88}}</ref>

In languages other than English, its name also reflects the action it resembles. Sports journalist Alejandro Cisternas, from Chilean newspaper ''[[El Mercurio]]'', compiled a list of these names.<ref name=Cisternas>{{cite web|author=Alejandro Cisternas|publisher=El Mercurio S.A.P.|url=http://diario.elmercurio.cl/detalle/index.asp?id={94d4d5e9-b792-408e-ad03-60d56e61d1bf}|title=En Todas Partes Se Llama Chilena|work=El Mercurio|date=23 March 2009|access-date=7 July 2015|language=es}}</ref> In most cases, they either refer to the kick's scissor-like motion, such as the French ''ciseaux retourné'' (returned scissors) and the Greek ''anapodo psalidi'' (upside down scissors), or to its bicycle-like action, such as the Portuguese ''pontapé de bicicleta''.<ref name=Cisternas /> In other languages, the nature of the action is described: German ''Fallrückzieher'' (falling backward kick), [[Polish language|Polish]] ''przewrotka'' (overturn kick), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''omhaal'' (turnaround drag), and Italian ''rovesciata'' (reversed kick).<ref name=Cisternas />

Exceptions to these naming patterns are found in languages that designate the move by making reference to a location, such as the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''brassespark'' (Brazilian kick).<ref name=Cisternas />{{sfn|Coppock|2001|p=139}} This exception is most significant in Spanish, where a fierce controversy exists between Chile and Peru—as part of their [[Chile–Peru football rivalry|historic sports rivalry]]—over the naming of the bicycle kick; Chileans and most Latin Americans know it as the ''chilena'', while Peruvians call it the ''chalaca''.<ref>See:

* {{harvnb|United States Soccer Federation|Lewis|2000|loc=The Bicycle Kick}}</ref> To perform a bicycle kick, the ball must be airborne so that the player can hit it while doing a backflip; the ball can either come in the air towards the player, such as from a [[Cross (association football)|cross]], or the player can flick the ball up into the air.{{sfn|DK Publishing|2011|p=98}} The non-kicking leg should rise first to help propel the body up while the kicking leg makes the jump.<ref>See:

Bicycle kicks are generally done in two situations, one defensive and the other offensive. A defensive bicycle kick is done when a player facing their side's goal uses the action to clear the ball in the direction opposite their side's goalmouth. Sports historian Richard Witzig considers defensive bicycle kicks a desperate move requiring less aim than its offensive variety.{{sfn|Witzig|2006|p=22}} An offensive bicycle kick is used when a player has their back to the opposing goal and is near the goalmouth. According to Witzig, the offensive bicycle kick requires concentration and a good understanding of the ball's location.{{sfn|Witzig|2006|p=22}} Bicycle kicks can also be done in the midfield, but this is not recommended because safer and more accurate passes can be done in this zone.{{sfn|Witzig|2006|p=22}}

Crosses that precede an offensive bicycle kick are of dubious accuracy—German [[Forward (association football)|striker]] [[Klaus Fischer]] reportedly stated that most crosses prior to a bicycle kick are bad.{{sfn|Simpson|Hesse|2013|p=3}} Moreover, performing a bicycle kick is dangerous, even when done correctly, as it may harm a startled participant in the field.<ref>See:

Witzig recommends that footballers attempt executing a bicycle kick with a focused and determined state of mind.{{sfn|Witzig|2006|p=22}} The performer needs to maintain good form when executing the move, and must simultaneously exhibit exceptional accuracy and precision when striking the ball.<ref>See:

British immigrants, attracted by South America's economic prospects, including the export of [[Coffee production in Brazil|coffee from Brazil]], [[Hide (skin)|hide]] and [[Argentine beef|meat from Argentina]], and [[Guano Era|guano from Peru]], introduced football to the region during the 1800s.{{sfn|Wilson|2013|p=21}} These immigrant communities founded institutions, such as schools and sporting clubs, where activities mirrored those done in Britain—including the practice of football.{{sfn|Wilson|2013|p=21}} Football's practice had previously spread from Britain to continental Europe, principally Belgium, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, but the game had no innovations in these locations.{{sfn|Wilson|2013|p=22}} Matters developed differently in South America because, rather than simply imitate the immigrants' style of play—based more on the slower "[[Combination Game|Scottish passing game]]" than on the faster and rougher English football style—the South Americans contributed to the sport's growth by emphasizing the players' technical qualities.<ref name="British Football">See:
