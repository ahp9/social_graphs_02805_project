In [[association football]], a '''midfielder''' takes an [[Glossary of association football terms#O|outfield position]] primarily in the middle of the pitch.<ref name="BBCsport1">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197190.stm|title=Positions guide: Central midfield|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=27 August 2013|date=1 September 2005|location=London|archive-date=11 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311140237/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197190.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> Midfielders may play an exclusively defensive role, breaking up attacks, and are in that case known as defensive midfielders. As [[#Central midfielder|central midfielders]] often go across boundaries, with mobility and passing ability, they are often referred to as deep-lying midfielders, play-makers, box-to-box midfielders, or holding midfielders. There are also attacking midfielders with limited defensive assignments.

The size of midfield units on a team and their assigned roles depend on which [[Formation (association football)|formation]] is used; the unit of these players on the pitch is commonly referred to as the '''midfield'''.<ref name="ExpertFootball1">{{cite web|title=Football / Soccer Positions|url=http://expertfootball.com/coaching/positions.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123010101/http://expertfootball.com/coaching/positions.php|archive-date=23 November 2012|access-date=21 June 2008|website=Keanu salah|publisher=Expert Football}}</ref> Its name derives from the fact that midfield units typically make up the in-between units to the [[Defender (association football)|defensive]] units and [[Forward (association football)|forward]] units of a [[Formation (association football)|formation]].

[[Manager (association football)|Managers]] frequently assign one or more midfielders to disrupt the opposing team's attacks, while others may be tasked with creating goals, or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence. Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match. Midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game, and thus they are some of the fittest players on the pitch.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Di Salvo |first=V. |title=Performance characteristics according to playing position in elite soccer |journal=International Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=222–227 |date=6 October 2005 |doi=10.1055/s-2006-924294 |pmid=17024626|s2cid=46557339 }}</ref> Midfielders are often assigned the task of [[assist (association football)|assisting]] forwards to create scoring opportunities.

Central midfielders are players whose role is divided between attacking and defensive duties to control the play in and around the centre of the pitch. These players will try to [[Passing (association football)|pass]] the ball to the team's [[#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielders]] and forwards and may also help their team's attacks by making runs into the opposition's [[penalty area]] and attempting [[Shooting (association football)|shots]] on goal themselves. They also provide secondary support to [[Forward (association football)|attackers]], both in and out of possession.

When the opposing team has the ball, a central midfielder may drop back to protect the goal or move forward and [[Glossary of association football terms#P|press]] the opposition ball-carrier to recover the ball. A centre midfielder defending their goal will move in front of their [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-backs]] to block long [[Shooting (association football)|shots]] by the opposition and track opposition midfielders making runs towards the goal.

=== Mezzala ===
In Italian football, the term ''mezzala'' (literally "half-winger" in Italian) is used to describe the position of the one or two central midfielders who play on either side of a holding midfielder and/or playmaker. The term was initially applied to the role of an [[Forward (association football)#Inside forward|inside forward]] in the [[Formation (association football)#WM|WM]] and ''[[Formation (association football)#Metodo (2–3–2–3)|Metodo]]'' formations in Italian, but later described a specific type of central midfielder. The mezzala is often a quick and hard-working attack-minded midfielder, with good skills and noted offensive capabilities, as well as a tendency to make overlapping attacking runs, but also a player who participates in the defensive aspect of the game, and who can give width to a team by drifting out wide; as such, the term can be applied to several different roles. In English, the term has come to be seen as a variant of the box-to-box midfielder role.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/127534/just-what-mezzala |title=Just what is a mezzala? |publisher=Football Italia |last1=Tallarita |first1=Andrea |date=4 September 2018 |access-date=3 January 2020 |archive-date=31 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731234253/https://www.football-italia.net/127534/just-what-mezzala |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/italian-english/mezzala |title=English translation of 'mezzala' |publisher=Collins Dictionary |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=2 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210702093232/https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/italian-english/mezzala |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11096/11258105/how-antonio-conte-got-the-best-from-paul-pogba-at-juventus |title=How Antonio Conte got the best from Paul Pogba at Juventus |publisher=Sky Sports |last1=Walker-Roberts |first1=James |date=25 February 2018 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=23 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211123115857/https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11096/11258105/how-antonio-conte-got-the-best-from-paul-pogba-at-juventus |url-status=live }}</ref>

Initially, a defensive midfielder, or "destroyer", and a playmaker, or "creator", were often fielded alongside each other as a team's two holding central midfielders. The destroyer was usually responsible for making tackles, regaining possession, and distributing the ball to the creator, while the creator was responsible for retaining possession and keeping the ball moving, often with long passes out to the flanks, in the manner of a more old-fashioned deep-lying playmaker or ''regista'' (see below).<ref name="WilsonHolding13"/> Earlier examples of a destroyer are [[Nobby Stiles]], [[Herbert Wimmer]], and [[Marco Tardelli]], while later examples include [[Claude Makélélé]] and [[Javier Mascherano]],<ref name="WilsonHolding13"/> although several of these players also possessed qualities of other types of midfielders, and were therefore not confined to a single role.{{cn|date=June 2023}} Early examples of a creator would be [[Gérson]], [[Glenn Hoddle]], and [[Sunday Oliseh]], while more recent examples are [[Xabi Alonso]],<ref name="WilsonHolding13"/> as well as [[Michael Carrick]] and [[Keira Walsh]].<ref>{{cite web|date=2022-09-13|title=Keira Walsh – The Metronome|url=https://analyticsfc.co.uk/blog/2022/09/13/keira-walsh-the-metronome/ |access-date=2022-09-13|website=Analytics FC}}</ref>

The latest and third type of holding midfielder developed as a box-to-box midfielder, or "carrier" or "surger", neither entirely destructive nor creative, who is capable of winning back possession and subsequently advancing from deeper positions either by distributing the ball to a teammate and making late runs into the box, or by carrying the ball themselves; recent examples of this type of player are [[Clarence Seedorf]] and [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]], while [[Sami Khedira]] and [[Fernandinho (footballer, born May 1985)|Fernandinho]] are destroyers with carrying tendencies. [[Luka Modrić]] is a carrier with several qualities of the ''regista'', and [[Yaya Touré]] was a carrier who became a playmaker later in his career after losing his stamina.<ref name="WilsonHolding13" /> [[N'Golo Kanté]] started out as the quintessential destroyer, but developed carrying tendencies under [[Antonio Conte]] at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].{{cn|date=October 2023}}

Writer [[Jonathan Wilson (writer)|Jonathan Wilson]] instead described [[Xabi Alonso]]'s holding midfield role as that of a "creator", a player who was responsible for retaining possession in the manner of a more old-fashioned deep-lying playmaker or ''regista'', noting that: "although capable of making tackles, [Alonso] focused on keeping the ball moving, occasionally raking long passes out to the flanks to change the angle of attack."<ref name="WilsonHolding13"/>

=== Centre-half ===
The historic central half-back position gradually retreated from the midfield line to provide increased protection to the back line against centre-forwards – that [[centre-back|dedicated defensive role in the centre]] is still commonly referred to as a "centre-half" as a legacy of its origins.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Wilson |title=The Question: Did Herbert Chapman really invent the W-M formation? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/sep/20/arsenal-herbert-chapman-southampton-tactics |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 September 2011 |access-date=9 April 2012 |archive-date=26 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226104619/http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/sep/20/arsenal-herbert-chapman-southampton-tactics |url-status=live }}</ref> In Italian football jargon, this position was known as the ''centromediano metodista'' or ''metodista'', as it became an increasingly important role in [[Vittorio Pozzo]]'s ''[[Formation (association football)#Metodo (2–3–2–3)|metodo]]'' system, although this term was later also applied to describe players who operated in a central holding-midfielder role, but who also had creative responsibilities in addition to defensive duties.<ref name="ritiri e regista"/>

==Attacking midfielder==
An attacking midfielder is a midfield or forward player who is positioned in an advanced midfield position, usually between central midfield and the team's forwards, and who has a primarily offensive role.<ref name="Talk">{{cite web |url=http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/positions_in_football.html |title=Positions in football |publisher=talkfootball.co.uk |access-date=21 June 2008 |archive-date=23 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823205739/http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/positions_in_football.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Some attacking midfielders are called ''trequartista'' or ''fantasista'' ({{langx|it|three-quarter specialist}}, i.e. a creative [[Playmaker#Advanced playmakers|playmaker]] between the forwards and the midfield), who are usually mobile, creative and highly skillful players, known for their deft touch, technical ability, dribbling skills, vision, ability to shoot from long range, and passing prowess.

However, not all attacking midfielders are trequartistas – some attacking midfielders are very vertical and are essentially auxiliary attackers who serve to link-up play, hold up the ball, or provide the final pass, i.e. [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|secondary strikers]].<ref name=number10>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertomancini.com/en/carriera-2/the-number-10.html|title=The Number 10|publisher=Roberto Mancini|access-date=13 July 2016|archive-date=19 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219143748/http://www.robertomancini.com/en/carriera-2/the-number-10.html|url-status=live}}</ref> As with any attacking player, the role of the attacking midfielder involves being able to create space for attack.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Michalak |first1=Joakim |title=Identifying football players who create and generate space |url=http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&c=30&af=%5B%5D&searchType=LIST_LATEST&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&query=&language=en&pid=diva2%3A1687971&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&sf=all&aqe=%5B%5D&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&noOfRows=50&dswid=6728 |publisher=Uppsala University Publications |access-date=22 August 2022 |archive-date=8 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408114248/http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?aq2=&#91;&#93;&#93;&c=30&af=&#93;&searchType=LIST_LATEST&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&query=&language=en&pid=diva2:1687971&aq=&#93;&sf=all&aqe=&#93;&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&noOfRows=50&dswid=6728 |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to positioning along the field, attacking midfield may be divided into ''left'', ''right'' and ''central attacking midfield'' roles but most importantly they are a striker behind the forwards. A central attacking midfielder may be referred to as a ''[[playmaker]]'', or ''number 10'' (due to the association of the [[Squad number (association football)|number 10 shirt]] with this position).<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/aug/18/what-is-a-playmakers-role-in-modern-game|title = The Question: What is a playmaker's role in the modern game?|date = 18 August 2010|access-date = 1 December 2014|website = TheGuardian.com|last = Wilson|first = Jonathan|archive-date = 26 May 2023|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230526173923/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/aug/18/what-is-a-playmakers-role-in-modern-game|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/26/trequartista-engance-classic-no-10sstruggle/|title = How the 2000s changed tactics #2: Classic Number 10s struggle|date = 26 March 2010|access-date = 1 December 2014|website = ZonalMarking.net|last = Cox|first = Michael|archive-date = 8 April 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190408182809/http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/26/trequartista-engance-classic-no-10sstruggle/|url-status = dead}}</ref>

These players typically serve as the offensive pivot of the team, and are sometimes said to be "playing in the hole", although this term can also be used as deep-lying forward. The attacking midfielder is an important position that requires the player to possess superior technical abilities in terms of passing and [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]], as well as, perhaps more importantly, the ability to read the opposing defence to deliver defence-splitting passes to the striker.

This specialist midfielder's main role is to [[Assist (football)|create good shooting and goal-scoring opportunities]] using superior vision, control, and technical skill, by making [[Cross (football)|crosses]], [[wikt:through ball|through balls]], and headed [[wikt:knockdown|knockdowns]] to teammates. They may try to set up shooting opportunities for themselves by [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] or performing a [[give-and-go]] with a teammate. Attacking midfielders may also make runs into the opponents' penalty area to shoot from another teammate's pass.<ref name="ExpertFootball1" />
 	
Where a creative attacking midfielder, i.e. an [[Playmaker#Advanced playmakers|Advanced playmaker]], is regularly utilised, they are commonly the team's star player, and often wear the [[Squad number (association football)|number 10 shirt]]. As such, a team is often constructed so as to allow their attacking midfielder to roam free and create as the situation demands. One such popular formation is the 4–4–2 "diamond" (or 4–1–2–1–2), in which defined attacking and defensive midfielders replace the more traditional pair of central midfielders. Known as the "''fantasista''" or "''trequartista''" in Italy,<ref name=number10/> in Spain, the offensive playmaker is known as the "''Mediapunta'', in Brazil, the offensive playmaker is known as the "''meia atacante''",<ref name="MTV: Playmaker"/> whereas in Argentina and Uruguay, it is known as the "''enganche''".<ref>{{cite web|title=Tactics: the changing role of the playmaker|url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/features/tactics-the-changing-role-of-the-playmaker|access-date=5 January 2015}}</ref> Some examples of the advanced playmaker would be [[Zico (footballer)|Zico]], [[Francesco Totti]], [[Lionel Messi]], [[Diego Maradona]], [[Kevin De Bruyne]], [[James Rodríguez]], [[Wim van Hanegem]] and [[Michel Platini]].

There are also some examples of more flexible advanced playmakers, such as [[Zinedine Zidane]], [[Rui Costa]], [[Kaká]], [[Andrés Iniesta]], [[Juan Román Riquelme]], [[David Silva]], and [[Louisa Cadamuro]]. These players could control the tempo of the game in deeper areas of the pitch while also being able to push forward and play line-breaking through balls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://backpagefootball.com/zinedine-zidane-the-flawed-genius/30147/|work=Back Page Football|title=Zinedine Zidane: The Flawed Genius|author1=Ciaran Kelly|date=7 December 2011|access-date=6 July 2015|archive-date=6 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706184033/http://backpagefootball.com/zinedine-zidane-the-flawed-genius/30147/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Year Zero">{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/year-zero-making-zinedine-zidane-juventus-199697?page=0%2C1 |title=Year Zero: The making of Zinedine Zidane (Juventus, 1996/97) |publisher=FourFourTwo |last1=Bandini |first1=Nicky |date=3 May 2017 |access-date=25 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025075917/https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/year-zero-making-zinedine-zidane-juventus-199697%3Fpage%3D0,1 |archive-date=25 October 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="scudiero">{{cite news |url=https://www.repubblica.it/online/campionato/shevazida/shevazida/shevazida.html |title=Zidane vede il Pallone d'oro ma Sheva è il suo scudiero |work=La Repubblica |language=it |last1=Vincenzi |first1=Massimo |date=4 December 2000 |access-date=25 October 2019 |archive-date=5 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211105144359/https://www.repubblica.it/online/campionato/shevazida/shevazida/shevazida.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="necib_cbc">{{cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/fifawomensworldcup2011/blog/2011/07/more-to-come-from-louisa-necib.html | title = More to come from Louisa Necib | date = 14 July 2011 | work = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] | access-date = 11 September 2011 | language = fr | archive-date = 10 November 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121110103742/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/fifawomensworldcup2011/blog/2011/07/more-to-come-from-louisa-necib.html | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name="go-to man">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jun/18/worldcup2006.sport8 |title=Lonesome Riquelme is the go-to man |work=The Guardian |author1=Jason Cowley |date=18 June 2006 |access-date=16 March 2019 |archive-date=31 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211031012227/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jun/18/worldcup2006.sport8 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Mesut Özil]] can be considered as a classic 10 who adopted a slightly more direct approach and specialised in playing the final ball.

=== False attacking midfielder ===
The false attacking midfielder (falso trequartista, in Italian – not to be confused with ''[[Midfielder#Advanced_playmaker|trequartista]]'' or ''[[Midfielder#"False_10"_or_"central_winger"|false ten]]'') description has been used in [[Football in Italy|Italian football]] to describe a player who is seemingly playing as an attacking midfielder in a 4–3–1–2 formation or a 4–4–2 diamond, but who eventually drops deeper into midfield, drawing opposing players out of position and creating space to be exploited by teammates making attacking runs; the false-attacking midfielder will eventually sit in a central midfield role and function as a [[Playmaker#Deep-lying playmakers|deep-lying playmaker]]. The false-attacking midfielder is, therefore, usually a creative and tactically intelligent player with good vision, technique, movement, passing ability, and striking ability from a distance. They should also be a hard-working player, who is able to read the game and help the team defensively. [[Riccardo Montolivo]] and [[Thiago Motta]], among other players, were occasionally used in this role under [[Italy national football team|Italy]] manager [[Cesare Prandelli]], with his system essentially resembling a 4–1–3–2 formation.<ref name="Horncastle: Riccardo Montolivo straddles both sides of the Germany/Italy divide">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thescore.com/counterattack/2012/06/28/horncastle-riccardo-montolivo-straddles-both-sides-of-the-germanyitaly-divide/|title=Horncastle: Riccardo Montolivo straddles both sides of the Germany/Italy divide|publisher=The Score|author=James Horncastle|access-date=20 August 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140820165844/http://blogs.thescore.com/counterattack/2012/06/28/horncastle-riccardo-montolivo-straddles-both-sides-of-the-germanyitaly-divide/|archive-date=20 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Italia-Usa finisce 0-1 |url=https://www.ilsecoloxix.it/sport/2012/03/01/news/italia-usa-finisce-0-1-1.32601757 |access-date=9 September 2025 |work=Il Secolo XIX |date=1 March 2012 |language=it}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Manusia |first1=Daniele |title=Report post-partita, Italia-Inghilterra 4-2 |url=https://www.vice.com/it/article/stili-di-gioco-italia-inghilterra/ |access-date=9 September 2025 |work=VICE |date=25 June 2012 |language=it-IT}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Lowe |first1=Sid |title=Euro 2012: How Italy coach Cesare Prandelli won admirers aplenty |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jun/20/euro-2012-cesare-prandelli-italy |access-date=9 September 2025 |work=The Guardian |date=20 June 2012}}</ref> [[Wayne Rooney]] has been deployed in a similar role, on occasion during his time under [[Alex Ferguson]] at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]; seemingly positioned as a number 10 behind the main striker, he would often drop even deeper into midfield to help his team retrieve possession and start attacks.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/dec/20/football-tactical-trends-of-2011 |title=The football tactical trends of 2011 |work=the Guardian |last=Wilson |first=Jonathan |date=20 December 2011 |access-date=17 April 2022 }}</ref>

=== {{anchor|fals10}} "False 10" or "central winger" ===
[[File:Mesut Özil.jpg|thumb|right|Advanced playmaker [[Mesut Özil]] was used as a false 10 with [[Germany national football team|Germany]] during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].]]

The "false 10" or "central winger"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/12/03/introducing-the-central-winger/ | title = Introducing…the central winger? | publisher = zonalmarking.net | date = 3 December 2010 | access-date = 27 August 2013 | archive-date = 7 November 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191107203917/http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/12/03/introducing-the-central-winger/ | url-status = dead }}</ref> is a type of midfielder, which differs from the trequartista. Much like the "[[false 9]]", their specificity lies in the fact that, although they seemingly play as an attacking midfielder on paper, unlike a traditional playmaker who stays behind the striker in the centre of the pitch, the false 10's goal is to move out of position and drift wide when in possession of the ball to help both the wingers and fullbacks to overload the flanks. This means two problems for the opposing midfielders: either they let the false 10 drift wide, and their presence, along with both the winger and the fullback, creates a three-on-two player advantage out wide; or they follow the false 10, but leave space in the centre of the pitch for wingers or onrushing midfielders to exploit. False 10s are usually traditional wingers who are told to play in the centre of the pitch, and their natural way of playing makes them drift wide and look to provide deliveries into the box for teammates. On occasion, the false-10 can also function in a different manner alongside a false-9, usually in a 4–6–0 formation, disguised as either a 4–3–3 or 4–2–3–1 formation. When other forwards or false-9s drop deep and draw defenders away from the false-10s, creating space in the middle of the pitch, the false-10 will then also surprise defenders by exploiting this space and moving out of position once again, often undertaking offensive dribbling runs forward towards goal, or running on to passes from false-9s, which in turn enables them to create goalscoring opportunities or go for goal themselves.<ref name="The False-10">{{cite web|url=http://www.tomwfootball.com/2010/06/16/world-cup-tactics-after-the-false-nine-the-false-10/|title=The False-10|access-date=16 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111005139/http://www.tomwfootball.com/2010/06/16/world-cup-tactics-after-the-false-nine-the-false-10/|archive-date=11 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In&nbsp;modern football, the terms winger or wide player refer to a non-defender who plays on the left or right sides of the pitch. These terms can apply to left or right [[Forward (association football)|forwards]].<ref name=":1" /> Left or right-sided defenders such as [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing-backs]] or left or right midfielders, left or right attacking midfielders, or [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-backs]] are generally not called wingers.

In the [[Formation (association football)#2.E2.80.933.E2.80.935 .28Pyramid.29|2−3−5]] formation popular in the late 19th century wingers remained mostly near the touchlines of the pitch, and were expected to cross the ball for the team's [[Forward (association football)#Inside forward|inside]] and [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre forwards]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.fl125.co.uk/features/feature-articles/tactics|title = It's a Simple Game|date = 2013|access-date = 1 December 2014|website = Football League 125|last = Wilson|first = Jonathan|archive-date = 5 April 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405073009/http://www.fl125.co.uk/features/feature-articles/tactics|url-status = live}}</ref> Traditionally, wingers were purely attacking players and were not expected to track back and defend. This began to change in the 1960s. In the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]], [[England national football team|England]] [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Alf Ramsey]] did not select wingers from the quarter-final onwards. This team was known as the "Wingless Wonders" and led to the modern 4–4–2 formation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Galvin |first=Robert |title=Sir Alf Ramsey |url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/pages/fame/Inductees/siralframsey.htm |publisher=National Football Museum |access-date=11 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606014343/http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/pages/fame/Inductees/siralframsey.htm |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=unfit }}</ref><ref name="FIFA">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=107/edition=248388/news/newsid=103183.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107163936/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=107/edition=248388/news/newsid=103183.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 November 2008|title=Chelsea prayers fly to the wings|date=5 March 2006|publisher=FIFA|access-date=25 June 2008}}</ref>

This has led to most modern wide players having a more demanding role in the sense that they are expected to provide defensive cover for their full-backs and track back to repossess the ball, as well as provide skillful crosses for centre forwards and strikers.<ref name="BBCsport2" /> Some forwards are able to operate as wingers behind a lone striker. In a three-man midfield, specialist wingers are sometimes deployed down the flanks alongside the central midfielder or playmaker.

Even more demanding is the role of [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing-back]], where the wide player is expected to provide both defence and attack.<ref name="BBCsport4">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197076.stm|title=Positions guide: Wing-back|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=21 June 2008|date=1 September 2005|location=London|archive-date=4 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230404051419/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197076.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> As the role of winger can be classed as a forward or a midfielder, this role instead blurs the divide between defender and midfielder. Italian manager [[Antonio Conte]] has been known to use wide midfielders or wingers who act as wing-backs in his trademark [[Formation (association football)#3–5–2|3–5–2]] and [[Formation (association football)#3–4–3|3–4–3 formations]], for example; these players are expected both to push up and provide width in attack as well as track back and assist their team defensively.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/chelsea/news/the-issues-with-contes-3-5-2 |title=The issues with Antonio Conte's 3-5-2 system |publisher=Sports Illustrated |last1=Debono |first1=Matt |date=17 July 2019 |access-date=15 May 2021 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210515000306/https://www.si.com/soccer/chelsea/news/the-issues-with-contes-3-5-2 |archive-date=15 May 2021 }}</ref>

On occasion, the role of a winger can also be occupied by a different type of player. For example, certain managers have been known to use a "wide target man" on the wing, namely a large and physical player who usually plays as a centre-forward, and who will attempt to win aerial challenges and hold up the ball on the flank, or drag full-backs out of position; [[Romelu Lukaku]], for example, has been used in this role on occasion.<ref name="FM1"/> Another example is [[Mario Mandžukić]] under manager [[Massimiliano Allegri]] at Juventus during the 2016–17 season; normally a striker, he was instead used on the left flank, and was required to win aerial duels, hold up the ball, and create space, as well as being tasked with pressing opposing players.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-champions-juv-mandzukic/versatile-mandzukic-becomes-juves-secret-weapon-idUKKBN1860YF |title=Versatile Mandzukic becomes Juve's secret weapon |work=Reuters |last1=Homewood |first1=Brian |date=10 May 2017 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910110637/https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-champions-juv-mandzukic/versatile-mandzukic-becomes-juves-secret-weapon-idUKKBN1860YF |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:396px-Boisko PositionsWMidfield.PNG|thumb|right|Wingers are indicated in red, while the "wide men" (who play to the flanks of the central midfielders) are indicated in blue.]]

Today, a winger is usually an attacking midfielder who is stationed in a wide position near the touchlines.<ref name="BBCsport2">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197228.stm|title=Positions guide: Wide midfield|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=21 June 2008|date=1 September 2005|location=London|archive-date=21 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921223945/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197228.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> Wingers such as [[Stanley Matthews]] or [[Jimmy Johnstone]] used to be classified as outside forwards in traditional W-shaped formations, and were formally known as "[[Forward (association football)#Outside forward|Outside Right]]" or "[[Forward (association football)#Outside forward|Outside Left]]", but as tactics evolved through the last 40 years, wingers have dropped to deeper field positions and are now usually classified as part of the midfield, usually in 4–4–2 or 4–5–1 formations (but while the team is on the attack, they tend to resemble 4–2–4/2–4–4 and 4–3–3 formations respectively).

The responsibilities of the winger include:
* Providing a "wide presence" as a passing option on the flank.
* To beat the opposing full-back either with skill or with speed.
* To read passes from the midfield that give them a clear crossing opportunity, when going wide, or that give them a clear scoring opportunity, when cutting inside towards the goal.
* To double up on the opposition winger, particularly when they are being "double-marked" by both the team's full back and winger.

The prototypical winger is fast, tricky and enjoys 'hugging' the touchline, that is, running downfield close to the touchline and delivering crosses. However, players with different attributes can thrive on the wing as well. Some wingers prefer to cut ''infield'' (as opposed to staying wide) and pose a threat as playmakers by playing diagonal passes to forwards or taking a shot at goal. Even players who are not considered quick, have been successfully fielded as wingers at club and international level for their ability to create play from the flank. Occasionally wingers are given a free role to roam across the front line and are relieved of defensive responsibilities. [[Johann Cruijff]] frequently exhibited this prowess, as a true model of Total Football, an ultimate "master-style" of play, in its earliest form believed to originate with the [[Hungary national football team]] - and nearly perfected - in the late 40s and early 50s.

[[File:Mahrez free kick 1 (16476351346).jpg|thumb|[[Algeria national football team|Algerian international]] [[Riyad Mahrez]] has often been deployed as a winger throughout his career.]]

The typical abilities of wingers include:
* Technical skill to beat a full-back in a one-to-one situation.
* Pace, to beat the full-back one-on-one.
* Crossing ability when out wide.
* Good off-the-ball ability when judging a pass from the midfield or from fellow attackers.
* Good passing ability and composure, to retain possession while in opposition territory.
* The modern winger should also be comfortable on either wing so as to adapt to quick tactical changes required by the coach.

Although wingers are a familiar part of football, the use of wingers is by no means universal. There are many successful football teams who operate without wingers. A famous example is [[Carlo Ancelotti]]'s late 2000s [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], who typically plays in a narrow midfield diamond formation or in a Christmas tree formation (4–3–2–1), relying on full-backs to provide the necessary width down the wings.

Left and right midfielders have a role balanced between attack and defence while they play a lot of crosses in the box for forwards. They are positioned closer to the [[Touch-line|touchlines]] of the [[Association football pitch|pitch]].

In Italian football, the role of the wide midfielder is known as ''tornante di centrocampo'' or simply ''tornante'' ("returning"); it originated from the role of an [[Forward (association football)#Outside forward|outside forward]], and came to be known as such as it often required players in this position to track back and assist the back-line with defensive duties, in addition to aiding the midfield and attacking.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/genoa-top-11-all-time.html |title=Genoa: Top 11 All Time |date=9 August 2017 |publisher=Storie di Calcio |language=it |access-date=21 May 2020 |archive-date=25 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210625220526/https://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/genoa-top-11-all-time.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://dizionari.repubblica.it/Italiano/T/tornante.html |title=tornante |work=La Repubblica |language=it |access-date=21 May 2020 |archive-date=3 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211103181548/https://dizionari.repubblica.it/Italiano/T/tornante.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Wing-half{{anchor|Wing_half}}===

The historic position of wing-half (not to be confused with ''mezzala'') was given to midfielders (half-backs) who played near the side of the pitch.

===Inverted winger and raumdeuter===
[[File:Rapinoe candlestick.jpg|thumb|USWNT midfielder [[Megan Rapinoe]] (left) has been deployed as an inverted winger throughout her career.]]

An inverted winger is a modern tactical development of the traditional winger position. Most wingers are assigned to either side of the field based on their [[footedness]], with right-footed players on the right and left-footed players on the left.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Barve|first1=Abhijeet|title=Football Jargon for dummies Part 2- Inverted Wingers|url=http://www.footballparadise.org/blog/inverted-wingers/|access-date=29 October 2015|publisher=Football Paradise|date=28 February 2013|archive-date=3 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003105301/http://www.footballparadise.org/blog/inverted-wingers/|url-status=dead}}</ref> This assumes that assigning a player to their natural side ensures a more powerful cross as well as greater ball protection along the [[touch-line]]s. However, when the position is inverted and a winger instead plays inside-out on the opposite flank (i.e., a right-footed player as a left inverted winger), they effectively become supporting strikers and primarily assume a role in the attack.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Johnathan|title=Inverting The Pyramid: The History of Soccer Tactics|date=2013|publisher=Nation Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1568587387|pages=373, 377}}</ref>

As opposed to traditionally pulling the opponent's [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-back]] out and down the flanks before crossing the ball in near the [[Football pitch#Pitch boundary|by-line]], positioning a winger on the opposite side of the field allows the player to cut-in around the [[Penalty area|18-yard box]], either threading passes between defenders or shooting on goal using the dominant foot.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Jonathan|title=The Question: Why are so many wingers playing on the 'wrong' wings?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/mar/24/the-question-inside-out-wingers|access-date=15 October 2015|work=The Guardian|date=24 March 2010|archive-date=26 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826015823/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/mar/24/the-question-inside-out-wingers|url-status=live}}</ref> This offensive tactic has found popularity in the modern game due to the fact that it gives traditional wingers increased mobility as playmakers and goalscorers,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Singh|first1=Amit|title=Positional Analysis: What Has Happened To All The Wingers?|url=http://www.just-football.com/2012/06/positional-analysis-what-has-happened-decline-of-traditional-wingers/|publisher=Just-Football.com|date=21 June 2012|access-date=8 April 2017|archive-date=4 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210304112144/https://www.just-football.com/2012/06/positional-analysis-what-has-happened-decline-of-traditional-wingers/|url-status=live}}</ref> such as the left-footed right winger [[Domenico Berardi]] of [[U.S. Sassuolo Calcio|Sassuolo]] who achieved 30 career goals faster than any player in the past half-century of [[Serie A|Serie A football]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Newman|first1=Blair|title=The young players who could rejuvenate Antonio Conte's Italy at Euro 2016|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/08/young-players-revive-antonio-conte-italy-euro-2016|access-date=29 October 2015|work=The Guardian|date=8 September 2015|archive-date=10 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910110642/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/08/young-players-revive-antonio-conte-italy-euro-2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Not only are inverted wingers able to push full-backs onto their weak sides, but they are also able to spread and force the other team to defend deeper as forwards and [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing-backs]] route towards the goal, ultimately creating more scoring opportunities.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Mike L.|title=How to Watch the World Cup Like a True Soccer Nerd|url=http://grantland.com/features/how-to-watch-the-world-cup-like-a-true-soccer-nerd/|access-date=15 October 2015|publisher=Grantland|date=6 June 2014|archive-date=24 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224181550/http://grantland.com/features/how-to-watch-the-world-cup-like-a-true-soccer-nerd/|url-status=live}}</ref>

This label has been used to describe an offensive-minded inverted winger, who will seemingly operate out wide on paper, but who instead will be given the freedom to make unmarked runs into more advanced central areas inside the penalty area to get on the end of passes and crosses and score goals, effectively functioning as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/real-madrid/86/blog/post/3418861/cristiano-ronaldo-evolving-into-an-effective-striker-for-real-madrid |title=Cristiano Ronaldo evolving into an effective striker for Real Madrid |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Dunne |first1=Robbie |date=14 March 2018 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=25 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210825222345/https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/real-madrid/86/blog/post/3418861/cristiano-ronaldo-evolving-into-an-effective-striker-for-real-madrid |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/ronaldo-vs-messi-case-ronaldo-worlds-greatest-player/ |title=Ronaldo vs. Messi: the case for Ronaldo as world's best player |publisher=Sportsnet |last1=MOLINARO |first1=JOHN |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=27 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627033937/https://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/ronaldo-vs-messi-case-ronaldo-worlds-greatest-player/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/125639/cristiano-ronaldos-rise-real-madrid |title=Cristiano Ronaldo's rise at Real Madrid |publisher=Football Italia |last1=Driscoll |first1=Jon |date=2 August 2018 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910110637/https://football-italia.net/125639/cristiano-ronaldos-rise-real-madrid |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.co.uk/football/club/real-madrid/86/blog/post/2824537/real-madrid-prepare-for-a-post-cristiano-ronaldo-era |title=Are Real Madrid ready for life without Cristiano Ronaldo? |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Goodman |first1=Mike |date=8 March 2016 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910110635/https://www.espn.co.uk/football/club/real-madrid/86/blog/post/2824537/real-madrid-prepare-for-a-post-cristiano-ronaldo-era |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/name/93/post/1839626/headline |title=Bale and Ronaldo comparisons not so ridiculous |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Laurence |first1=Martin |date=11 February 2013 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910112137/https://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/name/93/post/1839626/headline |url-status=live }}</ref> 

This role is somewhat comparable to what is known as the ''raumdeuter'' role in German football jargon (literally "space interpreter"), as exemplified by [[Thomas Müller]], as well as [[Dele Alli]] and [[Tim Cahill]], namely an attacking-minded wide player, who will move into effective central attacking areas to find spaces from which they can receive passes and score or assist goals, while other teammates create space for their runs by drawing opponents away from them.<ref name="FM1">{{cite news |url=https://medium.com/@v_maedhros/understanding-roles-in-football-manager-and-real-life-part-1-73054cfbb303 |author1=Tactics and Etc. |title=Understanding roles in Football Manager (and real life) (part 1) |work=Medium |date=13 May 2018 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=31 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731234408/https://medium.com/@v_maedhros/understanding-roles-in-football-manager-and-real-life-part-1-73054cfbb303 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/thomas-muller-the-most-under-appreciated-player-in-football-raumdeuter-bayern-munich-9945 |title=Thomas Müller: the most under-appreciated player in world football |publisher=Bundesliga |access-date=15 August 2021 |archive-date=2 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231002110923/https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/thomas-muller-the-most-under-appreciated-player-in-football-raumdeuter-bayern-munich-9945 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===False winger===
The "false winger" or "seven-and-a-half" is a label which has been used to describe a type of player who normally plays centrally, but who instead is deployed out wide on paper; during the course of a match, however, they will move inside and operate in the centre of the pitch to drag defenders out of position, congest the midfield and give their team a numerical advantage in this area, so that they can dominate possession in the middle of the pitch and create chances for the forwards; this position also leaves space for full-backs to make overlapping attacking runs up the flank. [[Samir Nasri]], who has been deployed in this role, once described it as that of a "non-axial playmaker".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/name/93/post/1839728/headline |title=Roberto Soldado perfectly anchors AVB's 'vertical' football |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Cox |first1=Michael |date=6 August 2013 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910110642/https://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/name/93/post/1839728/headline |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/english-premier-league/23/blog/post/2998241/manchester-united-must-play-paul-pogba-in-his-best-position-to-get-the-most-from-him |title=Man United must play Paul Pogba in best position to get the most from him |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Cox |first1=Michael |date=18 November 2016 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910122303/https://www.espn.com/soccer/english-premier-league/23/blog/post/2998241/manchester-united-must-play-paul-pogba-in-his-best-position-to-get-the-most-from-him |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/man-united-meet-henrikh-mkhitaryan-one-man-arsenal-wholl-give-your-attack-a-new-lease-life |title=Man United, meet Miki: The one-man arsenal who'll revitalise your attack |work=FourFourTwo |last1=Baldi |first1=Ryan |date=1 July 2016 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=1 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211201193521/https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/man-united-meet-henrikh-mkhitaryan-one-man-arsenal-wholl-give-your-attack-a-new-lease-life |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-england-liverpool-united/analysis-soccer-van-gaals-tactical-wits-edge-battle-of-the-bosses-idUKL3N0WN0AT20150322 |title=ANALYSIS-Soccer-Van Gaal's tactical wits edge battle of the bosses |work=Reuters |last1=Davis |first1=Toby |date=22 March 2015 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910110635/https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-england-liverpool-united/analysis-soccer-van-gaals-tactical-wits-edge-battle-of-the-bosses-idUKL3N0WN0AT20150322 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/long-read-guardiolas-16-point-blueprint-dominance-his-methods-management-and-tactics |title=The long read: Guardiola's 16-point blueprint for dominance - his methods, management and tactics |work=FourFourTwo |last1=Murray |first1=Andrew |date=16 August 2016 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910110635/https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/long-read-guardiolas-16-point-blueprint-dominance-his-methods-management-and-tactics |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@Discussion_Dave/julian-weigl-the-modern-day-regista-3586684bf2cc |title=Julian Weigl: The Modern Day Regista |work=Medium |last1=Ndiyo |first1=David |date=3 August 2017 |access-date=15 April 2020 |archive-date=26 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211026153726/https://medium.com/@Discussion_Dave/julian-weigl-the-modern-day-regista-3586684bf2cc |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2511694-the-tactical-evolution-of-arsenal-midfielder-santi-cazorla |title=The Tactical Evolution of Arsenal Midfielder Santi Cazorla |work=Bleacher Report |last1=McNicholas |first1=James |date=1 July 2015 |access-date=17 May 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910110641/https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2511694-the-tactical-evolution-of-arsenal-midfielder-santi-cazorla |url-status=live }}</ref>
