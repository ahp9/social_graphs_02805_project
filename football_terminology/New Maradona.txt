{{Diego Maradona series}}
'''New Maradona''' or '''New Diego''' was a title given by the press and public to promising [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[association football|football]] players in reference (and reverence) to [[Diego Maradona]] as a benchmark. Since Maradona retired, fans had been anticipating someone to lead the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]] to a [[List of FIFA World Cup finals|World Cup final]], like Maradona did in [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|1986]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup Final|1990]]. As a consequence, very talented youngsters were quickly labeled as the ''New Maradona'' (for example [[Lionel Messi]] or [[Juan Román Riquelme]]), sometimes without any similarity in playing style (such as [[Franco Di Santo]]). The ''New Maradonas'' were predominantly players in attacking or advanced playmaking roles — forwards, wingers, or attacking midfielders. The term gradually fell out of use after Lionel Messi successfully managed to lead Argentina to World Cup finals in [[2014 FIFA World Cup final|2014]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup final|2022]], winning it in the latter, arguably emulating and surpassing Maradona to become the most successful Argentine footballer ever.

=== Style of play similarities ===

Messi has been compared to Maradona due to their similar playing style, skill set, and short stature.<ref name="Daily"/> Their lower centre of gravity allows them to be more agile and change direction more quickly, helping them to evade tackles, and their short legs allow them to excel in short bursts of acceleration, and to keep control of the ball when dribbling at speed.<ref name="corriereil">{{cite web|title=Esplora il significato del termine: Controllo, corsa, tocco di palla Perché nel calcio piccolo è bello|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/aprile/08/Controllo_corsa_tocco_palla_Perche_co_9_100408088.shtml|website=Archiviostorico.corriere.it|access-date=25 July 2012|archive-date=21 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221031158/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/aprile/08/Controllo_corsa_tocco_palla_Perche_co_9_100408088.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref> Both players have played and worn the [[Squad number (association football)|number 10 shirt]] for [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and also for the Argentina national team, and like Maradona before him, Messi is also predominantly a left footed player.<ref>{{cite web|title=Diego Maradona believes Lionel Messi is better than Cristiano Ronaldo|url=http://www.givemefootball.com/european-news/maradona-messi-better-than-shampoo-commercial-rona|website=Givemefootball.com|access-date=25 July 2012|archive-date=26 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726001633/http://www.givemefootball.com/european-news/maradona-messi-better-than-shampoo-commercial-rona|url-status=live}}</ref> Messi's passing, dribbling, vision, eye for goal and [[Playmaker|playmaking]] ability have also drawn comparisons to Maradona.

=== Reception in Argentina ===
{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote="Messi has always lived in the shadow of Diego Maradona, the leader of our last World Cup-winning team in 1986. He could never escape the similarities. They are both No. 10s, both the best players in the world, both left footed and both capable of magical, extraordinary moments. And yet they were very different in terms of personality ... people were always looking for a leader like Maradona and Messi wasn't that person."|source=– compatriot [[Osvaldo Ardiles]] reflecting on the expectations that Messi faced in comparison to Maradona.<ref name="ArdilesMessi"/>}}
During the early and middle parts of his career, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona in Argentine society. Part of this had to do with Messi's lack of tournament success and perceived uneven output with the national team during this period – Maradona had famously led Argentina to victory in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] with a dominant overall performance, which set expectations for Messi to do the same.<ref name="laughable"/><ref name="adept"/><ref name="Burden" /> Also unlike Maradona, Messi never played in the [[Argentine Primera División]], therefore depriving his countrymen a chance to watch him develop and prove himself, and through no fault of his own would do this overseas in [[La Liga]] instead. <ref name="Here">{{Cite web |first=Wright |last=Thompson |title=Here and Gone: The Strange Relationship between Lionel Messi and His Hometown in Argentina |work=ESPN |date=22 October 2012 |url=http://www.espn.com/espn/eticket/story?page=Lionel-Messi |access-date=18 July 2015 |archive-date=25 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240225232901/http://www.espn.com/espn/eticket/story?page=lionel-messi |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Burden" /> His lack of outward passion for the ''Albiceleste'' shirt, early tendency not to sing the national anthem, and disinclination to emotional displays have in the past led to the false perception that he felt more Catalan rather than truly Argentine.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=414–420}}<ref name="Vickery" /> However, despite having lived in Barcelona since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing [[Spain national football team|Spain]] internationally, saying: "Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself.

Another factor for the Argentine preference for Maradona over Messi was the differences between the two in personality, class and background.
