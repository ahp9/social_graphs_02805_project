{{short description|Method of breaking ties in sports}}

The '''away goals rule''' is a method of [[tiebreaker|tiebreaking]] in [[association football]] and other sports when teams play each other twice, once at each team's home ground. Under the away goals rule, if the total goals scored by each team are equal, the team that has scored more goals "[[Road (sports)|away from home]]" wins the tiebreaker. This is sometimes expressed by saying that away goals "count double" in the event of a tie,<ref>For example: {{cite book|title=Laws of the Game 2007/2008 |chapter=Procedures to determine the winner of a match or home-and-away |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/federation/laws%5fof%5fthe%5fgame%5f0708%5f10565.pdf |author=IFAB |author-link=International Football Association Board |publisher=[[FIFA]] |location=[[Zürich]] |date=July 2007 |access-date=2008-07-08 |page=54 |quote='''Away Goals''': Competition rules may provide that where teams play each other home and away, if the scores are equal after the second match, any goals scored at the ground of the opposing team will count double. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625151118/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/federation/laws_of_the_game_0708_10565.pdf |archive-date=25 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> though in practice the team with more away goals is simply recorded as the victor, rather than having additional or 'double' goals added to their total.

The away goals rule is most often invoked in [[two-legged tie|two-leg fixtures]], where the initial result is determined by the [[aggregate score]] — i.e. the scores of both games are added together. In many competitions, the away goals rule is the first tie-breaker in such cases, with a [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] as the second tie-breaker if each team has scored the same number of away goals. Rules vary as to whether the away goals rule applies only to the end of normal time of the second leg, or applies in [[extra time (association football)|extra time]] as well. It was first introduced by [[UEFA]] in the [[1965–66 European Cup Winners' Cup]].

Since the early 2020s in [[association football]], the application of the away goals rule has been repeatedly scrutinized and ultimately abolished in numerous competitions. There is empirical evidence that the away goals rule reduces the total number of goals scored during the match and benefits visiting teams in the second leg due to the different perceptions of risk in the first leg and the second leg.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Varela-Quintana | first1 = C. | last2=del Corral | first2=J. | last3=Prieto-Rodriguez | first3=J. | year = 2018 | title = Order Effect Under the "Away-Goals Rule:" Evidence from CONMEBOL Competitions | journal = International Journal of Sport Finance | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 82–102 | doi = 10.1177/155862351801300105 | hdl = 10651/47265 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323685830| hdl-access = free }}</ref> There are two other commonly cited reasons for the abandonment of the rule.

== Explanation ==

'''Example 1:'''

* In the first leg, the final score is: Team A (Home) 1–0 Team B (Away).
* In the second leg, the final score is: Team B (Home) 1–0 Team A (Away).

In this example, the aggregate score is 1–1, but as neither team scored an away goal, the match will progress to the next tie-breaker, [[extra time (association football)|extra time]].

'''Example 2:'''

* In the first leg, the final score is: Team A (Home) 0–0 Team B (Away).
* In the second leg, the final score is: Team B (Home) 2–2 Team A (Away).

In this example, the aggregate score is 2–2. However, because Team A scored an away goal in the second leg while Team B, in the first leg, did not, Team A will progress to the next stage of the competition as they scored more away goals than Team B.

'''Example 3:'''

In the first leg, the final score is:
* ''First leg:'' Team A (Home) 1–0 Team B (Away).

In the second leg, the final score goes as follows:

* ''Second leg, after 90 minutes:'' Team B (Home) 1–0 Team A (Away).
* ''Second leg, after extra time:'' Team B (Home) 2–1 Team A (Away).

In this example, the aggregate score is 1–1 after 90 minutes in the second leg and neither team has scored an away goal, the match goes into extra time. The score remains level 2–2 on aggregate after extra time. However, Team A has now scored an away goal and competition rules count away goals after extra time, Team A will thus progress to the next stage of the competition, as they scored more away goals than Team B.

'''Example 4:'''

In the first leg, the final score is:

* ''First leg:'' Team A (Home) 1–0 Team B (Away).

In the second leg, the final score goes as follows:

* ''Second leg, after 90 minutes:'' Team B (Home) 1–0 Team A (Away).
* ''Second leg, after extra time:'' Team B (Home) 2–1 Team A (Away).
In this example, the aggregate score is 1–1 after 90 minutes in the second leg and neither team has scored an away goal, the match goes into extra time. After extra time, the scores remain level 2–2 on aggregate, and Team A has now scored an away goal. However, unlike in example 3, the competition rules don't count the away goals in extra time, and the match will progress to a penalty shootout.

'''Example 5:'''

In the first leg, the final score is:

* ''First leg:'' Team A (Home) 1–0 Team B (Away).

In the second leg, the final score goes as follows:

* ''Second leg, after 90 minutes:'' Team B (Home) 1–0 Team A (Away).
* ''Second leg, after extra time:'' Team B (Home) 1–0 Team A (Away).

In this example, the aggregate score is 1–1, but as neither team scored an away goal, the match will progress to the next tie-breaker, [[extra time (association football)|extra time]]. Since no further goals are scored there, the match will progress to a penalty shootout.

'''Example 6:'''

* ''First leg:'' Team A (Home) 0–1 Team B (Away).
* ''Second leg:'' Team B (Home) 1–2 Team A (Away).

In this example, the aggregate score is 2–2. However, because Team A has scored more away goals than Team B, Team A will progress to the next stage of the competition.

== Rationale ==

Originally, the away goal rule was introduced in football as an expedited way of doing away with playoffs or tie breakers on neutral grounds to resolve a logistical, physical and calendar problem when two teams were so closely matched the final score over the two legs remained in absolute parity, which could remain even after a third game tie breaker. The away goals rule is intended to encourage the away team to be more aggressive. In football, at least, it can lead to a nervous first leg: the home team is unwilling to commit large numbers of players to attack to avoid conceding an away goal, whilst the away team attempts to snatch an away goal to aid them in the second leg. Such tactics arguably make the second leg more exciting, after a low-scoring first leg leaves both sides with a chance to win. There are sometimes debates over whether the away goals rule gives an unfair advantage to the team playing away first — with the other team squandering their home advantage in the first leg due to away goal fears — and this may be a factor in its somewhat patchy adoption for competitions.<ref name="UEFA">{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/news-media/news/026a-1298aeb73a7a-5b64cb68d920-1000--abolition-of-the-away-goals-rule-in-all-uefa-club-competitions/|title=Abolition of the away goals rule in all UEFA club competitions|website=[[UEFA]]|date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624132025/https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/mediaservices/mediareleases/news/026a-1298aeb73a7a-5b64cb68d920-1000--abolition-of-the-away-goals-rule-in-all-uefa-club-competitions/|archive-date=24 June 2021|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="skysports.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12340830/away-goals-rule-abolished-for-uefa-competitions-from-2021-22-season|title=Away goals rule abolished for UEFA competitions from 2021-22 season|website=skysports.com|date=24 June 2021}}</ref>

The rule can also make the game more exciting as normally one goal can only make the difference between losing and drawing, or between drawing and winning, but with the away goals rule, one goal can make the difference between losing and winning.

There is also the issue that if extra time is played in the second leg, the away team gets an extra 30 minutes to take advantage of the away goals rule. This can be countered by the fact that in extra time, the home team has the advantage of playing the extra 30 minutes at home. In addition, usually, the home team had made a better campaign in the group stage, which would naturally give it some advantage over the away team.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that most teams feel an away goal puts them in the driving seat, such as [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] being able to draw 1–1 at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League]] quarterfinals; Liverpool did eliminate Arsenal to advance to the semi-finals.<ref>For example, after a 1–1 draw away from home: {{cite news| url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7323943.stm | title= Reds away goal delights Benitez |location=[[Liverpool]] |access-date=2008-04-18 |publisher=BBC |quote= We are in a good position ...

Liverpool won the second game 4–2, making the aggregate score for the tie Liverpool 5–3 Arsenal, therefore, the away goal scored by Liverpool in the first leg was not required.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7332209.stm|title=Liverpool 4-2 Arsenal (agg 5-3)|date=8 April 2008|website=news.bbc.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409122524/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7332209.stm|archive-date=9 April 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>
Many commentators have described the importance of a team being able to score an away goal, even when losing that leg of the tie, as it mathematically does give that team a chance to redeem itself on home soil by leveling the tie on aggregate while using the away goal as a tiebreaker.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kevin McCarra at the Bernabeu Stadium |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/apr/09/championsleague.sport |title=Real Madrid 3 - 1 Manchester United &#124; Soccer |work=The Guardian |date=2003-04-09 |access-date=2013-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020121020/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/apr/09/championsleague.sport |archive-date=2013-10-20 |url-status=live }}</ref> For example, in the 2007 UEFA Champions League round of 16, while Bayern Munich lost the first leg 2–3 at Real Madrid, Bayern later won 2–1 at home to level the tie on aggregate, but it was Bayern's away goals scored during their first leg loss that let them advance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6414969.stm |title=BBC SPORT &#124; Soccer &#124; Europe &#124; Bayern M 2-1 R Madrid (agg 4-4) |work=BBC News |date=2007-03-07 |access-date=2013-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309132649/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6414969.stm |archive-date=2007-03-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League]], Bayern Munich won both round of 16 and quarter-finals on the away goal rule after drawing 4–4 on aggregate, by winning 2–1 at home and losing 2–3 away, against [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] respectively.<ref>{{cite web |author=Phil McNulty |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8604742.stm |title=Man Utd 3 – 2 Bayern Munich (agg 4–4) |website=BBC Sport |date=7 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407054633/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8604742.stm |archive-date=7 April 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League]] semi-finals, despite losing 1–4 in the first leg to [[Borussia Dortmund]], [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] would have been able to advance if at home it managed to hold Dortmund to 3–0; during the second leg Real Madrid scored two goals in the last ten minutes but were unable to score the third goal that would have sent them through to the final (Dortmund advanced 4–3 on aggregate). In the other semi-final, however, after [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] were defeated away by Bayern Munich 4–0, commentators considered Barcelona essentially eliminated because Bayern could seal the tie by scoring one away goal even if Barcelona managed to score five goals (Bayern managed a 3–0 win in the second leg to advance 7–0 on aggregate).<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter Shard |url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/sport/soccer/2013/04/29/dortmund-bayern-resist-the-pitfalls-of-complacency |title=Dortmund, Bayern resist the pitfalls of complacency &#124; Soccer |publisher=BDlive |date=2013-04-29 |access-date=2013-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525042210/http://www.bdlive.co.za/sport/soccer/2013/04/29/dortmund-bayern-resist-the-pitfalls-of-complacency |archive-date=2013-05-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The away goals rule can result in the "lead" of the two-legged tie swinging back and forth. For instance, in the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League]] round of 16 between Barcelona and Chelsea, Barcelona were ahead on aggregate after a 2–1 win in the first leg at home. During the second leg held in London, Chelsea first scored three straight goals to take the lead on aggregate (4–2), but Barcelona responded with two goals to level the aggregate score at 4–4 while taking the lead on away goals (2–1). Chelsea scored again, though, to advance on aggregate, 5–4.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4321491.stm |title=BBC SPORT &#124; Soccer &#124; Europe &#124; Chelsea 4-2 Barcelona |work=BBC News |date=2005-03-08 |access-date=2013-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060413094745/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4321491.stm |archive-date=2006-04-13 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the [[2018–19 UEFA Champions League]] semi-finals between [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], Ajax led the tie from the 15th minute of the first leg (in a 1–0 away victory in London) until the 95th minute of the second leg (at that point still up 3–2 on aggregate), when Tottenham's [[Lucas Moura]] completed a hat-trick in Amsterdam that leveled the aggregate score at 3–3 while eliminating Ajax, 3–1, on away goals.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Taylor |title=Tottenham comeback stuns Ajax and sets up final against Liverpool |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/08/ajax-tottenham-champions-league-semi-final-match-report-moura |work=The Guardian |date=8 May 2019 |access-date=10 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508224153/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/08/ajax-tottenham-champions-league-semi-final-match-report-moura |archive-date=8 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Neil |last=Johnston |title=Ajax 2–3 Tottenham |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/48192369 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 May 2019 |access-date=10 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509022911/https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/48192369 |archive-date=9 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Rory |date=8 May 2019 |title=A Dream Delivered, and Another Dashed, in One Unforgettable Moment |page=B9 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/sports/ajax-tottenham-champions-league.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=10 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509093748/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/sports/ajax-tottenham-champions-league.html |archive-date=9 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Usage ==
The away goals rule was applied in many football competitions that involved two-leg fixtures, including the knockout stages of the [[CAF Champions League]], [[CAF Confederation Cup]], and any two-legged playoffs in qualification for the [[FIFA World Cup]] or [[UEFA European Championship|European Championships]].

From 2014 until 2018, [[Major League Soccer]] in the U.S. and Canada used the away goals rule in the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]], in which the conference semi-finals and finals (the quarterfinals and semi-finals of the overall tournament) were two-legged.<ref name="MLS">{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/03/07/major-league-soccer-introduce-away-goals-rule-first-time-2014-mls-cup-playof |title=Major League Soccer to introduce away-goals rule for first time in 2014 MLS Cup Playoffs |publisher=Major League Soccer |date=2014-03-08 |access-date=2014-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311051053/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/03/07/major-league-soccer-introduce-away-goals-rule-first-time-2014-mls-cup-playof |archive-date=2014-03-11 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The rule was first applied in this competition when [[Seattle Sounders FC]] defeated [[FC Dallas]] in the 2014 Western Conference semi-finals. In the [[2019 Major League Soccer season|2019 MLS season]], two-legged ties were eliminated in favour of a single-elimination knockout format throughout the entire playoffs.<ref>{{cite web |title=MLS announces new playoff format for 2019 season |url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/12/13/2019-mls-playoff-structure |publisher=Major League Soccer |access-date=2019-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181218054617/https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/12/13/2019-mls-playoff-structure |archive-date=2018-12-18 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the [[Liga MX]], the away goals rule always applied to the playoff games until the 2020–21 season. This was also applied to the final games until the 1995–96 season where [[Necaxa]] beat [[Celaya F.C.]] In those games, Necaxa was able to pull a 1–1 tie in the game in Celaya, then the team was able to hold a 0–0 tie in [[Azteca Stadium]] to win the championship. After that final, the away goals rule was removed from the final game and in case of a tie after the two games, it went to extra time and a penalty shootout if needed, as happened in the Invierno 1999 season where [[Atlas F.C.]] and [[Deportivo Toluca]] were tied 5–5 (3-3 and 2-2) at the end of the second game (that would give Toluca the championship by away goals) but it went to extra time and a penalty shootout where Toluca beat Atlas 5–3 to win the championship.

In [[CONMEBOL]] competitions before 2005, for example the [[Copa Libertadores de América|Copa Libertadores]], neither away goals rule nor extra time were used. Ties that were level on aggregate went to an immediate penalty shootout. From 2005 until 2021, two-legged ties were decided on points, followed by goal difference and the away goals rule; if the result was still tied, the penalty shootout was used. The finals became the only exception to the away goals and extra time. In Latin America, an example of a tournament that used the away goal rule was the [[Copa do Brasil]] (Brazil Cup) until the 2017 edition.

The [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] semi-finals, when previously played over two legs, would apply the away goals rule only after extra time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.givemesport.com/1698902-jamie-carragher-slams-uefas-decision-to-scrap-away-goals-rule-in-european-football|title=Jamie Carragher slams UEFA's decision to scrap away goals rule in European football|publisher=givemesport.com|date=28 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602213336/https://www.givemesport.com/1698902-jamie-carragher-slams-uefas-decision-to-scrap-away-goals-rule-in-european-football|archive-date=2 June 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 24 June 2021, UEFA approved the proposal to abolish the away goals rule in all club competitions from the 2021–22 season.<ref name="UEFA" /><ref name="skysports.com" /> After that, AFC followed the suit starting from the 2023–24 season.

== Anomalies ==
If the two clubs contesting a two-legged fixture share the same stadium, each club may be the home club in one leg, and the rule may still apply. For example, the [[UEFA Champions League 2002-03|2003 UEFA Champions League]] semi-finals drew [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]] and [[AC Milan]] together. Both legs were played at the [[San Siro]], their shared stadium in [[Milan]]:

* ''First leg:'' AC Milan 0–0 Inter Milan
* ''Second leg:'' Inter Milan 1–1 AC Milan

With an aggregate of 1–1, AC Milan was declared the winner because they were the "away" side in the second game. In this example, as in many such cases, most tickets for each leg will be reserved for the "home" side's fans, so the designation was not totally arbitrary.

Not all competitions with the away goals rule suffer from this anomaly, however: the [[Copa do Brasil]] has developed its rules to avoid some anomalies, such as the above. In that Cup, if two teams share either the same stadium or the same home town, neither is considered the home club and thus the away goals rule does not apply. This exception was seen, for example, in the 2006 final between [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]] and [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco]], when both legs were played at the [[Maracanã Stadium]].

More anomalous was a qualification play-off for the [[1991 FIFA World Youth Championship|1991 World Youth Championship]] between [[Australia national under-20 association football team|Australia]] and Israel:<!-- Israel U-20 doesn't have an article yet. --> Australia won on away goals even though, due to security concerns arising from the [[First Intifada]], Israel's "home" leg was played in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rsssf.org/tableso/oc-u20-90.html |title=Oceania U-20 World Cup 1991 Qualifiers |date=2002-08-10 |access-date=2013-10-18 |url-status=live |website=[[RSSSF]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019071610/http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/oc-u20-90.html |archive-date=2013-10-19 }}</ref> The same situation occurred in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] qualification tie between the [[Bahamas national football team|Bahamas]] and the [[British Virgin Islands national football team|British Virgin Islands]], when the Bahamas advanced on the away goals rule even though both legs were played in the Bahamas.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=727130.html#bermuda+bahamas+march |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402044450/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=727130.html#bermuda+bahamas+march |archive-date=2008-04-02 |url-status=dead |title=Bermuda and Bahamas march on |website=FIFA.com}}</ref>

There has been at least one case of a wrong application of the away goals rule by a referee in an international club tournament. It happened in a second-round tie in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1971-72|1971–72 European Cup Winners' Cup]] between [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]]. This fixture had the following scorelines:

* ''First leg:'' Rangers 3–2 Sporting
* ''Second leg, after 90 minutes:'' Sporting 3–2 Rangers
* ''Second leg, after extra time:'' Sporting 4–3 Rangers

Since the teams were now level 6–6 on aggregate, the Dutch referee Laurens van Raavens ordered a penalty shootout, which Sporting won 3–0. Rangers appealed the loss, however, because Van Raavens should not have ordered the shootout, since the Rangers goal in extra time in [[Lisbon]] gave them a lead of three away goals to two. Rangers won the appeal and went on to win the Cup Winners' Cup that season.

[[CONCACAF]] used a different rule for its [[CONCACAF Champions League]], employing away goals at the end of regulation of the second leg but not applying the rule at the end of extra time. It has since abolished extra time in that tournament with penalty kicks used if teams are even on goals and away goals after both legs. MLS adopted this version of the rule for its playoffs in 2014.<ref name="MLS" /> For example, the [[CONCACAF Champions League 2008–09 championship round#Semifinals|semifinal]] of the [[CONCACAF Champions League 2008–09|2008–09 CONCACAF Champions League]] between [[Cruz Azul]] and the [[Puerto Rico Islanders]] had the following scorelines:

* ''First leg:'' Puerto Rico Islanders 2–0 Cruz Azul
* ''Second leg, after 90 minutes:'' Cruz Azul 2–0 Puerto Rico Islanders
* ''Second leg, after extra time:'' Cruz Azul 3–1 Puerto Rico Islanders

Since CONCACAF does not apply the away goals rule for goals scored in extra time, the game went to a penalty shootout, which Cruz Azul won 4–2.

A similar situation occurred in the [[2018 MLS Cup Playoffs]], in the second leg of [[Seattle Sounders FC]] vs [[Portland Timbers]]. After both legs went 2–1, for a 3–3 aggregate (with equal away goals) after regulation time, the game went to extra time. In extra time, both teams scored. At the end of extra time, the away team, Timbers, began to celebrate, assuming their away goal in extra time would break the tie; but the tournament did not apply the away goals rule to extra time goals, leading to a penalty shootout (which Timbers won 4–2).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/sports/soccer/timbers-sounders-away-goals.html|title=A Whistle, a Celebration and Then a Reminder About the Rules|work=[[New York Times]]|last=Mather|first=Victor|date=2018-11-09|accessdate=2022-12-07}}</ref>

The away goals rule can also apply to forfeited matches. [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] lost their away tie to [[Legia Warsaw]] 4–1 in the [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round|2014–15 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round]]. In their home leg, Legia brought on an ineligible player which automatically gave Celtic a 3–0 win. The forfeiture meant that the tie ended 4–4, meaning Celtic qualified to the next round, 1–0, on away goals.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/28753686 | title=Celtic: Legia Warsaw's Champions League appeal bid fails|access-date=29 August 2015 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | date=14 August 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815015629/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28753686 | archive-date=15 August 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>

The away goals rule can also apply to matches played [[behind closed doors (sport)|behind closed doors]]. For the [[2019–20 UEFA Champions League|2019–20]] and [[2020–21 UEFA Champions League|2020–21]] editions of the UEFA Champions League, although the away goals rule remained in place for these seasons, home advantage was nullified as a result of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] having no home fans for support (empty stadiums) and even being forced to relocate their "home" to alternate venues, leading to UEFA deciding to abolish the away goals rule.<ref name="UEFA" /><ref name="skysports.com" /> Both legs of the [[2020–21 UEFA Champions League]] round of 16 contest between [[FC Porto|Porto]] and [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] were played without fans in attendance due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=A guide to the Champions League round of 16|url=https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2021/02/a-guide-to-the-champions-league-round-of-16|access-date=2021-04-08|website=The Johns Hopkins News-Letter|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210226175258/https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2021/02/a-guide-to-the-champions-league-round-of-16|archive-date=2021-02-26|url-status=live}}</ref> Porto won the first leg 2–1 at home and trailed the second leg by the same score after regulation.
