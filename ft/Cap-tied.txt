'''Cap-tied''' is an adjective, used primarily in [[association football]], to describe a player who has represented a senior national football team in more than three games (including at least one competitive game) and as a result is unable to represent another FIFA-affiliated national team. The term is a play on "[[cup-tied]]", which refers to a player who is not eligible to appear in a cup competition for a new team after having appeared for another team earlier in the season.

In general, a player is "cap-tied" once they have played in an official competition for the senior national team.<ref>{{cite web|title=FIFA Statutes (August 2014)|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/02/41/81/55/fifastatuten2014_e_neutral.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817125313/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/02/41/81/55/fifastatuten2014_e_neutral.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 17, 2014|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=12 August 2014|date=August 2014}}</ref>

A player who was only eligible to play for one nation at the time of their first competitive appearance, no matter the level, is cap-tied to that nation. For example, [[Adama Traoré (footballer, born 1990)|Adama Traoré]], an [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] youth international, had shown interest in playing for the [[Australia men's national soccer team|Socceroos]] after having moved to Australia; however, in October 2013, the FFA released a statement saying that he was ineligible for Australia because of his prior appearances.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adama Traore confirmed ineligible for Socceroos |url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/283909,adama-traore-confirmed-ineligible-for-socceroos.aspx |publisher=FourFourTwo |accessdate=22 October 2013 |date=3 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014010736/http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/283909%2Cadama-traore-confirmed-ineligible-for-socceroos.aspx |archivedate=14 October 2013 }}</ref>

If a player was eligible to play for multiple nations prior to making a competitive appearance, they are cap-tied to a nation after playing more than three matches for one national team, including at least one competitive appearance (if the player is under 21 at the time, no matter the level of competition, as long as they have not played in the finals of a major tournament), or after making a competitive appearance (if the player is over 21 at the time and the appearance is for the senior team). Allowing young players to play a couple games before becoming cap-tied was a change to the rules announced during the 2020 [[FIFA]] congress, with the hope to prevent "one-cap wonders"; it was seen as an opportunity for some dual-national players, like Spanish-Moroccan [[Munir El Haddadi]], who were called up as promising players for European nations, but not afforded more than one or two caps, to elevate the level of their African heritage nations.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Price |first=Steve |title=FIFA Eligibility Rule Change Offers World Cup Hopes For 'One-Cap Wonders' |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveprice/2020/09/19/fifa-eligibility-rule-change-offers-world-cup-hopes-for-one-cap-wonders/ |access-date=2022-12-28 |website=Forbes |language=en}}</ref>

Playing only in friendly competitions at any level does not cap-tie a player. A player who competes for one nation in a friendly match is not considered cap-tied and may represent another nation in a competitive fixture, should the opportunity present itself. An example of this is [[Jermaine Jones]], who had played three friendlies for [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in 2008 but started competing for the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] in 2010.

In some instances, players have [[Asylum seeker|sought refuge]] in another country after having represented their national team in an official competition. Players such as [[Maykel Galindo]], [[Lester Moré]], and [[Osvaldo Alonso]] represented [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]] and are unable to represent either Cuba or another nation.

Before football was regulated, some players did represent multiple teams internationally. In the 21st century, Spanish players may represent their [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] (or [[Menorca football team|Menorca]]) in friendly matches while playing for the [[Spain national football team|Spain national team]]; the only way players can represent multiple nations at a senior competitive level is British players representing their national team ([[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]], or [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] of the United Kingdom, or the [[British Overseas Territories]] of [[Anguilla national football team|Anguilla]], [[Montserrat national football team|Montserrat]], or the [[Turks and Caicos Islands national football team|Turks and Caicos Islands]]) and [[Great Britain Olympic football team|Great Britain at the Olympics]].
