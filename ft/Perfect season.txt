A '''perfect season''' is a sports [[season (sports)|season]], including any requisite [[playoffs|playoff]] portion, in which a team remains and finishes undefeated (and typically, untied). The feat is extremely rare at the professional level of any team sport but has occurred more commonly at the collegiate and scholastic levels in the [[United States]]. A '''perfect regular season''' (known by other names outside the United States) is a season ''excluding'' any playoffs, where a team remains undefeated; it is less rare than a complete perfect season but still exceptional.

[[Exhibition games]] are generally not counted toward standings, for or against. For example, the [[1972 Miami Dolphins]] lost three of [[NFL preseason|preseason exhibition games]] but are considered to have had a perfect season.

== Basketball ==
No [[National Basketball Association]] team has ever had a perfect season. {{As of|2025}}, the [[2015–16 Golden State Warriors season|2015–16 Golden State Warriors]] have the best ever regular-season record in the NBA, with a record of 73–9, breaking the [[1995–96 Chicago Bulls season|1995–96 Chicago Bulls]] record of 72–10. However, the Warriors lost the [[2016 NBA Finals]] to the [[2015–16 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/16342407/golden-state-warriors-complete-historic-collapse-game-7 |title=Season full of history ends in misery for Golden State |work=ESPN.com |date=June 20, 2016 |access-date=August 4, 2024}}</ref>

Two NBA teams have had nearly perfect regular seasons at their home arenas:
* The [[1985–86 NBA season|1985–86]] [[1985–86 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] finished with a 40–1 (.976) record at the [[Boston Garden]]. The Celtics' only home loss occurred on December 6, 1985 to [[1985–86 Portland Trail Blazers season|the Portland Trail Blazers]] by the score of 121–103. The Celtics also won all 10 of their home games in the postseason to finish 50–1 at home. 
* The [[2015–16 NBA season|2015–16]] [[2015–16 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]] also finished with a 40–1 (.976) at [[Frost Bank Center|AT&T Center]]. The Spurs' only regular-season home loss occurred on April 10, 2016 to the [[Golden State Warriors]] by the score of 92–86. In the [[2016 NBA playoffs|playoffs]], however, the Spurs were 3-2 at home, losing twice to the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in the conference semifinals to finish 43-3 (.935) at home.

Basketball leagues outside the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] tend to have fewer games per season, thus making a perfect season more achievable:

==Cricket==
===County cricket===
English [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[county cricket]] has existed as the top tier of domestic cricket in England since the middle nineteenth century, and until the 1950s, it was up to the highest standard of the game. Seasons have varied in length: before the 1880s, they were generally less than ten matches in length and some "first-class" counties played only against one or two different opponents. Between [[1887 English cricket season|1887]] and [[1929 English cricket season|1929]], seasons were gradually increased in length to a standard twenty-eight matches for all counties. However, because of the development and popularity of one-day cricket, seasons have been reduced to twenty-four games in [[1969 English cricket season|1969]] and twenty in [[1972 English cricket season|1972]], though this was increased by two in [[1977 English cricket season|1977]] and [[1983 English cricket season|1983]]. With an increase to four days for all games, sixteen or seventeen games have been played since [[1993 English cricket season|1993]].

Also, because of improvements to pitches via the [[heavy roller]] and covering to protect from rain, the proportion of games "drawn" (not finished) has steadily risen since the 1870s.

Since tables of results have been kept in [[1864 English cricket season|1864]],<ref name="rigby">Wynne-Thomas, Peter; ''The Rigby A-Z of Cricket Records''; pp. 53 to 67. {{ISBN|072701868X}}</ref> the only team to have competed a true perfect season—winning outright every game—was [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] in [[1867 English cricket season|1867]] when led by [[George Freeman (cricketer)|George Freeman]]'s and [[Tom Emmett]]'s deadly fast bowling on uncovered and unrolled pitches,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1867_f_Bowling_by_Average.html |title=First-Class bowling for Yorkshire in 1867 |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |access-date=January 23, 2013 |archive-date=December 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217052822/http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1867_f_Bowling_by_Average.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> they won all seven county games.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/1867_f.html |title=Yorkshire 1867 season summary |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |access-date=January 23, 2013 |archive-date=December 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217053039/http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/1867_f.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Since 1868 numerous county teams in longer schedules have finished a season unbeaten,<ref name="rigby"/> but none have managed to win every single game outright:

==American football==
===Pre-NFL era and competing leagues===
Predecessors to the [[National Football League]] such as the [[Ohio League]], [[New York Pro Football League]] and [[Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit]] had many perfect seasons:
* In western Pennsylvania, the [[1900 Homestead Library & Athletic Club football team|1900]] and [[1901 Homestead Library & Athletic Club football team|1901]] Homestead Library and Athletic Club teams and the 1903 [[Franklin Athletic Club]] had perfect seasons.
* In Ohio, the [[Massillon Tigers]] (1904, 1905), [[Akron Indians]] (1909), [[Shelby Blues]] (1911), and [[Dayton Triangles]] (1918) all had perfect seasons during this era. 
* In 1918, the [[Buffalo (NFL)|Buffalo Niagaras]] went 5–0–0 (6–0–0 including a forfeit) in 1918, in a league that consisted of teams entirely from the city of Buffalo in 1918. 
* In 1920, the [[Union Club of Phoenixville]] played in a league consisting mostly of local teams and earned a perfect season, claiming for itself a [[mythical national championship]].

The caliber of talent in these leagues was neither high nor consistent, the seasons were generally shorter than in the modern NFL, and it was common for top teams to play all their games at home while lesser teams played all of their games on the road. In 1918, for example, Dayton and Buffalo had the additional advantage of having its strongest competitors suspend operations due to the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]] and the [[World War I|First World War]], restrictions that also prevented the two teams from playing each other. Thus, it was much easier to earn a perfect season than it would become in the NFL.

====1937 Los Angeles Bulldogs====
{{Main|Los Angeles Bulldogs}}
In 1937, the [[Los Angeles Bulldogs]] joined the [[American Football League (1936)|second American Football League]] after the [[Cleveland Rams]] defected to the NFL. Playing a combination of AFL teams and independent franchises (such as the [[Providence Steam Roller]] and the [[Salinas Packers (football)|Salinas Packers]]), the team went 16–0, with 8 wins coming against AFL teams. The Pro Football Hall of Fame cites the Bulldogs’ dominance as one of the key factors in the AFL's demise,<ref>{{Cite web | title=1937 {{!}} Pro Football Hall of Fame Official Site | url=https://www.profootballhof.com/football-history/football-history/1869-1939/1937/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220127142354/https://www.profootballhof.com/football-history/football-history/1869-1939/1937/ | access-date=2025-08-25 | archive-date=2022-01-27}}</ref> and as an independent team the next season, the Bulldogs finished with a 10–2–2 record, including a 2–1–2 record against NFL teams. Several of the team's players were invited to play on the "Pro All Stars" team in the NFL's first [[Pro Bowl|Pro All-Star Game]] in Los Angeles, and the Bulldogs are considered to be one of the few independent teams to have ever achieved parity with the NFL.

====1948 Cleveland Browns====
{{Main|1948 Cleveland Browns season}}

In 1948, the [[Cleveland Browns]] of the [[All-America Football Conference]] won all fourteen regular season games and the [[All-America Football Conference#1948|AAFC championship]] to finish the season with a 14–0–0 record. Cleveland's perfect 1948 season was part of a string of 29 straight wins from 1947 to 1949, including both the 1947 and 1948 title games. On April 1, 2025, the NFL voted to recognize AAFC statistics, awarding the 1948 Browns full recognition of a perfect season.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-04-01 |title=Tom Brady championship mark tied, Bill Belichick title wins surpassed as NFL adds new twist to record book |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-brady-championship-mark-tied-bill-belichick-title-wins-surpassed-as-nfl-adds-new-twist-to-record-book/ |access-date=2025-04-03 |website=CBSSports.com |language=en}}</ref>

Since the [[National Football League]] began in [[1920 NFL season|1920]], only one team has played a perfect season: the [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins]], who won all fourteen of their regular season games and three postseason games, including [[Super Bowl VII]], to finish the season 17–0–0.

It has often been reported that the surviving members of the 1972 Dolphins would, every season when the final undefeated team earned its first loss of the year, either gather to drink champagne or send a case of champagne to the team who beat this final undefeated team. [[Don Shula]], the head coach of the 1972 Dolphins, denied this in a 2007 interview with ESPN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wojciechowski|first=Gene|title=Shoes ...

On August 20, 2013, four decades after their accomplishment, President [[Barack Obama]] hosted the 1972 Dolphins noting that they "never got their [[White House]] visit".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nfl.com/news/president-obama-honors-1972-miami-dolphins-at-white-house-0ap1000000232205|title=President Obama honors 1972 Miami Dolphins at White House|date=August 20, 2013|accessdate=January 30, 2023|work=NFL.com}}</ref>

===Near perfect seasons===
====Undefeated seasons (with ties) before introduction of playoffs====
Until the development of a playoff system in the NFL in [[1932 NFL season|1932]], there were four teams who completed seasons undefeated with one or more tied games: [[1920 Akron Pros season|the 1920 Akron Pros]], [[1922 Canton Bulldogs season|the 1922 Canton Bulldogs]], [[1923 Canton Bulldogs season|the 1923 Canton Bulldogs]], and [[1929 Green Bay Packers season|the 1929 Green Bay Packers]]. According to the 2012 NFL Record & Fact Book, under NFL practices from 1920 to 1971, tie games were not included in winning percentage, giving these four teams perfect winning percentages of 1.000.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/History/Past_Standings_2011.pdf | title=2012 NFL Record & Fact Book | publisher=NFL | access-date=September 18, 2013 | pages=393 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215190035/http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/History/Past_Standings_2011.pdf | archive-date=December 15, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[1921 Buffalo All-Americans season|The 1921 Buffalo All-Americans]] were controversially denied an undefeated season because they believed that their final game, [[Staley Swindle|a 10–7 loss to the Chicago Staleys]], was an exhibition game which would not count in the final standings. The NFL recorded that game as official and Buffalo's record as 9–1–2.

====NFL perfect regular seasons====
Apart from the 1972 Dolphins, three NFL teams have completed undefeated and untied regular seasons: [[1934 Chicago Bears season|the 1934 Chicago Bears]], [[1942 Chicago Bears season|the 1942 Chicago Bears]], and [[2007 New England Patriots season|the 2007 New England Patriots]]. Each lost in the playoffs:
* In 1934, the Bears played a 13–0–0 regular season and became the first NFL team to complete an unbeaten and untied regular season but lost the [[1934 NFL Championship Game]] against [[1934 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]].
* Despite losing several players and head coach [[George Halas]] to military service in World War II, the 1942 Bears finished the regular season 11–0–0 but lost the [[1942 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]] to [[1942 Washington Redskins season|the Washington Redskins]].
* The 2007 Patriots were the first and only team to finish the regular season undefeated under the 16-game schedule used from [[1978 NFL season|1978]] to [[2020 NFL season|2020]]. The Patriots won the divisional and conference playoff games but were upset in [[Super Bowl XLII]] by [[2007 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]] in [[Helmet Catch|dramatic fashion]], giving them a final record of 18–1.

Most of these teams suffered their only regular-season loss early in the season. Only the 1962 Packers (10–0), 1985 Bears (12–0), 2011 Packers (13–0), and 2015 Panthers (14–0) were on track for a perfect season when they lost. Coincidentally, the 1985 Bears’ lone loss came to the Miami Dolphins.

The best start from an NFL team who failed to complete a perfect regular season is shared by two teams: the [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|2009 Indianapolis Colts]], who started 14–0 before losing their final two regular season games to the [[2009 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] and the [[2009 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] to finish 14–2, and the [[2015 Carolina Panthers season|2015 Carolina Panthers]], who went 14–0 before losing to the [[2015 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] and going on to finish the regular season 15–1. The 2009 Colts, having clinched the top seed in the AFC, sacrificed their chances at a perfect regular season and instead [[resting the starters|rested their starters]] the final two games to protect them for the playoffs, on orders from then General Manager Bill Polian. The Colts faced immense criticism from their players, their fans, and the media for letting their chances of a perfect season slip away. The Colts would go on to [[Super Bowl XLIV]] but lost to the [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]. The 2015 Panthers were not resting their starters at the time of their loss (at the time, the [[2015 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] were 13–2 and still had an opportunity to surpass the Panthers for the top seed in the NFC).

Four other teams have started 13–0 before losing in their fourteenth game: the [[1998 Denver Broncos season|1998 Denver Broncos]], [[2005 Indianapolis Colts season|2005 Indianapolis Colts]], [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009 New Orleans Saints]] and [[2011 Green Bay Packers season|2011 Green Bay Packers]] (Of those near-perfect seasons, the 2005 Colts and the 2011 Packers did not win a single playoff game). The 1998 Broncos, 2005 Colts and 2009 Saints lost at least two of their final three games but the Broncos and Saints recovered to win the Super Bowl. The [[1953 Cleveland Browns season|1953 Cleveland Browns]] and [[1969 Los Angeles Rams season|1969 Los Angeles Rams]] started 11–0 in twelve- and fourteen-game seasons respectively; both lost their only playoff game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballgeography.com/?p=3190|title=Last Undefeated NFL Team(s) in Each Season » FootballGeography.com|website=www.footballgeography.com|access-date=February 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117230829/http://www.footballgeography.com/?p=3190|archive-date=January 17, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Other leagues===
The following is a list of teams in minor or alternate leagues that compiled perfect seasons of six games or more, including postseason games, with no ties:

*The Hollywood Bears, a member of the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]], went 8–0–0 in 1941.
*The Hollywood Rangers were a member of the [[American Football League (1944)|American Football League of 1944]] (formerly the Northwest War Industries League), a short-lived competitor to the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]] on the West Coast. In their 1944 season, they went 11–0–0 and defeated the PCPFL champion San Diego Bombers (who had also had a perfect season in their league, going 9–0–0) in a two-game series.
*The Charleston Rockets of the [[Continental Football League]] won all 14 games of the league's inaugural season in 1965, going on to defeat the [[Toronto Rifles]] in the league's championship.
*The [[Hartford Knights]] went 17–0–0 in 1972 as a member of the [[Seaboard Football League]], including a victory over the [[Chambersburg Cardinals]] in the league's championship. The Knights, unhappy with the level of competition (many of the Knights games had margins of victory of 40 points or more), quit the league the following year.

In [[indoor American football|indoor football]], the following teams have had perfect seasons:

*The [[Quad City Steamwheelers]] went undefeated in the [[2000 AF2 season|inaugural season]] of [[AF2|arenafootball2]], accruing a record of 19–0–0 including playoffs and an [[ArenaCup I]] win.
*The [[Ohio Valley Greyhounds]] of the [[National Indoor Football League]] accrued a perfect season in 2003.
*The [[Sioux Falls Storm]] of [[United Indoor Football]] won back-to-back perfect seasons in 2006 and 2007, winning the United Bowl championship both years.
*The [[Fayetteville Guard]] won a perfect season in 2007 in the NIFL.
*The [[Rochester Raiders]] won a perfect season in [[2008 Continental Indoor Football League season|2008]] in the [[Continental Indoor Football League]], but withdrew from that league during the playoffs in a dispute.
*The [[Chicago Slaughter]] won a perfect season in [[2009 Continental Indoor Football League season|2009]] in the CIFL.
*The [[Baltimore Mariners]] won a perfect season in [[2010 American Indoor Football Association season|2010]] in the [[American Indoor Football Association]].
*The [[Erie Explosion]] won a perfect season in [[2013 Erie Explosion season|2013]] in the Continental Indoor Football league, winning all ten regular season games, a semifinal playoff, and the CIFL Championship.
*The [[Omaha Beef]] won a perfect season in 2023 in the CIF and again in 2024 in the NAL. The Beef's two-year winning streak would be broken in 2025 with a surprise loss to the semi-pro Minneapolis Warriors at the start of the 2025 season.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sottile |first=Matt |date=2025-03-03 |title=Omaha Beef lose season opener in dramatic fashion |url=https://www.ketv.com/article/omaha-beef-lose-season-opener/64006649 |access-date=2025-03-03 |website=KETV |language=en}}</ref>
*The [[Columbus Lions]] won all games in the 2023 AIFA season and the 2024 AIF season.

At least twenty-three other semi-professional football teams have had perfect seasons, seven of them being at least 17 games long. The [[Chambersburg Cardinals]] won a record 72 straight games between 1977 and 1984.<ref>Steven Brainerd (2010). [http://www.semiprofootball.org/minor/records/teamgame.htm Minor league football records – Winning streaks].</ref>

There were no perfect seasons (or even perfect regular seasons) in the [[American Association (football)|American Association]], [[World Football League]], either incarnation of the [[United States Football League]], the original [[XFL (2001)|XFL]], any of the three incarnations of the [[Arena Football League]] or the [[Alliance of American Football]], all of which are now defunct. The 2009-2012 incarnation of the [[United Football League (2009–2012)|United Football League]] had two perfect regular seasons, but neither qualify for the list: [[2009 Florida Tuskers season|the 2009 Florida Tuskers]] finished 6–0, but that team lost the subsequent [[2009 UFL Championship Game|championship game]]; the [[2012 Las Vegas Locomotives season|2012 Las Vegas Locomotives]] had a record of 4–0 when the league abruptly suspended operations halfway through the season. Likewise, the [[2020 Houston Roughnecks season|2020 Houston Roughnecks]] of the [[XFL (2020)|second incarnation of the XFL]] were undefeated at 5–0 at the time the season was canceled due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]].

The 1933 [[Providence Huskies]] (possibly a successor to the [[Providence Steam Roller]]) played arguably the most perfect season ever recorded by a professional or semi-professional team: a ten-game season in which they won every game and did not concede a single point during any game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.semiprofootball.org/minor/records/teampnts.htm |title=Semi-pro Football / Minor League Football – Team Points Records |publisher=Semiprofootball.org |access-date=January 23, 2013}}</ref>

===Leagues outside North America===
In the [[2014 German Football League]] the [[Braunschweig Lions]] compiled a perfect season (12–0 postseason 3–0), losing only in the [[BIG6 European Football League]] which is a different competition. They crowned the season with another German Bowl triumph. Similarly in the [[2016 German Football League]] the [[Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns]] achieved a perfect regular season with a 14–0 record, similarly their lone defeat came in the [[BIG6 European Football League]] which is not considered for league standings. However, unlike Braunschweig before them, Schwäbisch Hall ultimately lost the [[German Bowl]], in this case to Braunschweig. In the [[2017 German Football League]] season, Schwäbisch Hall once more compiled a perfect season (14–0) but this time also won the [[German Bowl]], again against Braunschweig. Interestingly, their opponent in the final had also entered the game with a 14–0 regular season record. Overall the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns posted five consecutive perfect regular seasons (GFL games only) between 2016 and 2021 (both inclusive) — their only losses in that span coming in [[German Bowl XXXVIII]] (2016), [[German Bowl XLI]] (2019), and [[German Bowl XLII]] (2021).

In [[2023 European League of Football season|2023]] [[Rhein Fire (ELF)|Rhein Fire]] managed a perfect season in the [[European League of Football]] with 12 wins in the regular season and 2 wins in the playoffs including the final of the league.

==Association football==

===Domestic teams===
{{see also|List of unbeaten football club seasons}}
No [[association football]] team has ever achieved a perfect season across all competitions entered, but some have achieved a perfect record in their respective domestic league competitions, although that feat itself is rare. The earliest known perfect league season is that of [[Rangers F.C.]] of Scotland who, in [[1898–99 Rangers F.C. season|1898–99]], won all of their 18 [[Scottish League Division One]] matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scottishfootballmuseum.org.uk/the-season-of-1898-99/|title=The Season of 1898–99|author=Stuart Spencer|date=January 16, 2019|publisher=[[Scottish Football Museum]]|access-date=March 24, 2020|archive-date=April 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418184414/https://scottishfootballmuseum.org.uk/the-season-of-1898-99/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[https://rangers.co.uk/club/history/rangers-history/the-beginning-of-glory/ The beginning of glory], Rangers FC</ref><ref>[https://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSA00544 Rangers Team, 1898–99 (Mitchell Library, Glasgow Collection)], The Glasgow Story</ref><ref>[https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/18995617.amp/ The first great Rangers team whose 'perfect season' remains unique in British football 122 years on], Matthew Lindsay, Glasgow Times, January 7, 2021</ref> Other football clubs to have achieved perfect league seasons since then are: [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]] of Argentina in 1919 (13 wins out of 13), [[Al-Arabi SC (Kuwait)|Al-Arabi]] of Kuwait in 1961–62 (12 wins out of 12), [[Ferencvárosi TC|Ferencvárosi]] of Hungary in 1931–32 (22 wins out of 22), [[Dresdner SC]] of Germany in 1942–43 (23), [[Sunrise Flacq United]] of [[Mauritius]] in 1995–96 (22), and [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]] of [[Uruguay]] in 1941 (20).<ref name="rsssf">{{cite web|url=https://www.rsssf.org/miscellaneous/unbeaten.html |title=Unbeaten |publisher=Rsssf.com |access-date=January 23, 2013}}</ref> [[FC Bayern Munich]] managed a 11–0–0 perfect record en route to winning the [[2019–20 UEFA Champions League]], the first team to do so. The competition's format was reformulated in a single elimination match since the quarterfinals due to [[COVID-19 pandemic in Europe]] and its following [[lockdown]].

Many teams have achieved an unbeaten domestic season with zero losses, but with several draws.

In women's football, English club [[Arsenal W.F.C.|Arsenal]] won the [[2006–07 FA Women's Premier League]] with a perfect record (22–0–0) in [[List of Arsenal W.F.C. seasons#Seasons|their 2006–07 season]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=England (Women) 2006/07 |url=https://www.rsssf.org/tablese/eng-wom07.html |access-date=May 1, 2024 |website=www.rsssf.org}}</ref> alongside the FA Cup, Premier League Cup, Community Shield, London FA Cup,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-12-22 |title=Teams with single-season trophy hauls |url=https://www.espn.com.au/football/story/_/id/37488723/barcelona-arsenal-ladies-santos-lead-teams-single-season-trophy-hauls |access-date=2024-07-28 |website=ESPN.com |language=en}}</ref> and UEFA Women's Cup, with their only draw a goalless one in the second leg of the UEFA Women's Cup final, an unprecedented feat.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kessel |first=Anna |date=May 4, 2008 |title=The invincibles |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/04/sportfeatures.gender |access-date=May 1, 2024 |work=The Observer |language=en-GB |issn=0029-7712}}</ref> Italian club [[Juventus F.C.

===FIFA World Cup===

The likelihood of a national team in the [[FIFA World Cup]] winning all its matches in regulation time to become the champion is much higher than most clubs in their domestic league, as the finals tournament in its current format lasts only seven games. This feat has been achieved three times, by [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in the inaugural [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]] tournament, and by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]. This is not counting the [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying round]] of the tournament, which lasts over a year and has had a varied format since [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]. Only the Brazilian team of 1970 has won every game in the qualification and final rounds of a single tournament, a total of 13 games.<ref>{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20070608000507/http://fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=32/results/index.html FIFA.com]}}</ref><ref>{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20071121130014/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=32/preliminaries/preliminary=28/index.html FIFA.com]}}</ref> As there was no qualifying phase for the 1930 tournament, Uruguay also won all the games they played to become champions. In 2010, the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] came very close, achieving the same feat as Brazil did in 1970. The Netherlands won 8 out of 8 qualifying games and went on to win the next 6 [[FIFA World Cup 2010|World Cup]] matches in regulation time only to lose in [[overtime (sports)|extra time]] to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the final, ending with a 14–0–1 record.

===FIFA Women's World Cup===
Through [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup|2011]], the likelihood of a national team winning all of its matches in the [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] was slightly greater than in the men's version. The Women's World Cup began in [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1991]] with 12 teams and expanded to 16 effective in [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999]]. Under both structures, the winning team only had to win six games (three in group play and three in the knockout stage) to win the title unbeaten. The tournament expanded to 24 teams in [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup|2015]], at which time the number of games that the champion must play increased to seven (the same total as in the men's World Cup).

The 2011 event, won by [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]], was the first in which the champion lost in group play; the other finalist, the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States]], had also lost in group play. Each previous team to have won the title — the United States in 1991 and 1999, [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]] in [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup|1995]], and [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]] in [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup|2003]] and [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup|2007]] — won all of its group stage matches. In fact, only one of these teams, the United States in 1999, had a knockout match go to extra time—specifically the final against [[China women's national football team|China]], which ultimately went to a [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Germany won all of its matches in the 2007 final tournament without giving up a goal, becoming the first team in either the men's or women's World Cup to accomplish this feat. The United States' third championship team in 2015 had one draw in the group stage; in [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup|2019]], the United States won all seven games in regulation, by a combined score of 26–3, en route to their fourth title.

As of the 2019 tournament, four undefeated, untied Women's World Cup champions also went through their qualifying stage without a loss or draw:
* United States, 1991 ([[1991 CONCACAF Women's Championship|5 wins, 49 goals for, 0 against]])
* Germany, 2003 ([[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|6 wins, 30 goals for, 1 against]])
* Germany, 2007 ([[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|8 wins, 31 goals for, 3 against]])
* United States, 2019 ([[2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship|5 wins, 26 goals for, 0 against]])

Of the other two teams to win the Women's World Cup without a loss or draw in the finals:
* Norway went through their 1995 qualification campaign with 8 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss.
* The United States automatically qualified for the 1999 edition as hosts.

==Australian rules football==

===Australian Football League (AFL)===
The [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) began in 1897 as the Victorian Football League (VFL); initially based entirely in the state of Victoria, it expanded through the 1980s and 1990s to become the highest-level national competition in the sport of Australian rules football. The length of a complete season (including finals matches) has typically been between 18 and 26 games. Throughout the history of the league, no team has ever completed a perfect season. One team, {{AFL Col}} in [[1929 VFL season|1929]], completed a perfect home-and-away season, finishing with a record of 18–0; the club won the premiership, but did not complete a perfect season after losing the [[Second amended Argus system|second semi-final]] against {{AFL Ric}}.

===South Australian National Football League (SANFL)===
{{main|1914 Port Adelaide Football Club season}}

The SANFL has existed since 1877 within South Australia. The only perfect season to be completed was by the 1914 [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] team, known as the "Invincibles". Port won all four of its pre season matches. It finished the minor round with a 12–0 record, before winning both finals to finish with a 14–0 record and a perfect season. They also won the Championship of Australia against VFL premiers [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], to extend that record to 15–0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianfootball.com/clubs/stats/Port+Adelaide+Magpies/318/1914|first=John|last=Devaney|publisher=Australian Football|title=Port Adelaide Magpies 1914 results|access-date=June 28, 2012}}</ref> In addition to this the club played a combined team from all the other SAFL clubs and won to extend the record to 16–0. The closest any team got to Port Adelaide was [[North Adelaide Football Club|North Adelaide]], losing by 21 points in Round 10. This is the only instance in the big three Australian football leagues (VFL/SANFL/WAFL) where a club has gone undefeated in the pre-season, season main and post season.

In 1912, Port Adelaide had a perfect minor round and then beat [[West Torrens Football Club|West Torrens]] in its semi-final but lost both the final and Grand Final to [[West Adelaide Football Club|West Adelaide]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianfootball.com/clubs/stats/Port+Adelaide+Magpies/318/1912|first=John|last=Devaney|publisher=Australian Football|title=Port Adelaide Magpies 1912 results|access-date=June 28, 2012}}</ref>

===West Australian Football League (WAFL)===
The [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]] has existed since 1885 within Western Australia. The [[1946 WANFL season|1946]] [[East Fremantle Football Club|East Fremantle]] team was the first club in senior WAFL football{{efn| In the [[1944 WANFL season|1944 under-19 wartime competition]] that replaced the senior competition between [[1942 WANFL season|1942]] and that season due to the player drain of World War II, [[East Perth Football Club|East Perth]] managed a perfect season, winning all nineteen home-and-away games plus two finals.}} to have managed a perfect season, winning all twenty-one of its games; it is noted that the playing lists of many of its opponents had been seriously depleted by World War II.<ref>Devaney, John; ''Full Points Footy's WA Football Companion''; pp. 69–70. {{ISBN|9780955689710}}</ref> The only loss for the season came against Victorian club Collingwood in a post season exhibition match. The [[2018 WAFL season|2018]] [[Subiaco Football Club|Subiaco]] team was the second team to complete a perfect season, winning all of its 18 games in the minor round before winning both their second-semi-final against [[South Fremantle Football Club|South Fremantle]] and the Grand Final against [[West Perth Football Club|West Perth.]]

===Victorian Football League (VFL)===
The Victorian Football League, known until 1996 as the Victorian Football Association, began in 1877 and was Victoria's premier football league until 1897, and has been the second-tier league in the state since. Perfect seasons have been completed on five occasions in VFA/VFL history, but only twice in full-length seasons:
#by [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] during a war-shortened [[1915 VFA season|1915]], with a record of 15–0
#by North Melbourne in [[1918 VFA season|1918]], which was also shortened by the war, with a record of 12–0;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianfootball.com/clubs/bio/North+Melbourne/13 |title=North Melbourne Football Club |publisher=Australianfootball.com |access-date=January 23, 2013}}</ref>

There were also cases of teams going undefeated through the season in the nineteenth century, but none completed perfect seasons because some of their matches were drawn. Of those, {{AFL Gee}} could be interpreted as having been perfect in [[1879 VFA season|1879]]; it had a record of 15–0–1, and the draw came by agreement when a match which Geelong led 1–0 was abandoned due to inclement weather.<ref name="review1">{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|date=October 18, 1879|title=The Football Season of 1879 – Part 1|author=Peter Pindar|publication-place=Melbourne|page=493|issue=707|volume=XXVII}}</ref>

Four other teams have completed perfect home-and-away seasons, but subsequently lost finals matches:<ref>Fiddian, Marc; ''The VFA: a history of the Victoria Football Association 1877–1995''; pp. 226–299. Published 2004 by On-Demand Pty Ltd.</ref>

# Williamstown in [[1957 VFA season|1957]] won all twenty home-and-away games before losing to [[Moorabbin Football Club|Moorabbin]] in the second semi final, and being eliminated by Port Melbourne in the preliminary final.

==Canadian football==
A true perfect season (no losses and no ties through the regular season and playoffs) has never been achieved in the modern era of professional Canadian football. Only one team, the 1948 [[Calgary Stampeders]] (in the pre-CFL era), has completed a perfect regular season; more on this can be seen below.

The current [[Canadian Football League]] schedule in place since 1986 would require a team to win 20 games (18 regular season, 1 playoff after bye week, and the Grey Cup championship) to post a perfect record; the closest any team has come to such since the CFL's establishment in 1958 are the 1981 [[Edmonton Eskimos]], who went 14–1–1 in the regular season, en route to winning their fourth of five straight Grey Cup titles by winning both their playoff games, and the closest since the institution of the 18-game schedule coming in 1989, also set by the Edmonton Eskimos, by going 16–2 in the regular season, only to be upset by the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] in the West Final.

===1948 Calgary Stampeders===
Under head coach [[Les Lear]], the 1948 [[Calgary Stampeders]] completed a perfect regular season with a record of 12–0; they had two wins and a tie during the playoffs to finish with a record of 14–0–1, the only undefeated complete season in Canadian pro history.<ref>[https://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&id=208] Grey Cup History (CFL.ca), Accessed December 13, 2007</ref> In the [[Western Interprovincial Football Union]] championship (a home-and-home [[Playoff format#Total points series (aggregate)|aggregate]] series decided on total points) against the [[Regina Roughriders]], the first leg was tied 4–4, and the Stampeders won the second 21–10, to win the aggregate 25–14. The Stampeders then defeated the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] 12–7 for the [[36th Grey Cup]].

Despite the Stampeders' title, their achievement was only lightly regarded in the East. At the time, the Eastern and Western unions played separate regular seasons and met only in the Grey Cup. The Western union was openly regarded to be a weaker competition than the East, and Calgary's win (only the third for a Western team up to that time) was dismissed as a fluke.

==Handball==
In 2020–21 [[FC Barcelona Handbol]] had over all championships a perfect season. They won the following domestic championships: [[Liga ASOBAL]] with 34 perfect games, the [[Copa del Rey de Balonmano]], [[Copa ASOBAL]] and the [[Supercopa ASOBAL]]. At the European level they won the [[2020–21 EHF Champions League]] with 20 perfect games. In total they won 61 games out of 61 in 2020–21.<ref>{{Cite web|date=June 13, 2021|title=Handball – Barça crowns perfect season with Champions League victory – sport|url=https://www.archysport.com/2021/06/handball-barca-crowns-perfect-season-with-champions-league-victory-sport/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210614065138/https://www.archysport.com/2021/06/handball-barca-crowns-perfect-season-with-champions-league-victory-sport/|archive-date=June 14, 2021|access-date=June 14, 2021|website=Archysport}}</ref>

===Germany===
In 2011–12, German handball champion [[THW Kiel]] achieved a perfect season of as many as 34 matches. Additionally, the team also won the national DHB Cup and the international [[EHF Champions League]].<ref>[http://www.toyota-handball-bundesliga.de/handball/tabelle.php?liga=1&menuid=215&topmenu=214 Toyota Handball Bundesliga – final table] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609080844/http://www.toyota-handball-bundesliga.de/handball/tabelle.php?liga=1&menuid=215&topmenu=214 |date=June 9, 2012 }}</ref>

===Spain===
In the [[Liga ASOBAL]] the [[FC Barcelona Handbol]] had 4 consecutive perfect seasons from the [[Liga ASOBAL 2013–14|2013–14]] season to the [[Liga ASOBAL 2016–17|2016–17]] season.

===Croatia===
In the [[Croatian Handball Premier League]]  the [[RK Zagreb]] was unbeaten for 11 years, they won 190 consecutive games, last time they lost against [[Osijek Motormodul]] (38:39) on April 14, 2007. In that 190 games they just have one tie with [[RK Poreč]] (31:31), after that game they won 178 games in a row.<ref>{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20080812031321/http://sport.hrt.hr/htvsport/rukomet/06_07/m_IIdio.html]}}

==Lacrosse==
In professional [[lacrosse]], the [[1993 MILL season|1993]] [[Buffalo Bandits]] are the only team to have won a perfect season in the [[National Lacrosse League]]. The Bandits won all eight of their regular season games and won the championship in a two-round tournament; the season was the continuation of a multi-season winning streak that dated to the Bandits’ successful run for the [[1992 MILL season|previous year]]'s championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.buffalonews.com/sports_ink/2011/07/three-former-bandits-among-six-nominated-for-nll-hall.html |title=Three former Bandits among six nominated for NLL Hall – Sports, Ink &#124; The Buffalo News |publisher=Blogs.buffalonews.com |date=July 7, 2011 |access-date=January 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220032729/http://blogs.buffalonews.com/sports_ink/2011/07/three-former-bandits-among-six-nominated-for-nll-hall.html|archive-date=February 20, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In [[Major League Lacrosse]], which began play in 2001, [[2013 Denver Outlaws season|the 2013 Denver Outlaws]] were the first team to complete a perfect regular season, winning all fourteen of their games.<ref>[http://www.denverpost.com/lacrosse/ci_23837209/denver-outlaws-beat-hamilton-finish-season-undefeated-at ‘Denver Outlaws beat Hamilton, finish season undefeated at 14–0’]; ''[[Denver Post]]'', August 10, 2013</ref> After beating [[2013 Hamilton Nationals season|the Hamilton Nationals]], the Outlaws had a sequence of twenty consecutive regular season wins despite losing [[2012 MLL season|the 2012 championship]]. However, the Outlaws lost in the first round of the playoffs [[2013 Charlotte Hounds season|to the Charlotte Hounds]], who had only gone 7–7 in the regular season.

==Netball==

===Commonwealth Bank Trophy===
The Commonwealth Bank Trophy was the main national netball competition in Australia from 1997 to 2007. There were eight teams in a double round robin format and finals.

The [[Sydney Swifts]] were the only team to achieve a perfect season, winning all fourteen regular season games and both their finals matches for a record of 16–0.

===ANZ Championship===
The ANZ Championship, the principal netball competition for Australia and New Zealand was established in 2008 to replace the Commonwealth Bank Trophy. Comprising ten teams (five from Australia and five from New Zealand) there has so far been one perfect season, by the Mission [[Queensland Firebirds]], based in [[Brisbane, Queensland]] in 2011. The Firebirds won thirteen regular season games and both their finals matches for a record of 15–0. In 2010, the New South Wales Swifts managed to win all thirteen regular season games, but lost both of their finals matches and ended with a 13–2 for that year.

=== Netball Superleague ===
The [[Netball Superleague]], the principal netball competition in the United Kingdom following its founding in 2005, has seen three invincible seasons in its history. [[Team Bath (netball)|Team Bath]] finished both the [[2006–07 Netball Superleague season|2006–07]] and [[2008–09 Netball Superleague season|2008–09]] seasons unbeaten, going 14–0 and 16–0 respectively in the regular season before winning the grand final.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Team Bath defend their Super League Title |url=https://womensportreport.com/team-bath-defend-their-super/wn/40 |access-date=April 23, 2024 |website=Women's Sport - Women's sport news |language=EN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=April 6, 2009 |title=TeamBath win Superleague grand final |url=https://www.express.co.uk/netball/93640/TeamBath-win-Superleague-grand-final |access-date=April 23, 2024 |website=Express.co.uk |language=en}}</ref> The most recent team to achieve this feat was [[Manchester Thunder]] in the [[2022 Netball Superleague season|2022 season]], who went 20–0 in the regular season before seeing off Team Bath and [[Loughborough Lightning (netball)|Loughborough Lightning]] in the playoffs.

==Rugby league==

===National Rugby League===
The [[National Rugby League]] has existed since 1908, being originally known as the New South Wales Rugby League and before the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] war of 1995 as the Australian Rugby League. In its history, only one team has completed a perfect season: the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] in [[1925 NSWRFL season|1925]], who won all twelve games contested.<ref>{{cite web|title=Season 1925|publisher=Rugby League Tables|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1925.html|access-date=June 3, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417012749/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1925.html|archive-date=April 17, 2011}}</ref>

===Brisbane Rugby League===
The [[Brisbane Rugby League premiership]] began in 1909 and continued in varying forms until 1996, after which it was superseded by the [[Queensland Cup]]. Between the 1930s and the 1960s it was of comparable standard to the New South Wales Rugby Football League, but subsequently a huge drain of players to Sydney eroded the standard of play. Before [[World War II]] seasons were typically no more than twelve games long; however as the competition grew it was expanded to 21 games by 1960. The only BRL teams to manage a perfect season were:

===British Rugby League===
Whilst no rugby league team in Britain has completed the perfect season in the top flight, this has been achieved on four occasions in lower divisions; twice in the 2nd division and twice in the 3rd. [[Hull F.C.]] achieved this feat in the [[1978–79 Northern Rugby Football League season|1978–79 Season]], where they won 26 from 26 games, gaining promotion to the top division for the second time in three seasons. This was also achieved by the [[Dewsbury Rams]] in [[2009 Championship 1|2009]] during their [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship 1]] (third division) season where they won all 18 games from a possible 18, winning promotion immediately after being relegated the previous season where they won just two games. Since their 2009 promotion, the Rams have so far stayed in the sports' second division, including two play off finishes. The third occasion came in 2021 when [[Toulouse Olympique]] finished the [[2021 RFL Championship|2021 Championship]] with a 100% record having won 13 games and awarded a 14th as a walkover. The season was badly affected by postponements and cancellations caused by restrictions imposed under COVID-19 regulations and Toulouse only managed to play 13 games (all away) while all the other teams in the division played 20 to 22 games.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gordon |first1=James |title=The Invincibles: Perfect seasons in rugby league |url=https://www.loverugbyleague.com/post/invincibles-perfect-seasons-rugby-league/ |access-date=December 2, 2022 |work=Love Rugby League |date=December 2, 2022}}</ref>

The fourth occasion was in 2022 when [[Keighley Cougars]] won all 20 games in taking the [[2022 RFL League 1|League 1]] title.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cougars register a full house |work=[[Rugby Leaguer & League Express]] |page=28 |date=September 5, 2022 |issue=3343}}</ref>

In [[2017 League 1|2017]], the [[Toronto Wolfpack]] completed the regular reason with a perfect 15–0 record, however after the [[2017 League 1 results#Super 8s|Super 8s]] they finished with a 20–1–1 record. They lost in the Challenge Cup against the Salford Red Devils.

==Rugby union==

===International Rugby===
The [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand All Blacks]] were the first professional rugby team to produce a perfect rugby test season in 2013. They successfully defeated {{nrut|France}} four times, {{nrut|Australia}} three times, {{nrut|South Africa}} and {{nrut|Argentina}} twice and also beat {{nrut|Japan}}, {{nrut|England}} and {{nrut|Ireland}} in their incredible winning run. They produced a record of 14–0–0, defeating the top 5 ranked teams below them in the IRB world rankings. {{nrut|England}} have matched this feat after producing a perfect test season in 2016 (winning all 13 matches) after recovering from getting knocked out of their own [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] in [[2015 Rugby World Cup|2015]].

The [[France national rugby union team|French]] recorded a perfect season in 2022 having won all 13 matches.<ref>{{cite web |title=France record perfect season |url=https://rugby365.com/countries/france/france-record-perfect-season/ |publisher=Rugby 365 |access-date=August 9, 2023}}</ref>

===Super Rugby===
The Southern Hemisphere's principal team competition, [[Super Rugby]], established as Super 12 in 1996 and later known as Super 14 before adopting its current name in 2011, has seen only one perfect season. The [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]], based in [[Christchurch]] and representing a large portion of the [[South Island]] of New Zealand, finished the [[2002 Super 12 season]] with an 11–0–0 record and went on to win both of their finals matches to claim the season crown unbeaten.

One other team has won a championship unbeaten: in [[1997 Super 12 season|1997]], the [[Blues (Super Rugby)|Auckland Blues]] (known simply as "Blues" since 2000), which at the time represented the central and southern parts of the [[Auckland]] area plus some adjacent regions to the south, finished the regular season with one draw from 11 matches. They also won both of their finals matches to claim the title.

==Tennis (team)==
In 2011 and 2012, the [[Washington Kastles]] of [[World Team Tennis]] completed back-to-back perfect seasons, the first pro sports franchise in the United States to do so. The Kastles swept each of the 2011 and 2012 regular seasons with a perfect 14–0 record, then in each season went on to win their two postseason games and league's championship, amassing a 32-game winning streak in the process. This streak stands one short of the all-time professional sports record in the United States by [[1971–72 Los Angeles Lakers season|the 1971–72 Los Angeles Lakers]].

==Volleyball==
In the 2012–13 Season, [[Vakıfbank Spor Kulübü|Vakıfbank İstanbul]] won all 52 games and reached five championship trophies<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tvf.org.tr/img/uploads/arsiv/2012-2013/2012-2013_Genel_Fikstur_web.xls |website=[[Turkish Volleyball Federation]] |title=Genel Fikstür |year=2012 |language=tr |access-date=January 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192342/http://www.tvf.org.tr/img/uploads/arsiv/2012-2013/2012-2013_Genel_Fikstur_web.xls |archive-date=January 2, 2014 }}</ref> in

In addition, they won all 51 games they played in year 2013. Having started Turkish Women's Volleyball League's 2013–14 Season with 13 wins and [[2013–14 CEV Women's Champions League]] with 8 wins, they extended their winning streak to 73 games as of January 23, 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.fanatik.com.tr/vakifbank-73-yapti-ceyrek-finale-kaldi_3_Detail_29_352567.htm |website=[[Fanatik (Turkey)|Fanatik]] |title=Vakıfbank 73 yaptı çeyrek finale kaldı |date=January 23, 2014 |language=tr |access-date=January 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129024458/http://www.fanatik.com.tr/vakifbank-73-yapti-ceyrek-finale-kaldi_3_Detail_29_352567.htm |archive-date=January 29, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Other North American professional sports leagues==
In North America's two other major professional sports leagues ([[Major League Baseball]] and the [[National Hockey League]]), due to the fact there are a large number of games (82 in the NBA and NHL, and 162 in Major League Baseball), it is practically impossible for a team to finish with a perfect season. The [[Women's National Basketball Association]]'s season has been between 28 and 40 games long, and it too has never produced a perfect season.

It is possible for a baseball [[pitcher]] to achieve a perfect season, taking at least one win and any number of no-decisions throughout the year. This has happened 1,813 times in baseball's history, though the majority (1,171) were 1–0 seasons, mostly by [[relief pitcher]]s. The best perfect season belongs to [[Tom Zachary]] of the 1929 [[New York Yankees]], who posted a 12–0 record in 119.2 innings. No pitcher has ever achieved a perfect season while qualifying for the [[Earned run average|ERA]] title.

In the NHL, the [[1976–77 NHL season|1976–77]] [[Montreal Canadiens]] played nearly a perfect home season. They went 39–1 (.975) at home, their lone loss coming on October 30, 1976, against the [[Boston Bruins]]. The Canadiens only lost 8 games all year, finishing with a 60–8–12 record.

==Individual professional sports ==
For other sports leagues for individuals, such as the [[PGA Tour]] or [[Formula One]], a perfect season would represent winning every event in a season. Considering the number of tournaments or races in those leagues, and the fact that each individual faces over 40 opponents as opposed to one, a perfect season is almost impossible.

===Auto racing===
In [[Formula One]], prior to 1991, a driver could only count a certain number of their best results towards the championship, meaning it was possible to score 100 percent of the maximum championship points without winning every race in the season. This was accomplished by [[Alberto Ascari]] in 1952 and twice by [[Jim Clark]] in 1963 and 1965, both of his championship seasons. The record for the highest percentage of wins in a season was held by Ascari for his 1952 effort in which he won 6 out of 8 (75.00%) races on the calendar. This feat was surpassed by Max Verstappen in the 2023 season with 19 wins out of 22 races (86.36%) in the calendar.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/sports/autoracing/f1-red-bull-max-verstappen-2023.html For Red Bull and Max Verstappen, 2023 Was a Dominant Year] [[The New York Times]]</ref>

In 1988, the McLaren team won 15 of the 16 Grands Prix held that year. The only race victory that eluded them was the Italian Grand Prix, where their driver Ayrton Senna was eliminated after a collision in the closing stages whilst leading the race.

[[Colin McRae]] won every round of the 1992 [[British Rally Championship]], driving a [[Subaru Legacy]] for the [[Prodrive]] team.<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0053/index.shtml |title= A Sporting Nation – Colin McRare's first World Rally title 1995 |work= [[BBC Scotland]] |last= Low |first= Dave |date= c. 1999 |access-date= August 10, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/december-1992/4/month-motor-sport |title= The month in Motor Sport |work= [[Motor Sport magazine]] |date= December 1992 |access-date= August 10, 2021}}</ref>

In IndyCar, [[A. J. Foyt]] won 10 out of 13 races on his way to his 4th national championship in [[1964 USAC Championship Car season|1964]]. In [[NASCAR]], [[Richard Petty]] holds most of the records for most wins in a season; he won 27 races out of 48 appearances in 1967, 10 of which were consecutive. Since the number of races in a season was reduced from upwards of 50 to approximately 30 in 1972, Petty also holds the "modern-era" record for most wins in a season with 13, a record he shares with [[Jeff Gordon]].<ref name=Daytona>{{cite book|title=Daytona: From the Birth of Speed to the Death of the Man in Black|last=Hinton|first=Ed|year=2001|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York|isbn=0-446-52677-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/daytona00edhi/page/118 118]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/daytona00edhi/page/118}}</ref>

In 1997, [[road racing|road racer]] [[Tommy Kendall]] started the 13-race [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] [[Trans-Am Series]] season 11–0, the longest documentable win streak in worldwide professional road racing. In the 12th race, Kendall was battling for the lead on the final lap, but spun out and finished second.<ref name="Deepthrottle">{{cite news

The feat would be extremely difficult in a series with a longer schedule, such as the [[NASCAR Cup Series]] which has 36 race seasons, [[Formula One]] which typically has between 17 and 23 race seasons, or the [[British Touring Car Championship]] which typically has 30 race seasons. However, in the [[2013 British Formula Ford Championship]] season, a then support series to BTCC following its schedule, [[Dan Cammish]] won all of first 24 out of 30 races and then opted out of the remaining 6 with the championship already decided.

In MotoGP/500cc perfect seasons have been achieved by [[John Surtees]] winning 7/7 races in [[1959 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1959]] and [[Giacomo Agostini]] winning 10/10 races in [[1968 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1968]]. These were in the earlier years of the 500cc championship where the racers were rewarded for their "best of number of races" at the end of the season but they won every race in the season.

In the [[AMA Motocross Championship]], [[Ricky Carmichael]] had perfect seasons in 2002 and 2004 winning both races at all 12 rounds in the premier 250cc 2-stroke class.{{clarify|date=November 2020}} This was repeated by [[James Stewart Jr.|James 'Bubba' Stewart]] in 2008 when the premier class was 450cc 4-stroke. and then by rookie [[Jett Lawrence]] in 2023.

In World Championship motocross [[Stefan Everts]] has come the closest with 17 wins in 18 races during the 2006 [[Motocross World Championship]] season.

===Golf===
Golf instead considers the [[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam]], a sweep of the four [[men's major golf championships]] deemed to be the most difficult contests in professional golf, to be analogous to perfection.

The only time the Grand Slam has been swept in any given year was 1930, when [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] won all four majors (at the time, [[The Amateur Championship|The (British) Amateur Championship]] and [[U.S. Amateur]] were still considered majors); since 1934, when [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]] was added as a major, no player has won all four in one year.

[[Tiger Woods]] is the only professional golfer to win four consecutive professional majors; he did so over two years in 2000 and 2001. The record for most consecutive wins in professional golf is 11, set [[Byron Nelson]] in 1945; Nelson would win 18 tournaments overall that year, a year when wartime manpower shortages were still limiting the number and quality of professional golfers for Nelson to compete against.

===Tennis===
Tennis also uses the term [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] for winning all four major tennis tournaments in a single year. This has only been achieved by five players in singles: [[Don Budge]], [[Rod Laver]], [[Maureen Connolly]], [[Margaret Court]] and [[Steffi Graf]]. Graf was the most recent to achieve the feat, in 1988, while Laver is the only one who did the feat twice, in 1962 and 1968.

Three other singles players have won four consecutive major tournaments in a row, but not in a single year: [[Novak Djokovic]], [[Martina Navratilova]], and [[Serena Williams]], with Williams having done so twice. Graf has a non-consecutive singles Grand Slam in addition to her calendar-year Grand Slam.

In doubles, only three teams have won the calendar-year Grand Slam. [[Ken McGregor]] and [[Frank Sedgman]] achieved the feat in men's doubles in 1951; Court and [[Ken Fletcher]] did so in mixed doubles in 1963, and Navratilova and [[Pam Shriver]] did so in women's doubles in 1984. One man and three women have individually won all four Grand Slam events in a year, but with different partners—[[Maria Bueno]] in women's doubles in 1960; Court in mixed doubles in 1965, [[Owen Davidson]] in mixed doubles in 1967, and [[Martina Hingis]] in women's doubles in 1998.

The non-calendar Grand Slam has been equally rare in doubles. The only men's team to win a non-calendar Grand Slam is the [[Bryan brothers]], who did so in 2012–13. In women's doubles, [[Louise Brough]] won with two different partners in 1949–50; Navratilova won five consecutive Grand Slam events with two different partners in 1986–87, teaming with Shriver for the last four of these; [[Gigi Fernández]] and [[Natasha Zvereva]] won six consecutive Slam events in 1992–93; Zvereva herself won four consecutive Slam events with different partners in 1996–97; and the [[Williams sisters]] (Serena and [[Venus Williams|Venus]]) achieved the feat in 2009–10. In mixed doubles, [[Billie Jean King]] teamed with Davidson for the last three events of his 1967 Grand Slam and completed the non-consecutive Grand Slam the next year with [[Dick Crealy]].

===NCAA Division I Basketball===

====Men====
Before the establishment of the [[National Invitation Tournament]] in 1938 and the [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]] in 1939, perfect seasons were more common; each season consisted of fewer games and top teams from different parts of the country might never meet.

Eight teams have completed perfect seasons, including postseason tournament victories, since the tournament era began in 1938:
* [[1938–39 Long Island Blackbirds men's basketball team|1939 LIU Blackbirds]] (24–0) — [[1939 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] champion, which at the time was more prestigious than the NCAA tournament
* [[1955–56 San Francisco Dons men's basketball team|1956 San Francisco Dons]] (29–0) — NCAA champion
* [[1956–57 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|1957 North Carolina Tar Heels]] (32–0) — NCAA champion
* [[1963–64 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1964 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) — NCAA champion
* [[1966–67 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1967 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) — NCAA champion
* [[1971–72 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1972 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) — NCAA champion
* [[1972–73 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1973 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) — NCAA champion
* [[1975–76 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1976 Indiana Hoosiers]] (32–0) — NCAA champion

In addition, four other teams in the tournament era had unbeaten records, but did not play in any postseason tournament:
* 1940 [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall Pirates]] (19–0) — not invited to either the NCAA Tournament or NIT.
* [[1943–44 Army Cadets men's basketball team|1944 Army Cadets]] (15–0) — not invited to either the NCAA Tournament or NIT. (Given that this season was during World War II, it is also possible that Army chose to turn down tournament invitations.)
* [[1953–54 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|1954 Kentucky Wildcats]] (25–0) — declined a bid to the NCAA Tournament due to an NCAA ruling that graduate students could not compete.
* 1973 [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|NC State Wolfpack]] (27–0) — ineligible for postseason competition due to rule violations earlier that season.

The UCLA Bruins are the only team to have back-to-back perfect seasons (1971–1972, 1972–1973), and all four of the college's perfect seasons were under Hall of Fame head coach [[John Wooden]]. Additionally, under Wooden, UCLA had a record [[Basketball winning streaks#UCLA streak – men's basketball – 88 games|88-game winning streak]], from 1971 to 1974.

The following teams completed a perfect regular season, but lost in the [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|NCAA tournament]] or other postseason action:
*[[1939 National Invitation Tournament|1939]] [[Loyola Ramblers men's basketball|Loyola Ramblers]] (finished regular season 20–0 and lost in the NIT final to [[1938–39 Long Island Blackbirds men's basketball team|LIU]] to finish 21–1)

===NCAA Ice Hockey===
Among schools in the top level of men's ice hockey, the 1969–70 [[Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey|Cornell Big Red]] went 29–0–0 in the University Division (the predecessor to today's Division I) en route to a national championship.

Since Cornell's 29–0–0 season in 1969–70, the closest Division I Men's Ice Hockey Team to having a perfect season was the 1992–93 [[Maine Black Bears men's ice hockey|Maine Black Bears]], who finished that year at 42–1–2, including a national title game victory against [[Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey|Lake Superior State]]. Their only loss came on February 19, 1993, against [[Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey|Boston University]], where they lost 7–6 in overtime, and their only ties were on October 24 against [[Providence Friars men's ice hockey|Providence]], 3–3, and on January 15 against [[Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey|Clarkson]], 4–4.

The last men's team to finish unbeaten and untied and be national champions was the 1983–84 [[Bemidji State Beavers men's ice hockey|Bemidji State Beavers]] (31–0–0), who were then competing in [[NCAA Division II|Division II]], a level of competition that no longer conducts a championship.
