{{Short description|Term used for football fans}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2014}}
The '''12th man''' or '''12th player''' is a collective term for [[Fan (person)|fans]] of sports teams in many eleven-a-side games, in particular [[association football]]. As most football leagues allow a maximum of eleven players per team on the playing field at a time, referring to a team's fans as the 12th man implies that they have a potentially helpful and significant role in the game.

The presence of fans can have a notable impact on how the teams perform, an element in the [[home advantage]]. Namely, the home team fans would vocally support and urge on their team to win the game. Thus these fans will often create loud sounds or [[football chant|chant]] in the hope of encouraging their team; or of distracting, demoralizing or confusing the opposing team while they have possession of the ball; or to persuade a referee to make a favorable decision to the team. Noises are made by shouting, singing, whistling, stomping, clapping and various other techniques.

In [[Canadian football]], 12 players from each team are usually on the field at one time and the term '''13th man''' is often used to refer to fans. Similarly, in [[Australian rules football]] 18 players are on the field and the fans are often referred to as the '''19th man'''. However, in [[basketball]], where five players are on the court, the term ''[[Sixth man]]'' generally refers to an energetic substitute player. Similarly, in [[rugby sevens]], with seven players from each team on the field, "Eighth man" is not used to refer to fans as the term refers to [[Number 8 (rugby union)|the eighth forward in rugby union]]. The term ''Twelfth Man'' has a specifically different meaning in [[cricket]], referring instead to the [[Glossary of cricket terms#twelfth man|nominated first substitute player]] who fields when a member of the fielding side is injured during play.

==History==
[[File:E king hill 12thman.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Texas A&M's E. King Gill during the 1921–1922 season]]

The first recorded use of the term "twelfth man" was a magazine published by the [[University of Minnesota]] in September 1900, that referred to "the mysterious influence of the twelfth man on the team, the [[cheering|rooter]]".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Editorial |journal=Minnesota Magazine |volume=7 |issue=September 1900 |page=32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5b4NAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA32 |publisher= University of Minnesota |author=Unknown|year=1900 }}</ref> Later, in the November 1912 edition of ''The Iowa Alumnus'', an alumni publication of the [[University of Iowa]] (then known as State University of Iowa), E. A. McGowan described the 1903 game between [[1903 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa]] and the [[1903 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|University of Illinois]]. In his article, "The Twelfth Player", McGowan wrote: "The eleven men had done their best; but the twelfth man on the team (the loyal spirited Iowa rooter) had won the game for old S.U.I."<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Twelfth Player |journal=The Iowa Alumnus |volume=10 |issue=November 1912 |page=30 |url= http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/uap/id/5706/rec/10 |publisher=University of Iowa.

The [[1922 Dixie Classic]] served as the setting for an event later referred to as "The story of the 12th Man".<ref>{{cite book |title= Sports and Understanding Organizations| editor-first =Daniel J.| editor-last= Svyantek|publisher=Information Age Publishing |location= Charlotte, North Carolina| year= 2017 |page=44|isbn=978-1681237923}}</ref> This football game featured the top-ranked [[1921 Centre Praying Colonels football team|Centre College]] and [[1921 Texas A&M Aggies football team|The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas]] (later known as Texas A&M). During the game, A&M coach [[Dana X. Bible]] realized that one more injury would leave him without another backfield player to send into the game. Bible called E. King Gill, a sophomore basketball player, down from the stands to stand ready as a substitute. Gill was ready in uniform on the sidelines if his team needed him.<ref>{{cite book|title=ESPN College Football Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Game| editor-first= Michael |editor-last= MacCambridge |publisher= ESPN Books|location=New York |year=2005|page=44|isbn=978-1401337032}}</ref>

Individuals have occasionally been labeled by local media as the "Twelfth Man" of their team. In 1930, W. H. Adamson, Principal of Oak Cliff (Dallas) High School was called the "Twelfth Man" of the school's American football team by a local reporter due to the rousing pre-game speeches he would give to the players. Likewise, sometimes, fans of both teams in an annual contest have been described as the 12th man.<ref>{{cite news |title=Twelfth Men |newspaper=[[Dallas Morning News]] |date=December 18, 1938 |issue=195 |url=http://www.hornsports.com/docs/aggy/DMN_Dec_18_1938.pdf |access-date=November 28, 2012 |archive-date=January 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109002224/http://www.hornsports.com/docs/aggy/DMN_Dec_18_1938.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Football coach [[Jackie Sherrill]] created the "12th Man Kick-Off Team" in the 1980s, composed of non-athletic scholarship students who tried out for the team. Coach Sherrill has written a book entitled "No Experience Required" which details this team and the tradition. These students were placed on the roster for the sole purpose of kickoffs. The squad was nicknamed "the suicide squad". These students often had little regard for their safety and were determined to make a tackle at any cost.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Durham|first1=Timothy|title=12th Man honors Sherrill|url=http://www.thebatt.com/2.8484/12th-man-honors-sherrill-1.1185209|website=The Battalion|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111230623/http://www.thebatt.com/2.8484/12th-man-honors-sherrill-1.1185209#.Ug3hNX3LfK4|archive-date=January 11, 2012|date=September 29, 2008}}</ref><ref name=NBCref>{{cite news|title=NBC Evening News |publisher=Vanderbilt Television News Archive |url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=532988 |date=September 2, 1983 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114205118/http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=532988 |archive-date=January 14, 2012 |url-status=live |access-date=May 22, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref> The 12th Man Kick-Off Team was extremely successful and eventually held opponents to one of the lowest yards-per-return average in the league during kickoffs.{{when|date=October 2014}}<ref name="12thMan">{{cite web|url=http://aggietraditions.tamu.edu/12thman.shtml |title=Twelfth Man |access-date=December 31, 2006 |publisher=Aggie Traditions |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229030439/http://aggietraditions.tamu.edu/12thman.shtml |archive-date=December 29, 2006 |url-status=dead  |df=mdy }}</ref> Later, head coach [[R.

The term "12th man" is commonly used in football to refer to [[Association football culture#Fans|the fans]] and occasionally the manager. A notable club famous for the twelfth man reference comes from [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], referring to the Holte End stand at Villa Park. Large European teams such as [[Bayern Munich]], [[Malmö FF]], [[Hammarby Fotboll|Hammarby IF]], [[Helsingborgs IF]], [[Werder Bremen]], [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], [[Feyenoord]], [[Ferencvárosi TC]], [[Red Star Belgrade|FC Red Star]], [[Fenerbahçe S.K.]], and [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting CP]] have officially retired the number 12 to the fans. [[Stockport County fans]] are registered as official members of their squad with the number 12.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} [[Portsmouth F.C.]] has also retired its number 12 shirt, and lists the club's supporters, "Pompey Fans", as player number 12 on the squad list printed in home match programmes,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} while [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] have theirs registered to the ''Green Army'' (the nickname for their fans).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Number 12 is also reserved for the fans at many other clubs, including [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]] and [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit Saint Petersburg]] in Russia, [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] and [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in England, as well as [[Aarhus Gymnastikforening]] (AGF), [[Odense Boldklub]], also known as [[Odense Boldklub|OB]], in Denmark, [[Malmö FF]] and [[Hammarby Fotboll|Hammarby IF]] in Sweden, [[Persija Jakarta]] in Indonesia, [[Botev Plovdiv]] in Bulgaria and [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]] in Australia. On [[Hammarby Fotboll|Hammarby IF]]'s, [[Helsingborgs IF]], [[Malmö FF]], [[Feyenoord]] and [[Werder Bremen]]'s home games, the stadium speaker announces number 12 as "the fans" during team lineup announcements.

[[Dynamo Dresden]] in Germany also keeps number 12 for their fans, as well as the official team anthem being "We are the 12th man". [[Aberdeen F.C.]] supporters commonly display a large banner in the shape of a football shirt with the text "Red Army 12" in place of a player's name and number.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The fans of the [[Northern Ireland national football team]] and [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] are referred to as the 12th man as well. In the [[League of Ireland]], [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.]] retired the number 12 jersey in recognition of the fans who took over the club in 2005.

==Other usage==
In American football, the sideline is sometimes also referred to as the "12th man" or "12th defender": since a player is considered down when he steps out of bounds, the sideline effectively acts as an extra defender. This usage is less common than the one referring to the fans. In most sports the term can also be construed to mean the [[referee (association football)|referee]], implying that the match official favours one team and is not impartial.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38576689 |title=Bacary Sagna: Man City defender charged by FA for Instagram post |date=2017-01-10 |website=[[BBC Sport]] |quote=The Football Association allege that the defender's post, which was later deleted, "questioned the integrity of the match official". |access-date=2017-01-12 |archive-date=February 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210062455/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38576689 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Effects==
The effects of the "12th man" vary widely, but can be put in two categories. The first is simply psychological, the effect of showing the home team that they are appreciated, and showing the away team that they are somewhat unwelcome. The second directly relates to the deafening effects of a loud crowd.

In Association football, the crowd can be very passionate and often sing throughout the whole match. Some occasions where the crowd noise is extra loud can be before kickoff; during the buildup to and scoring of a [[Goal (sport)|goal]]; when encouraging the team to come back from defeat; to discourage an opposition penalty taker; or to harass a [[Referee (association football)|referee]] giving a free kick to the opposition team.

In American football, fans are most incited by physical play, especially good plays made by the defense.<ref name="boling">{{Cite news|last=Boling |first=Dave |title=Artificial noise?

The noise of the crowd can have a significant impact on the players on the field. In American football, an extremely loud crowd can prevent the [[offensive linemen]] from hearing the [[snap count]]. This can have the effect of making the player slower to react when the ball is snapped, and his eventual response may be weaker than normal because each play is begun "with some indecision and doubt".<ref name=baldinger>{{Cite news |last=Baldinger |first=Brian |title=Gaps in action can kill home-field edge |newspaper=The Sporting News |date=January 12, 2004 |access-date=September 11, 2007 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/11863789/gaps-action-can-kill-home-field-edge |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024155814/http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/11863789/gaps-action-can-kill-home-field-edge |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 24, 2014 }}</ref> The noise can also prevent players from hearing [[American football|audibles]] and can make it difficult for the team's offense to coordinate plays in the huddle. The effect of the noise can often be measured in mistakes, such as [[false start]] penalties.<ref name=acee>{{Cite news|last=Acee |first=Kevin |title=They're right on Q |newspaper=[[The San Diego Tribune]] |date=December 26, 2006 |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20061226/news_1s26chargers.html |access-date=September 11, 2007 |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061227164227/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20061226/news_1s26chargers.html |archive-date=December 27, 2006 }}</ref>

Coaches can take steps to minimize the effect of the crowd noise on their teams. Some American football teams bring large speakers to their practice fields and broadcast loud noises such as jet engines to prepare their teams for the anticipated noise level.<ref>{{cite news|title=Panthers thrive in hostile environments|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2006/01/21/pro_47980.shtml|access-date=2 June 2014|work=[[The Augusta Chronicle]]|date=21 January 2006|archive-date=January 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109002224/http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2006/01/21/pro_47980.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref> Crowd noise tends to diminish after a long lull in play, such as a pause for [[instant replay]].

A researcher from [[Harvard University]] discovered in a study that some association football referees appeared to be impacted by crowd noise.

In August 2016, the Seahawks agreed to a new five-year trademark licensing agreement with Texas A&M. As part of the agreement, the Seahawks agreed to pay Texas A&M $140,000 for limited rights to use the trademarked term. This agreement, like the previous agreement, prohibits the Seahawks from using the "12th Man" term on any merchandise. The new agreement, however, also prohibits Seattle from using the term on social media, nor are they allowed to use the term on any signage within their stadium, including their Ring of Honor.<ref name= "espn.com"/>
