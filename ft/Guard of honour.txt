A '''guard of honour''' ([[Commonwealth English]]), '''honor guard''' ([[American English]]) or '''ceremonial guard''', is a group of people, typically drawn from the military, appointed to perform ceremonial duties – for example, to receive or guard a head of state or other dignitaries, the fallen in war, or to attend at state ceremonials, especially funerals. In military weddings, especially those of commissioned officers, a guard, composed usually of service members of the same branch, form the [[sabre arch]]. In principle, any military unit could act as a guard of honour. In some countries, certain units are specially assigned to undertake guard of honour postings or other [[public duties]]. [[Republican guard]]s, [[royal guards]] and [[foot guards]] frequently have ceremonial duties assigned to them.

Guards of honour also serve in the civilian world for fallen police officers, firefighters, and other civil servants. Uniformed firefighting and law enforcement personnel render military-style salutes, and color guards present the colors at funerals and memorial services for fallen firefighters, law enforcement personnel and other civil servants. Certain religious bodies, especially churches of the [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Methodism|Methodist movement]], have the tradition of an honour guard at the funeral of an ordained elder, in which all other ordained elders present "guard the line" between the door of the church and the grave, or [[hearse]] if the deceased is to be buried elsewhere or cremated.<ref>Traditions of the United Methodist Church</ref> [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Order of chivalry|chivalric orders]], such as the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre (Catholic)|Order of the Holy Sepulchre]] and the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], provide guards of honour for deceased knights and high-ranking officers during funerals.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Funeral of the Grand Master of the Order of Malta |url=https://www.orderofmalta.int/news/funeral-of-the-grand-master-of-the-order-of-malta/ |access-date=2022-09-25 |website=Sovereign Order of Malta |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Funeral Honor Guard {{!}} The Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem |url=https://eohsjeastern.org/funeral-honor-guard/ |access-date=2022-09-25 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, Members Funeral Protocols |url=https://www.holysepulchre.ie/index.php/members-funeral-protocols- |access-date=2022-09-25 |website=www.holysepulchre.ie |archive-date=25 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220925021801/https://www.holysepulchre.ie/index.php/members-funeral-protocols- |url-status=dead }}</ref> The practice of providing a guard of honour as a mark of respect also occurs in sports, especially throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

Guards of honour are also formed by civilian police, and fire services, including the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]. These civilian honour guards are typically mounted for funerals, and local ceremonies, with the honour guard units typically made up of 30 to 60 members. Some, like the [[York Regional Police]], operate a mounted honour guard unit. Fire and rescue ceremonial units such as the [[Toronto Fire Services]] Honour Guard and the Calgary Firefighters Honour Guard are unique in that they are armed with a ceremonial [[axe]].

Its ceremonial duties are usually performed at government buildings and notable areas in [[Havana]], with the [[Plaza de la Revolución]] (the main square in the capital) and the [[Palace of the Revolution]] (the workplace of the [[President of Cuba]]). The main purpose of the military unit is the performance of the changing of the guard every half an hour at the José Marti Mausoleum in [[Santiago de Cuba]]. Prior to [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[1959 Cuban Revolution]], honour guards were performed by units that resembled honour guard units in the [[United States]], such as [[3rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|The Old Guard]].

[[File:Barak pentagon 1999.jpg|thumb|Israeli prime minister [[Ehud Barak]] inspects a joint-services guard of honour, made up of personnel from the U.S. air force, army, and navy, 1999]]
The official honour guard of every branch is located in the [[Joint Force Headquarters National Capital Region|National Capital Region]], though nearly every military installation will have its own honour guard for local ceremonies and events. The honour guard units in National Capital Region, formed into the ''Joint Service Honor Guard of the National Capital Region and the Department of Defense'', an ad hoc unit of battalion size, represent the military as a whole and the United States as a nation, and perform numerous ceremonies on behalf of the President of the United States, the commander-in-chief of the federal Armed Forces, with musical accompaniment by each of the central bands of the Armed Forces based in the capital.

Since World War II, The [[3rd United States Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)]] has served as the official Army honour guard and escort to the President, and it also provides security for Washington, D.C., in time of national emergency or civil disturbance.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130919071020/http://www.oldguard.mdw.army.mil/regiment About the 3d U.S. Infantry Regiment, U.S. Army Official Website]; accessed 19 January 2017</ref> [[Arlington National Cemetery]]'s [[Tomb of the Unknowns]] is guarded by members of the U.S. 3rd Infantry Regiment.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130917001434/http://www.oldguard.mdw.army.mil/specialty-platoons/tomb-of-the-unknown Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, HHC, 4th Battalion, 3d U.S. Infantry Regiment, U.S. Army Official Website]; accessed 19 January 2017</ref> Since 2007, a Joint-Service Drill Competition has been held every April in front of the Reflecting Pool of the [[National Mall]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/37301/3rd_annual_joint_service_drill_exhibition|title=3rd Annual Joint Service Drill Exhibition|website=www.army.mil|date=13 April 2010 }}</ref> Other ceremonial military units also include the [[Royal Guards of Hawaii]] of the [[Air National Guard]] and the [[High Frontier Honor Guard]] at [[Peterson Air Force Base]].

Many local, state, national and federal public safety agencies in the United States maintain Honour Guards, Pipes & Drums and Buglers, including fire departments, law enforcement agencies, emergency medical services, and search and rescue agencies, who typically use adaptations of military honour guards, and honour those who die in the line of duty (LODD-Line of Duty Death), off-duty but still on the job, and retirees, as well as participating in support of other agencies, and parades. Some Law Enforcement agencies are able to maintain a Rifle Team for 'three volley' salutes. Most, even those within major career paid agencies, are not paid for performing and preparing for the honour guard duty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

====Venezuela====
The [[Presidential Honor Guard (Venezuela)|Presidential Honour Guard]] is the joint service military unit mandated to ensure the immediate security of the [[President of Venezuela]] and his First Family and for the performance of public duties in the most important places in the country. The most distant antecedents of the Presidential Honour Guard go back to the Hussars Troop of Simon Bolivar, of the Venezuelan War of Independence and of the larger Spanish American wars of independence, raised in June 1815 and part of a more bigger guards brigade targeted for the immediate security of the Liberator, and the early 20th century 1st Cavalry Regiment "Ambrosio Plaza" that until the 1950s, albeit reduced to squadron size, provided the ceremonial security of the President and was modeled on the Prussian horse guards units of the late 19th century.
[[File:El Salvador President at Maduro inauguration 2019 01.jpg|thumb|El Salvadorian president [[Salvador Sánchez Cerén]] walk through an honour guard cordon formed by members of the Venezuelan military, 2019]]
The modern brigade serves as a ceremonial escort to the President of Venezuela at [[Miraflores Palace]] and attends all state arrival ceremonies conducted there, as well as providing security for the palace complex. The brigade also provides honour guards (i) at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Carabobo Field, Carabobo commemorating the memory of national heroes and the fallen of the [[Battle of Carabobo]] of 1821, (ii) at the Montana Barracks in Caracas in memory of the late [[Hugo Chavez|Hugo Chávez]]; and (iii) at the National Pantheon in Caracas in memory of Bolívar and other national heroes buried there. The brigade also performs public duties functions as required. Brigade personnel come from all branches of the [[National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela]] (NBAF) and public security services. The brigade is commanded by a general or flag officer and includes a Presidential mounted escort of platoon or troop size, all wear the busby when in full dress.

Aside from the PHGB, there are two other foot guards battalions in the NBAF, the Caracas Foot Guards Battalion of the Ministry of Defence, and the [[Daniel Florence O'Leary Headquarters Battalion|Brigadier Daniel Florence O'Leary Headquarters and HQ Services Foot Guards Battalion]] of the Venezuelan Army Headquarters. Both foot guard battalions are also tasked with forming guards of honour and public duties. These two battalions wear berets instead of combat helmets when in full dress, when in historical dress the shako is worn.

====Russia====
The Russian [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Imperial Guards]] served as honour guards for the [[Russian Empire]] for many centuries prior to the [[February Revolution]]. Russian honour guards have been considered to have laid out the foundation and model for honour guards in the former [[Soviet Union]], and many of the pioneer guardsmen in these units came from the Imperial Guard, who then taught the first generation of honour guardsmen in ceremonial duties. Russia's primary honour guard ({{langx|ru|Почётный караул}}, Pochotny kara-ul) is the [[Kremlin Regiment]] of the [[Federal Protective Service (Russia)|Federal Protective Service of the Russian Federation]], established in 1936, which is organized into a four battalion regiment, with two battalions designated as guards of honour, one infantry and one cavalry. This regiment is more known for its modern Imperial Guard inspired uniforms, which are worn on more important occasions, these were introduced for the first time in 2004 on the basis of uniforms of the former infantry and cavalry regiments of the Imperial Guards in Saint Petersburg.

The [[Kyiv Presidential Honor Guard Battalion|Kyiv Honour Guard Battalion]], which is part of [[Separate Presidential Brigade|Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky Independent Presidential Guard Brigade]], is the official ceremonial guard of honour unit of the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://novynarnia.com/2017/11/10/u-viyskah-vidznachili-yuviley-pochesnoyi-varti-minoboroni-ukrayini-stvorenoyi-1962-roku-v-srsr/|title=У військах відзначили ювілей Почесної варти МІНОБОРОНИ УКРАЇНИ, створеної 1962 року в СРСР|date=10 November 2017}}</ref> It was formed from the guard of honour units in the [[Ukrainian SSR]]'s [[Kiev Military District]]. Besides the HQ company, the battalion maintains three companies, a Military Band, and a Symbols Protection Company.

The [[Special Honor Guard Battalion|NGU National Special Honour Guard Battalion]] of the [[National Guard of Ukraine]] is actively in use for many ceremonial activities, and was also in service prior to the disbandment of the [[Internal Troops of Ukraine]] in 2014.

A guard of honour is formed to present formal ceremonial compliments to royal or presidential dignitaries by a guard not exceeding 100 personnel (including three officers, one with a colour) with other particular distinguished individuals saluted by a guard not exceeding 50 personnel. A ''half guard'' is a colloquial term describing a guard of honour of not more than 50 personnel (including two officers, one with a colour).<ref>''RAF Drill and Ceremonial'' AP 818 7th Edition</ref> A guard of honour could have a single service contingent (e.g. army) or it could be a tri-service (inter-service) affair. The guard commander, after saluting the dignitary (usually head of state), marches up to him or her and escorts him or her to inspect the guard (soldiers in formation). During the salute, the national anthems of both the dignitary's country and the host country are usually played by a ceremonial band.

Only a [[War flag|standard]], [[Guidon (heraldic flag)|guidon]], King’s Colour, or a [[banner]] presented by either a member of the Royal Family or the governor-general may be carried by a royal guard of honour. Only a regimental colour or a banner presented by a personage other than a member of the Royal Family may be carried on a half guard of honour. A smaller unit honouring distinguished visitors at a military installation is known as a ''quarter guard''. The commander is three paces in front of the second file from the right and accompanies the personage for whom the guard is mounted. An officer carrying the Colour stands three paces in front of the centre; if there is a third officer he will be three paces in front of the second file from the other flank.<ref>p.128 ''Guards of honour'' from ''Ceremonial 1912''</ref>

Units that traditionally perform ceremonial duties, such as Guard Mounting ([[changing of the King’s Guard]]) or [[Trooping the Colour]], are the five regiments of Foot Guards and the [[Household Cavalry]] ([[Blues and Royals]] and [[Life Guards (United Kingdom)|Life Guards]]), which form the Household Division whilst the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] form the Guard of Honour when foreign Heads of State visit London.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.army.mod.uk/who-we-are/formations-divisions-brigades/force-troops-command/1st-intelligence-surveillance-and-reconnaissance-brigade/honourable-artillery-company/| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181206234939/https://www.army.mod.uk/who-we-are/formations-divisions-brigades/force-troops-command/1st-intelligence-surveillance-and-reconnaissance-brigade/honourable-artillery-company/| archive-date = 2018-12-06| title = Honourable Artillery Company {{!}} The British Army}}</ref> The [[Royal Air Force]]'s ceremonial unit is the [[King's Colour Squadron]]. The British Armed Forces do not have dedicated ceremonial units other than the [[King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery]] and [[British Army incremental infantry companies|the Guards and Royal Regiment of Scotland Incremental Companies]].

The [[King's Guard]] is primarily made up of units from the Household Division for royal palaces and public monuments—namely [[Buckingham Palace]], [[St James's Palace]], [[Windsor Castle]], and the [[Tower of London]]—and other units from all three services of the British Armed Forces filling in when not deployed; in [[Scotland]], [[Holyrood Palace]] and [[Edinburgh Castle]] are usually the responsibility of Scottish regiments or units based in [[Edinburgh]].<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/events/ceremonial/23242.aspx The Queen's Guard] – [[British Army]] website</ref> Occasionally units from Commonwealth militaries are given the honour.<ref>{{cite news|title=Navy News – On guard|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/navynews/editions/2000/08_07_00/story01.htm|publisher=[[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]|date=7 August 2000}}</ref>

The ''de facto'' military force of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]] is the ''Pontificia Cohors Helvetica'' ("Papal Swiss Cohort"). Popularly known as the [[Swiss Guard]], this 135 strong unit is formed by unmarried Swiss Catholic former servicemen aged between 19 and 30 years, recruited through a special convention with the Swiss Government. While largely performing ceremonial honour guard duties with traditional weapons (halberds, [[Partisan (weapon)|partisans]] and swords), the Swiss Guard is also equipped with modern military light weapons and trained in proper military and security duties. The Guard provides one of two official procotol bands in the country.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
The tri-service [[Australia's Federation Guard|Federation Guard]] – consisting of members of the [[Australian Army]], the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and the [[Royal Australian Navy]] – provides the guard of honour for various ceremonies. It is the only military unit of its kind currently in the [[Australian Defence Force]]. All members of the guard are enlisted in their respective areas before volunteering for service in the guard. They are armed with [[L1A1 SLR]] rifles.

====Fiji====

The Army portion of the company is notable for its highly distinctive [[Campaign hat|"lemon squeezer" hat]].

==Sports==
===Association football===
In recent years, [[association football]] teams have shown their respect to teams in their own division which have already won the championship of the division with games to spare by forming a guard of honour onto or off the pitch for their players,<ref>{{cite web |title=What is a guard of honour? Is it compulsory? Who has had one? |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11096/11336825/what-is-a-guard-of-honour-is-it-compulsory-who-has-had-one |website=Sky Sports |access-date=2 July 2020}}</ref> an example of which could be seen in the [[2019–20 Premier League]] season, where champions [[Liverpool F.C.]] received guards of honour from Manchester City, Aston Villa, Brighton, Burnley, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle after they claimed the Premier League title with seven games to spare. The applauding team forms two lines to make a corridor and the league winners pass through the corridor, generally in single file.

Occasionally, guards of honour may also be granted for cup winners. An example could be seen at the [[2024–25 Premier League]] match in May 2025 between [[Liverpool F.C]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.]] where Liverpool, who had been given a guard of honour by Crystal Palace for having won the Premier League title with 4 matchdays to spare, reciprocated by giving a guard of honour to Crystal Palace, who had won the [[2025 FA Cup final]] a week earlier.<ref>{{cite web |title=TWO guards of honour at Anfield before Liverpool v Crystal Palace 👏 Crystal Palace congratulate Liverpool for winning the Premier League, then the Reds return the favour to celebrate Palace's FA Cup triumph |url=https://www.instagram.com/premierleague/p/DKFNYduRebw/ |website=Instagram |publisher=Premier League |access-date=25 May 2025}}</ref>

The guard of honour is in some instances considered good form to perform but is not considered compulsory and teams may opt not to provide one, as especially tends to happen between teams considered particularly bitter rivals.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport/football/hearts/hibernian-will-not-grant-hearts-a-guard-of-honour-1-3742425 |title=Hibernian will not grant Hearts a guard of honour |work=[[Edinburgh News]] |date=10 April 2015 |access-date=29 December 2017 |archive-date=30 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190930023336/https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport/football/hearts/hibernian-will-not-grant-hearts-a-guard-of-honour-1-3742425 |url-status=dead }}</ref> For example, [[Real Madrid CF]] declined to give [[El Clásico|bitter rivals]] [[FC Barcelona]] a guard of honour in 2018 when the latter won the league title, and [[Atlético Madrid]] declined to give a guard of honour to Real Madrid in 2022 when the latter won the league title, due to the [[Madrid derby|bitter rivalry between the two clubs]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonn |first1=Kyle |title=What is a guard of honor in football?

===Australian rules football===
In [[Australian rules football]], players will often form a guard of honour for those who are leaving the field after a landmark game or on their retirement game. For example, Fremantle formed a guard of honour for Fitzroy's last match in 1996; [[Melbourne F.C.|Melbourne]] and [[Essendon F.C.|Essendon]] formed a guard in 2005 to honour [[Indian Ocean tsunami]] victim [[Troy Broadbridge]]; and [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] formed a guard of honour in 2006 for retiring player [[Saverio Rocca]], who forged a successful goalkicking career at both clubs. After playing in the [[Auskick]] games at half time of senior matches, the junior players line up to form a guard of honour for when the players return to the field.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://open.abc.net.au/posts/our-sideline-snub-64rk7hp|title=Port Power missed our guard of honour|first= Emma |last=Pedler |date=30 July 2013}}</ref>

===Cricket===

In [[cricket]], the guard of honour is used to celebrate the achievement of a player (usually as a [[batsman]]), normally used during a player's final game. The players' teammates or opposition form a cordon, with their bats at the second count of the draw sabre forming an arch, and the successful player walks through. It may also be performed to mark a milestone, such as when a player breaks a world record. A player can receive guard of honour multiple times as they retire from different forms of the game separately. When a bowler retires, it would generally be when they leave the field for the final time, or when they play their final match in a certain venue of importance (away match, home ground, retiring on the same day a ground is due to be demolished).

===Field hockey===
In recent times guard of honour is usually done among hockey players for those who have done something valuable for their country like [[Balbir Singh Sr]] or [[Jamie Dwyer]].
