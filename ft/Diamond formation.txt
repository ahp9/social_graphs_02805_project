A '''diamond formation''' is a formation of four or more [[aircraft]], [[Cavalry|soldiers on horseback]], players in a [[team sport]], etc., wherein the elements of the group adopt a [[Rhombus|diamond]], or [[kite]], shape.

As few as four aircraft can establish the formation and conventionally the largest number is sixteen, in "tight formation":  1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Rarely attempted on [[jet aircraft]], this feat was first achieved by the [[Pakistan Air Force]] flying U.S.-made [[F-86 Sabre]]s<!--(Battle of Pakistan,1965 by John Fricker)--> in February 1958. It is considered a difficult formation as the aircraft have to fly very close to one another to create the desired effect. The larger the number of aircraft involved, the higher the [[risk]], as compared to other formations.

== Military ==
Diamond formations have been used in warfare, particularly by [[cavalry]], throughout known history.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gabriel|first=Richard A.|title=Soldiers' lives through history: the ancient world|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2007|pages=95|isbn=978-0-313-33348-4}}</ref> Thessalian cavalry was especially famous for the formation since it could change direction quickly.
