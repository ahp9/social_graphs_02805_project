The '''First XI''' (or, less commonly, '''First 11''') are the eleven primary players in an organisation's leading team, particularly a [[Association football|football]] or [[cricket]] team. A player who is considered a core part of the starting line-up in a First XI team is often the most proficient in their particular position. 

The name is a reference to the fact that they are the first eleven players selected to play for the team—many sports state that clubs must have squads of no fewer than <math>x</math> number of players, and this number is often higher than 11. For example, in the [[Premier League]], each club has to designate a squad of 25.
