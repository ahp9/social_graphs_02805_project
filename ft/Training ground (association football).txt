A '''training ground''' is an area where professional [[association football]] teams prepare for matches, with activities primarily concentrating on [[soccer skills|skills]] and fitness. They also sometimes form part of a club's [[youth system]], as clubs consider it important to have good facilities to aid the development of young players.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/7509518.stm Pompey training ground approved], [[BBC Sport]], 16 July 2008.</ref>

Training grounds are usually separate from a team's [[Soccer stadium|stadium]], as clubs use the facilities to avoid overusing the stadium's [[Soccer field|pitch]]. However, teams usually train inside the opposing team's stadium on the day before a [[UEFA|European]] away game, both for the benefit of the [[media (press)|media]] and to become familiar with the surface.
